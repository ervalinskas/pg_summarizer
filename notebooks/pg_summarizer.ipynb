       "  'essay_text': \"I finally realized today why politics and religion yield suchuniquely useless discussions.As a rule, any mention of religion on an online forum degeneratesinto a religious argument.  Why?  Why does this happen with religionand not with Javascript or baking or other topics people talk abouton forums?What's different about religion is that people don't feel they needto have any particular expertise to have opinions aboutit.  All they need is strongly held beliefs, and anyone can havethose.  No thread about Javascript will grow as fast as one aboutreligion, because people feel they have to be over some thresholdof expertise to post comments about that.  But on religion everyone'san expert.Then it struck me: this is the problem with politics too.  Politics,like religion, is a topic where there's no threshold of expertisefor expressing an opinion.  All you need is strong convictions.Do religion and politics have something in common that explainsthis similarity?  One possible explanation is that they deal withquestions that have no definite answers, so there's no back pressureon people's opinions.  Since no one can be proven wrong, everyopinion is equally valid, and sensing this, everyone lets fly withtheirs.But this isn't true.  There are certainly some political questionsthat have definite answers, like how much a new government policywill cost.  But the more precise political questions suffer thesame fate as the vaguer ones.I think what religion and politics have in common is that theybecome part of people's identity, and people can never have afruitful argument about something that's part of their identity.By definition they're partisan.Which topics engage people's identity depends on the people, notthe topic.  For example, a discussion about a battle that includedcitizens of one or more of the countries involved would probablydegenerate into a political argument.  But a discussion today abouta battle that took place in the Bronze Age probably wouldn't.  Noone would know what side to be on.  So it's not politics that's thesource of the trouble, but identity.  When people say a discussionhas degenerated into a religious war, what they really mean is thatit has started to be driven mostly by people's identities.Because the point at which this happens depends on the people ratherthan the topic, it's a mistake to conclude that because a questiontends to provoke religious wars, it must have no answer. For example,the question of the relative merits of programming languages oftendegenerates into a religious war, because so many programmersidentify as X programmers or Y programmers.  This sometimes leadspeople to conclude the question must be unanswerable—that alllanguages are equally good.  Obviously that's false: anything elsepeople make can be well or badly designed; why should this beuniquely impossible for programming languages?  And indeed, you canhave a fruitful discussion about the relative merits of programminglanguages, so long as you exclude people who respond from identity.More generally, you can have a fruitful discussion about a topiconly if it doesn't engage the identities of any of theparticipants.  What makes politics and religion such minefields isthat they engage so many people's identities.  But you could inprinciple have a useful conversation about them with some people.And there are other topics that might seem harmless, like therelative merits of Ford and Chevy pickup trucks, that you couldn'tsafely talk about withothers.The most intriguing thing about this theory, if it's right, is thatit explains not merely which kinds of discussions to avoid, but howto have better ideas.  If people can't think clearly about anythingthat has become part of their identity, then all other things beingequal, the best plan is to let as few things into your identity aspossible.Most people reading this will already be fairly tolerant.  But thereis a step beyond thinking of yourself as x but tolerating y: noteven to consider yourself an x.  The more labels you have foryourself, the dumber they make you.\"},\n",
       " {'title': 'Heresy',\n",
       "  'date': 'April 2022',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'One of the most surprising things I\\'ve witnessed in my lifetime isthe rebirth of the concept of heresy.In his excellent biography of Newton, Richard Westfall writes about themoment when he was elected a fellow of Trinity College:Supported comfortably, Newton was free to devote himself wholly  to whatever he chose. To remain on, he had only to avoid the three  unforgivable sins: crime, heresy, and marriage.The first time I read that, in the 1990s, it sounded amusinglymedieval. How strange, to have to avoid committing heresy. But whenI reread it 20 years later it sounded like a description ofcontemporary employment.There are an ever-increasing number of opinions you can be firedfor. Those doing the firing don\\'t use the word \"heresy\" to describethem, but structurally they\\'re equivalent. Structurally there aretwo distinctive things about heresy: (1) that it takes priorityover the question of truth or falsity, and (2) that it outweighseverything else the speaker has done.For example, when someone calls a statement \"x-ist,\" they\\'re alsoimplicitly saying that this is the end of the discussion. They donot, having said this, go on to consider whether the statement istrue or not. Using such labels is the conversational equivalent ofsignalling an exception. That\\'s one of the reasons they\\'re used:to end a discussion.If you find yourself talking to someone who uses these labels alot, it might be worthwhile to ask them explicitly if they believeany babies are being thrown out with the bathwater. Can a statementbe x-ist, for whatever value of x, and also true? If the answer isyes, then they\\'re admitting to banning the truth. That\\'s obviousenough that I\\'d guess most would answer no. But if they answer no,it\\'s easy to show that they\\'re mistaken, and that in practice suchlabels are applied to statements regardless of their truth orfalsity.The clearest evidence of this is that whether a statement isconsidered x-ist often depends on who said it. Truth doesn\\'t workthat way. The same statement can\\'t be true when one person says it,but x-ist, and therefore false, when another person does.The other distinctive thing about heresies, compared to ordinaryopinions, is that the public expression of them outweighs everythingelse the speaker has done. In ordinary matters, like knowledge ofhistory, or taste in music, you\\'re judged by the average of youropinions. A heresy is qualitatively different. It\\'s like droppinga chunk of uranium onto the scale.Back in the day (and still, in some places) the punishment forheresy was death. You could have led a life of exemplary goodness,but if you publicly doubted, say, the divinity of Christ, you weregoing to burn. Nowadays, in civilized countries, heretics only getfired in the metaphorical sense, by losing their jobs. But thestructure of the situation is the same: the heresyoutweighs everything else. You could have spent the last ten yearssaving children\\'s lives, but if you express certain opinions, you\\'reautomatically fired.It\\'s much the same as if you committed a crime. No matter howvirtuously you\\'ve lived, if you commit a crime, you must stillsuffer the penalty of the law. Having lived a previously blamelesslife might mitigate the punishment, but it doesn\\'t affect whetheryou\\'re guilty or not.A heresy is an opinion whose expression is treated like a crime —one that makes some people feel not merely that you\\'re mistaken,but that you should be punished. Indeed, their desire to see youpunished is often stronger than it would be if you\\'d committed anactual crime. There are many on the far left who believestrongly in the reintegration of felons (as I do myself), and yetseem to feel that anyone guilty of certain heresies should neverwork again.There are always some heresies — some opinions you\\'d be punishedfor expressing. But there are a lot more now than there were a fewdecades ago, and even those who are happy about this would have toagree that it\\'s so.Why? Why has this antiquated-sounding religious concept come backin a secular form? And why now?You need two ingredients for a wave of intolerance: intolerantpeople, and an ideology to guide them. The intolerant people arealways there. They exist in every sufficiently large society. That\\'swhy waves of intolerance can arise so suddenly; all they need issomething to set them off.I\\'ve already written anessaydescribing the aggressivelyconventional-minded. The short version is that people can beclassified in two dimensions according to (1) how independent- orconventional-minded they are, and (2) how aggressive they are aboutit. The aggressively conventional-minded are the enforcers oforthodoxy.Normally they\\'re only locally visible. They\\'re the grumpy, censoriouspeople in a group — the ones who are always first to complain whensomething violates the current rules of propriety. But occasionally,like a vector field whose elements become aligned, a large numberof aggressively conventional-minded people unite behind some ideologyall at once. Then they become much more of a problem, because a mobdynamic takes over, where the enthusiasm of each participant isincreased by the enthusiasm of the others.The most notorious 20th century case may have been the CulturalRevolution. Though initiated by Mao to undermine his rivals, theCultural Revolution was otherwise mostly a grass-roots phenomenon.Mao said in essence: There are heretics among us. Seek them out andpunish them. And that\\'s all the aggressively conventional-mindedever need to hear. They went at it with the delight of dogs chasingsquirrels.To unite the conventional-minded, an ideology must have many of thefeatures of a religion. In particular it must have strict andarbitrary rules that adherents can demonstrate theirpurityby obeying, and its adherents must believe that anyone who obeys theserules is ipso facto morally superior to anyone who doesn\\'t.In the late 1980s a new ideology of this type appeared in USuniversities. It had a very strong component of moral purity, andthe aggressively conventional-minded seized upon it with their usualeagerness — all the more because the relaxation of social normsin the preceding decades meant there had been less and less toforbid. The resulting wave of intolerance has been eerily similarin form to the Cultural Revolution, though fortunately much smallerin magnitude.I\\'ve deliberately avoided mentioning any specific heresies here.Partly because one of the universal tactics of heretic hunters, nowas in the past, is to accuse those who disapprove of the way inwhich they suppress ideas of being heretics themselves. Indeed,this tactic is so consistent that you could use it as a way ofdetecting witch hunts in any era.And that\\'s the second reason I\\'ve avoided mentioning any specificheresies. I want this essay to work in the future, not just now.And unfortunately it probably will. The aggressively conventional-mindedwill always be among us, looking for things to forbid. All theyneed is an ideology to tell them what. And it\\'s unlikely the currentone will be the last.There are aggressively conventional-minded people on both the rightand the left. The reason the current wave of intolerance comes fromthe left is simply because the new unifying ideology happened tocome from the left. The next one might come from the right. Imaginewhat that would be like.Fortunately in western countries the suppression of heresies isnothing like as bad as it used to be. Though the window of opinionsyou can express publicly has narrowed in the last decade, it\\'s stillmuch wider than it was a few hundred years ago. The problem is thederivative. Up till about 1985 the window had been growing everwider. Anyone looking into the future in 1985 would have expectedfreedom of expression to continue to increase. Instead it hasdecreased.The situation is similar to what\\'s happened with infectious diseaseslike measles. Anyone looking into the future in 2010 would haveexpected the number of measles cases in the US to continue todecrease. Instead, thanks to anti-vaxxers, it has increased. Theabsolute number is still not that high. The problem is the derivative.In both cases it\\'s hard to know how much to worry. Is it reallydangerous to society as a whole if a handful of extremists refuseto get their kids vaccinated, or shout down speakers at universities?The point to start worrying is presumably when their efforts startto spill over into everyone else\\'s lives. And in both cases thatdoes seem to be happening.So it\\'s probably worth spending some amount of effort on pushingback to keep open the window of free expression. My hope is thatthis essay will help form social antibodies not just against currentefforts to suppress ideas, but against the concept of heresy ingeneral. That\\'s the real prize. How do you disable the concept ofheresy? Since the Enlightenment, western societies have discoveredmany techniques for doing that, but there are surely more to bediscovered.Overall I\\'m optimistic. Though the trend in freedom of expressionhas been bad over the last decade, it\\'s been good over the longerterm. And there are signs that the current wave of intolerance ispeaking. Independent-minded people I talk to seem more confidentthan they did a few years ago. On the other side, even some of theleadersare starting to wonder if things have gone too far. And popular culture among the young has already moved on. All we haveto do is keep pushing back, and the wave collapses. And then we\\'llbe net ahead, because as well as having defeated this wave, we\\'llalso have developed new tactics for resisting the next one.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.July 2010I realized recently that what one thinks about in the shower in themorning is more important than I\\'d thought.  I knew it was a goodtime to have ideas.  Now I\\'d go further: now I\\'d say it\\'s hard todo a really good job on anything you don\\'t think about in the shower.Everyone who\\'s worked on difficult problems is probably familiarwith the phenomenon of working hard to figure something out, failing,and then suddenly seeing the answer a bit later while doing somethingelse. There\\'s a kind of thinking you do without trying to.  I\\'mincreasingly convinced this type of thinking is not merely helpfulin solving hard problems, but necessary.  The tricky part is, youcan only control it indirectly.I think most people have one top idea in their mind at any giventime.  That\\'s the idea their thoughts will drift toward when they\\'reallowed to drift freely.  And this idea will thus tend to get allthe benefit of that type of thinking, while others are starved ofit.  Which means it\\'s a disaster to let the wrong idea become thetop one in your mind.What made this clear to me was having an idea I didn\\'t want as thetop one in my mind for two long stretches.I\\'d noticed startups got way less done when they started raisingmoney, but it was not till we ourselves raised money that I understoodwhy.  The problem is not the actual time it takes to meet withinvestors.  The problem is that once you start raising money, raisingmoney becomes the top idea in your mind.  That becomes what youthink about when you take a shower in the morning.  And that meansother questions aren\\'t.I\\'d hated raising money when I was running Viaweb, but I\\'d forgottenwhy I hated it so much.  When we raised money for Y Combinator, Iremembered.  Money matters are particularly likely to become thetop idea in your mind.  The reason is that they have to be.  It\\'shard to get money.  It\\'s not the sort of thing that happens bydefault.  It\\'s not going to happen unless you let it become thething you think about in the shower.  And then you\\'ll make littleprogress on anything else you\\'d rather be working on.(I hear similar complaints from friends who are professors.  Professorsnowadays seem to have become professional fundraisers who do alittle research on the side.  It may be time to fix that.)The reason this struck me so forcibly is that for most of thepreceding 10 years I\\'d been able to think about what I wanted.  Sothe contrast when I couldn\\'t was sharp.  But I don\\'t think thisproblem is unique to me, because just about every startup I\\'ve seengrinds to a halt when they start raising money — ortalkingto acquirers.You can\\'t directly control where your thoughts drift.  If you\\'recontrolling them, they\\'re not drifting.  But you can control themindirectly, by controlling what situations you let yourself getinto.  That has been the lesson for me: be careful what you letbecome critical to you.  Try to get yourself into situations wherethe most urgent problems are ones you want to think about.You don\\'t have complete control, of course.  An emergency couldpush other thoughts out of your head.  But barring emergencies youhave a good deal of indirect control over what becomes the top ideain your mind.I\\'ve found there are two types of thoughts especially worthavoiding — thoughts like the Nile Perch in the way they pushout more interesting ideas.  One I\\'ve already mentioned: thoughtsabout money. Getting money is almost by definition an attentionsink.The other is disputes.  These too are engaging in thewrong way: they have the same velcro-like shape as genuinelyinteresting ideas, but without the substance.  So avoid disputesif you want to get real work done.Even Newton fell into this trap.  After publishing his theory ofcolors in 1672 he found himself distracted by disputes for years,finally concluding that the only solution was to stop publishing:I see I have made myself a slave to Philosophy, but if I get free  of Mr Linus\\'s business I will resolutely bid adew to it eternally,  excepting what I do for my privat satisfaction or leave to come  out after me.  For I see a man must either resolve to put out  nothing new or become a slave to defend it.Linus and his students at Liege were among the more tenaciouscritics.  Newton\\'s biographer Westfall seems to feel he wasoverreacting:Recall that at the time he wrote, Newton\\'s \"slavery\" consisted  of five replies to Liege, totalling fourteen printed pages, over  the course of a year.I\\'m more sympathetic to Newton. The problem was not the 14 pages,but the pain of having this stupid controversy constantly reintroducedas the top idea in a mind that wanted so eagerly to think aboutother things.Turning the other cheek turns out to have selfish advantages.Someone who does you an injury hurts you twice: first by the injuryitself, and second by taking up your time afterward thinking aboutit.  If you learn to ignore injuries you can at least avoid thesecond half.

       "  'essay_text': 'This essay developed out of conversations I\\'ve had withseveral other programmers about why Java smelled suspicious.  It\\'s nota critique of Java!  It is a case study of hacker\\'s radar.Over time, hackers develop a nose for good (and bad) technology.I thought it might be interesting to try and write down whatmade Java seem suspect to me.Some people who\\'ve read this think it\\'s an interesting attempt to write aboutsomething that hasn\\'t been written about before.  Others say Iwill get in trouble for appearing to be writing aboutthings I don\\'t understand.  So, just incase it does any good, let me clarify that I\\'m not writing hereabout Java (which I have never used) but about hacker\\'s radar(which I have thought about a lot).The aphorism \"you can\\'t tell a book by its cover\" originated inthe times when books were sold in plain cardboard covers, to bebound by each purchaser according to his own taste.  In those days,you couldn\\'t tell a book by its cover.  But publishing has advancedsince then: present-day publishers work hard to make the coversomething you can tell a book by.I spend a lot of time in bookshops and I feel as if I have by nowlearned to understand everything publishers mean to tell me abouta book, and perhaps a bit more.  The time I haven\\'t spent inbookshops I\\'ve spent mostly in front of computers, and I feel asif I\\'ve learned, to some degree, to judge technology by its coveras well.  It may be just luck, but I\\'ve saved myself from a fewtechnologies that turned out to be real stinkers.So far, Java seems like a stinker to me.  I\\'ve never written a Javaprogram, never more than glanced over reference books about it,but I have a hunch that it won\\'t be a very successful language.I may turn out to be mistaken; making predictions about technologyis a dangerous business.  But for what it\\'s worth, as a sort oftime capsule, here\\'s why I don\\'t like the look of Java:1. It has been so energetically hyped.  Real standards don\\'t haveto be promoted.  No one had to promote C, or Unix, or HTML.  A realstandard tends to be already established by the time most peoplehear about it.  On the hacker radar screen, Perl is as big as Java,or bigger, just on the strength of its own merits.2. It\\'s aimed low.  In the original Java white paper, Goslingexplicitly says Java was designed not to be too difficult forprogrammers used to C.  It was designed to be another C++: C plusa few ideas taken from more advanced languages.  Like the creatorsof sitcoms or junk food or package tours, Java\\'s designers wereconsciously designing a product for people not as smart as them.Historically, languages designed for other people to use have beenbad:  Cobol, PL/I, Pascal, Ada, C++.  The good languages have beenthose that were designed for their own creators:  C, Perl, Smalltalk,Lisp.3. It has ulterior motives.  Someone once said that the world wouldbe a better place if people only wrote books because they hadsomething to say, rather than because they wanted to write a book.Likewise, the reason we hear about Java all the time is not becauseit has something to say about programming languages.  We hear aboutJava as part of a plan by Sun to undermine Microsoft.4. No one loves it.  C, Perl, Python, Smalltalk, and Lisp programmerslove their languages.  I\\'ve never heard anyone say that they lovedJava.5. People are forced to use it.  A lot of the people I know usingJava are using it because they feel they have to.  Either it\\'ssomething they felt they had to do to get funded, or something theythought customers would want, or something they were told to do bymanagement.  These are smart people; if the technology was good,they\\'d have used it voluntarily.6. It has too many cooks.  The best programming languages have beendeveloped by small groups.  Java seems to be run by a committee.If it turns out to be a good language, it will be the first timein history that a committee has designed a good language.7. It\\'s bureaucratic.  From what little I know about Java, thereseem to be a lot of protocols for doing things.  Really goodlanguages aren\\'t like that.  They let you do what you want and getout of the way.8. It\\'s pseudo-hip.  Sun now pretends that Java is a grassroots,open-source language effort like Perl or Python.  This one justhappens to be controlled by a giant company.  So the language islikely to have the same drab clunkiness as anything else that comesout of a big company.9. It\\'s designed for large organizations.  Large organizations havedifferent aims from hackers. They want languages that are (believedto be) suitable for use by large teams of mediocre programmers--languages with features that, like the speed limiters in U-Haultrucks, prevent fools from doing too much damage.  Hackers don\\'tlike a language that talks down to them.  Hackers just want power.Historically, languages designed for large organizations (PL/I,Ada) have lost, while hacker languages (C, Perl) have won.  Thereason: today\\'s teenage hacker is tomorrow\\'s CTO.10. The wrong people like it.  The programmers I admire most arenot, on the whole, captivated by Java.  Who does like Java?  Suits,who don\\'t know one language from another, but know that they keephearing about Java in the press; programmers at big companies, whoare amazed to find that there is something even better than C++;and plug-and-chug undergrads, who are ready to like anything thatmight get them a job (will this be on the test?).  These people\\'sopinions change with every wind.11. Its daddy is in a pinch.  Sun\\'s business model is being underminedon two fronts.  Cheap Intel processors, of the same type used indesktop machines, are now more than fast enough for servers.  AndFreeBSD seems to be at least as good an OS for servers as Solaris.Sun\\'s advertising implies that you need Sun servers for industrialstrength applications.  If this were true, Yahoo would be first inline to buy Suns;  but when I worked there, the servers were allIntel boxes running FreeBSD.  This bodes ill for Sun\\'s future.  IfSun runs into trouble, they could drag Java down with them.12. The DoD likes it.  The Defense Department is encouragingdevelopers to use Java. This seems to me the most damning sign ofall.  The Defense Department does a fine (though expensive) job ofdefending the country, but they love plans and procedures andprotocols.  Their culture is the opposite of hacker culture; onquestions of software they will tend to bet wrong.  The last timethe DoD really liked a programming language, it was Ada.Bear in mind, this is not a critique of Java, but a critique ofits cover.  I don\\'t know Java well enough to like it or dislikeit.  This is just an explanation of why I don\\'t find that I\\'m eagerto learn it.It may seem cavalier to dismiss a language before you\\'ve even triedwriting programs in it.  But this is something all programmers haveto do.  There are too many technologies out there to learn themall.  You have to learn to judge by outward signs which will beworth your time.  I have likewise cavalierly dismissed Cobol, Ada,Visual Basic, the IBM AS400, VRML, ISO 9000, the SET protocol, VMS,Novell Netware, and CORBA, among others.  They just smelled wrong.It could be that in Java\\'s case I\\'m mistaken.  It could be that alanguage promoted by one big company to undermine another, designedby a committee for a \"mainstream\" audience, hyped to the skies,and beloved of the DoD, happens nonetheless to be a clean, beautiful,powerful language that I would love programming in.  It could be,but it seems very unlikely.Trevor Re: Java\\'s CoverBerners-Lee Re: JavaBeing PopularSun Internal Memo2005: BusinessWeek AgreesJapanese Translation'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Here\\'s a simple trick for getting more people to read what youwrite: write in spoken language.Something comes over most people when they start writing. They writein a different language than they\\'d use if they were talking to afriend. The sentence structure and even the words are different.No one uses \"pen\" as a verb in spoken English. You\\'d feel like anidiot using \"pen\" instead of \"write\" in a conversation with a friend.The last straw for me was a sentence I read a couple days ago:The mercurial Spaniard himself declared: \"After Altamira, all is  decadence.\"It\\'s from Neil Oliver\\'sA History of Ancient Britain. I feel badmaking an example of this book, because it\\'s no worse than lots ofothers.  But just imagine calling Picasso \"the mercurial Spaniard\" whentalking to a friend.  Even onesentence of this would raise eyebrows in conversation.  And yetpeople write whole books of it.Ok, so written and spoken language are different. Does that makewritten language worse?If you want people to read and understand what you write, yes.Written language is more complex, which makes it more work to read.It\\'s also more formal and distant, which gives the reader\\'s attentionpermission to drift.  But perhaps worst of all, the complex sentencesand fancy words give you, the writer, the false impression thatyou\\'re saying more than you actually are.You don\\'t need complex sentences to express complex ideas.  Whenspecialists in some abstruse topic talk to one another about ideasin their field, they don\\'t use sentences any more complex than theydo when talking about what to have for lunch.  They use differentwords, certainly.  But even those they use no more than necessary.And in my experience, the harder the subject, the more informallyexperts speak. Partly, I think, because they have less to prove,and partly because the harder the ideas you\\'re talking about, theless you can afford to let language get in the way.Informal language is the athletic clothing of ideas.I\\'m not saying spoken language always works best. Poetry is as muchmusic as text, so you can say things you wouldn\\'t say in conversation.And there are a handful of writers who can get away with using fancylanguage in prose. And then of course there are cases where writersdon\\'t want to make it easy to understand what they\\'re saying—incorporate announcements of bad news, for example, or at the morebogusend of the humanities.  But for nearly everyone else, spokenlanguage is better.It seems to be hard for most people to write in spoken language.So perhaps the best solution is to write your first draft the wayyou usually would, then afterward look at each sentence and ask \"Isthis the way I\\'d say this if I were talking to a friend?\" If itisn\\'t, imagine what you would say, and use that instead.  After awhile this filter will start to operate as you write. When you writesomething you wouldn\\'t say, you\\'ll hear the clank as it hits thepage.Before I publish a new essay, I read it out loud and fix everythingthat doesn\\'t sound like conversation. I even fix bits that arephonetically awkward; I don\\'t know if that\\'s necessary, but itdoesn\\'t cost much.This trick may not always be enough.  I\\'ve seen writing so farremoved from spoken language that it couldn\\'t be fixed sentence bysentence.  For cases like that there\\'s a more drastic solution.After writing the first draft, try explaining to a friend what youjust wrote. Then replace the draft with what you said to your friend.People often tell me how much my essays sound like me talking.The fact that this seems worthy of comment shows how rarely peoplemanage to write in spoken language.  Otherwise everyone\\'s writingwould sound like them talking.If you simply manage to write in spoken language, you\\'ll be aheadof 95% of writers.  And it\\'s so easy to do: just don\\'t let a sentencethrough unless it\\'s the way you\\'d say it to a friend.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'One of the most valuable exercises you can try if you want tounderstand startups is to look at the most successful companies andexplain why they were not as lame as they seemed when they firstlaunched.  Because they practically all seemed lame at first. Notjust small, lame.  Not just the first step up a big mountain.  Morelike the first step into a swamp.A Basic interpreter for the Altair?  How could that ever grow intoa giant company?  People sleeping on airbeds in strangers\\' apartments?A web site for college students to stalk one another?  A wimpylittle single-board computer for hobbyists that used a TV as amonitor?  A new search engine, when there were already about 10,and they were all trying to de-emphasize search?  These ideas didn\\'tjust seem small.  They seemed wrong.  They were the kind of ideasyou could not merely ignore, but ridicule.Often the founders themselves didn\\'t know why their ideas werepromising.  They were attracted to these ideas by instinct, becausethey wereliving in the futureandthey sensed that something was missing.  But they could not haveput into words exactly how their ugly ducklings were going to growinto big, beautiful swans.Most people\\'s first impulse when they hear about a lame-soundingnew startup idea is to make fun of it.

       "  'date': 'Want to start a startup?',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.July 2009Now that the term \"ramen profitable\" has become widespread, I oughtto explain precisely what the idea entails.Ramen profitable means a startup makes just enough to pay thefounders\\' living expenses.  This is a different form of profitabilitythan startups have traditionally aimed for.  Traditional profitabilitymeans a big bet is finally paying off, whereas the main importanceof ramen profitability is that it buys you time.In the past, a startup would usually become profitable onlyafter raising and spending quite a lot of money.  A company makingcomputer hardware might not become profitable for 5 years, duringwhich they spent $50 million.  But when they didthey might have revenues of $50 million a year.   This kind ofprofitability means the startup has succeeded.Ramen profitability is the other extreme: a startup that becomesprofitable after 2 months, even though its revenues are only $3000a month, because the only employees are a couple 25 year old founderswho can live on practically nothing.  Revenues of $3000 a month donot mean the company has succeeded.But it does share something with the onethat\\'s profitable in the traditional way: they don\\'t need to raisemoney to survive.Ramen profitability is an unfamiliar idea to most people becauseit only recently became feasible.  It\\'s still not feasible for alot of startups; it would not be for most biotech startups, forexample; but it is for many software startups because they\\'re nowso cheap.  For many, the only real cost is the founders\\'living expenses.The main significance of this type of profitability is that you\\'reno longer at the mercy of investors.  If you\\'re still losing money,then eventually you\\'ll either have to raise moreor shut down.  Once you\\'reramen profitable this painful choice goes away.You can still raise money, but you don\\'t have to do it now.* * *The most obvious advantage of not needing money is thatyou can get better terms.  If investors know you need money, they\\'llsometimes take advantage of you.  Some may even deliberatelystall, because they know that as you run out of money you\\'ll becomeincreasingly pliable.But there are also three less obvious advantages of ramen profitability.One is that it makes you more attractive to investors.  If you\\'realready profitable, on however small a scale, it shows that (a) youcan get at least someone to pay you, (b) you\\'re serious aboutbuilding things people want, and (c) you\\'re disciplined enough tokeep expenses low.This is reassuring to investors, because you\\'ve addressed three oftheir biggest worries.  It\\'s common for them to fund companies thathave smart founders and a big market, and yet still fail.  Whenthese companies fail, it\\'s usually because (a) people wouldn\\'t payfor what they made, e.g. because it was too hard to sell to them,or the market wasn\\'t ready yet, (b) the founders solved the wrongproblem, instead of paying attention to what users needed, or (c)the company spent too much and burned through their funding beforethey started to make money.  If you\\'re ramen profitable, you\\'realready avoiding these mistakes.Another advantage of ramen profitability is that it\\'s good formorale.  A companytends to feel rather theoretical when you first start it.  It\\'slegally a company, but you feel like you\\'re lying when you call itone.  When people start to pay you significant amounts, the companystarts to feel real.  And your own living expenses are the milestoneyou feel most, because at that point the future flips state.  Nowsurvival is the default, instead of dying.A morale boost on that scale is very valuable in a startup, becausethe moral weight of running a startup is what makes it hard.  Startupsare still very rare.  Why don\\'t more people do it?  The financialrisk?  Plenty of 25 year olds save nothing anyway.  The long hours?Plenty of people work just as long hours in regular jobs. What keepspeople from starting startups is the fear of having so muchresponsibility.  And this is not an irrational fear: it really ishard to bear.  Anything that takes some of that weight off you will greatly increase your chances of surviving.A startup that reaches ramen profitability may be more likelyto succeed than not.  Which is pretty exciting, considering thebimodal distribution of outcomes in startups: you either fail ormake a lot of money.The fourth advantage of ramen profitability is the least obviousbut may be the most important.  If you don\\'t need to raise money,you don\\'t have to interrupt working on the company to do it.Raising moneyis terribly distracting.  You\\'re lucky if yourproductivity is a third of what it was before.  And it can last formonths.I didn\\'t understand (or rather, remember) precisely why raisingmoney was so distracting till earlier this year.  I\\'d noticed thatstartups we funded would usually grind to a halt when they switchedto raising money, but I didn\\'t remember exactly why till YC raisedmoney itself.  We had a comparatively easy time of it; the firstpeople I asked said yes; but it took months to work out thedetails, and during that time I got hardly any real work done.  Why?Because I thought about it all the time.At any given time there tends to be one problem that\\'s the mosturgent for a startup.  This is what you think about as you fallasleep at night and when you take a shower in the morning.  Andwhen you start raising money, that becomes the problem you thinkabout.  You only take one shower in the morning, and if you\\'rethinking about investors during it, then you\\'re not thinking aboutthe product.Whereas if you can choose when you raise money, you can pick a timewhen you\\'re not in the middle of something else, and you can probablyalso insist that the round close fast.  You may even be able toavoid having the round occupy your thoughts, if you don\\'t carewhether it closes.* * *Ramen profitable means no more than the definition implies.  Itdoes not, for example, imply that you\\'re \"bootstrapping\" thestartup—that you\\'re never going to take money from investors.Empirically that doesn\\'t seem to work very well.  Few startupssucceed without taking investment.  Maybe as startups get cheaperit will become more common.  On the other hand, the money is there,waiting to be invested.  If startups need it less, they\\'ll be ableto get it on better terms, which will make them more inclined totake it.  That will tend to produce an equilibrium.Another thing ramen profitability doesn\\'t imply is Joe Kraus\\'s ideathat you should put yourbusiness modelin beta when you put yourproduct in beta.  He believes you should getpeople to pay you from the beginning.  I think that\\'s too constraining.Facebook didn\\'t, and they\\'ve done better than most startups.  Makingmoney right away was not only unnecessary for them, but probablywould have been harmful.  I do think Joe\\'s rule could be useful formany startups, though.  When founders seem unfocused, I sometimessuggest they try to get customers to pay them for something, in thehope that this constraint will prod them into action.The difference between Joe\\'s idea and ramen profitability is thata ramen profitable company doesn\\'t have to be making money the wayit ultimately will.  It just has to be making money.  The mostfamous example is Google, which initially made money by licensingsearch to sites like Yahoo.Is there a downside to ramen profitability?  Probably the biggestdanger is that it might turn you into a consulting firm.  Startupshave to be product companies, in the sense of making a single thingthat everyone uses.  The defining quality of startups is that theygrow fast, and consulting just can\\'t scale the way a product can.But it\\'s pretty easy to make $3000 a month consulting; infact, that would be a low rate for contract programming.  So therecould be a temptation to slide into consulting, and tellingyourselves you\\'re a ramen profitable startup, when in factyou\\'re not a startup at all.It\\'s ok to do a little consulting-type work at first.  Startupsusually have to do something weird at first.  But rememberthat ramen profitability is not the destination.  A startup\\'sdestination is to grow really big; ramen profitability is a trickfornot dyingen route.'},\n",

I know of zero instances in which he has behavedbadly.  It\\'s hard even to imagine.When I first came to Silicon Valley I thought \"How lucky that someoneso powerful is so benevolent.\"  But gradually I realized it wasn\\'tluck.  It was by being benevolent that Ronco became so powerful.All the deals he gets to invest in come to him through referrals.Google did. Facebook did. Twitter was a referral from Evan Williamshimself.  And the reason so many people refer deals to him is thathe\\'s proven himself to be a good guy.Good does not mean being a pushover.  I would not want to face anangry Ronco.  But if Ron\\'s angry at you, it\\'s because you didsomething wrong.  Ron is so old school he\\'s Old Testament.  He willsmite you in his just wrath, but there\\'s no malice in it.In almost every domain there are advantages to seeming good.  Itmakes people trust you.  But actually being good is an expensiveway to seem good.  To an amoral person it might seem to be overkill.In some fields it might be, but apparently not in the startup world.Though plenty of investors are jerks, there is a clear trend amongthem: the most successful investors are also the most upstanding.It was not always this way.  I would not feel confident saying thatabout investors twenty years ago.What changed?  The startup world became more transparent and moreunpredictable.  Both make it harder to seem good without actuallybeing good.It\\'s obvious why transparency has that effect.  When an investormaltreats a founder now, it gets out.  Maybe not all the way to thepress, but other founders hear about it, and that investorstarts to lose deals.The effect of unpredictability is more subtle.  It increases thework of being inconsistent.  If you\\'re going to be two-faced, youhave to know who you should be nice to and who you can get awaywith being nasty to.  In the startup world, things change so rapidlythat you can\\'t tell.  The random college kid you talk to today mightin a couple years be the CEO of the hottest startup in the Valley.If you can\\'t tell who to be nice to, you have to be nice to everyone.And probably the only people who can manage that are the people whoare genuinely good.In a sufficiently connected and unpredictable world, you can\\'t seemgood without being good.As often happens, Ron discovered how to be the investor of thefuture by accident.  He didn\\'t foresee the future of startupinvesting, realize it would pay to be upstanding, and force himselfto behave that way. It would feel unnatural to him to behave anyother way.  He was alreadyliving in the future.Fortunately that future is not limited to the startup world.

       "  'essay_text': 'When I was in high school I spent a lot of time imitating badwriters.  What we studied in English classes was mostly fiction,so I assumed that was the highest form of writing.  Mistake numberone.  The stories that seemed to be most admired were ones in whichpeople suffered in complicated ways.  Anything funny orgripping was ipso facto suspect, unless it was old enough to be hard tounderstand, like Shakespeare or Chaucer.  Mistake number two.  Theideal medium seemed the short story, which I\\'ve since learned hadquite a brief life, roughly coincident with the peak of magazinepublishing.  But since their size made them perfect for use inhigh school classes, we read a lot of them, which gave us theimpression the short story was flourishing.  Mistake number three.And because they were so short, nothing really had to happen; youcould just show a randomly truncated slice of life, and that wasconsidered advanced.  Mistake number four.  The result was that Iwrote a lot of stories in which nothing happened except that someonewas unhappy in a way that seemed deep.For most of college I was a philosophy major.  I was very impressedby the papers published in philosophy journals.  They were sobeautifully typeset, and their tone was just captivating—alternatelycasual and buffer-overflowingly technical.  A fellow would be walkingalong a street and suddenly modality qua modality would spring uponhim.  I didn\\'t ever quite understand these papers, but I figuredI\\'d get around to that later, when I had time to reread them moreclosely.  In the meantime I tried my best to imitate them.  Thiswas, I can now see, a doomed undertaking, because they weren\\'treally saying anything.  No philosopher ever refuted another, forexample, because no one said anything definite enough to refute.Needless to say, my imitations didn\\'t say anything either.In grad school I was still wasting time imitating the wrong things.There was then a fashionable type of program called an expert system,at the core of which was something called an inference engine.  Ilooked at what these things did and thought \"I could write that ina thousand lines of code.\"  And yet eminent professors were writingbooks about them, and startups were selling them for a year\\'s salarya copy.  What an opportunity, I thought; these impressive thingsseem easy to me; I must be pretty sharp.  Wrong.  It was simply afad.  The books the professors wrote about expert systems are nowignored.  They were not even on apathto anything interesting.And the customers paying so much for them were largely the samegovernment agencies that paid thousands for screwdrivers and toiletseats.How do you avoid copying the wrong things?  Copy only what yougenuinely like.  That would have saved me in all three cases.  Ididn\\'t enjoy the short stories we had to read in English classes;I didn\\'t learn anything from philosophy papers; I didn\\'t use expertsystems myself.  I believed these things were good because theywere admired.It can be hard to separate the things you like from the thingsyou\\'re impressed with.  One trick is to ignore presentation.  WheneverI see a painting impressively hung in a museum, I ask myself: howmuch would I pay for this if I found it at a garage sale, dirty andframeless, and with no idea who painted it?  If you walk around amuseum trying this experiment, you\\'ll find you get some trulystartling results.  Don\\'t ignore this data point just because it\\'san outlier.Another way to figure out what you like is to look at what you enjoyas guilty pleasures.  Many things people like, especially if they\\'reyoung and ambitious, they like largely for the feeling of virtuein liking them.  99% of people readingUlyssesare thinking\"I\\'m readingUlysses\" as they do it. A guilty pleasure isat least a pure one.  What do you read when you don\\'t feel up to beingvirtuous?  What kind of book do you read and feel sad that there\\'sonly half of it left, instead of being impressed that you\\'re halfway through?  That\\'s what you really like.Even when you find genuinely good things to copy, there\\'s anotherpitfall to be avoided.  Be careful to copy what makes them good,rather than their flaws.  It\\'s easy to be drawn into imitatingflaws, because they\\'re easier to see, and of course easier to copytoo.  For example, most painters in the eighteenth and nineteenthcenturies used brownish colors.  They were imitating the greatpainters of the Renaissance, whose paintings by that time were brownwith dirt.  Those paintings have since been cleaned, revealingbrilliant colors; their imitators are of course still brown.It was painting, incidentally, that cured me of copying the wrongthings.  Halfway through grad school I decided I wanted to try beinga painter, and the art world was so manifestly corrupt that itsnapped the leash of credulity.

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.July 2013One of the most common types of advice we give at Y Combinator isto do things that don\\'t scale.  A lot of would-be founders believethat startups either take off or don\\'t.  You build something, makeit available, and if you\\'ve made a better mousetrap, people beat apath to your door as promised.  Or they don\\'t, in which case themarket must not exist.Actually startups take off because the founders make them take off.There may be a handful that just grew by themselves, but usuallyit takes some sort of push to get them going.  A good metaphor wouldbe the cranks that car engines had before they got electric starters.Once the engine was going, it would keep going, but there was aseparate and laborious process to get it going.RecruitThe most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the startis to recruit users manually.  Nearly all startups have to.  Youcan\\'t wait for users to come to you.  You have to go out and getthem.Stripe is one of the most successful startups we\\'ve funded, and theproblem they solved was an urgent one.   If anyone could have satback and waited for users, it was Stripe.  But in fact they\\'refamous within YC for aggressive early user acquisition.Startups building things for other startups have a big pool ofpotential users in the other companies we\\'ve funded, and none tookbetter advantage of it than Stripe.  At YC we use the term \"Collisoninstallation\" for the technique they invented.  More diffidentfounders ask \"Will you try our beta?\" and if the answer is yes,they say \"Great, we\\'ll send you a link.\"  But the Collison brothersweren\\'t going to wait. When anyone agreed to try Stripe they\\'d say\"Right then, give me your laptop\" and set them up on the spot.There are two reasons founders resist going out and recruiting usersindividually.  One is a combination of shyness and laziness.  They\\'drather sit at home writing code than go out and talk to a bunch ofstrangers and probably be rejected by most of them.  But for astartup to succeed, at least one founder (usually the CEO) willhave to spend a lot of time on sales and marketing.The other reason founders ignore this path is that the absolutenumbers seem so small at first.  This can\\'t be how the big, famousstartups got started, they think. The mistake they make is tounderestimate the power of compound growth.  We encourage everystartup to measure their progress by weeklygrowthrate.  If you have 100 users, you need to get 10 more next weekto grow 10% a week.  And while 110 may not seem much better than100, if you keep growing at 10% a week you\\'ll be surprised how bigthe numbers get.  After a year you\\'ll have 14,000 users, and after2 years you\\'ll have 2 million.You\\'ll be doing different things when you\\'re acquiring users athousand at a time, and growth has to slow down eventually.  Butif the market exists you can usually start by recruiting usersmanually and then gradually switch to less manual methods.Airbnb is a classic example of this technique.  Marketplaces areso hard to get rolling that you should expect to take heroic measuresat first. In Airbnb\\'s case, these consisted of going door to doorin New York, recruiting new users and helping existing ones improvetheir listings.  When I remember the Airbnbs during YC, I picturethem with rolly bags, because when they showed up for tuesday dinnersthey\\'d always just flown back from somewhere.FragileAirbnb now seems like an unstoppable juggernaut, but early on itwas so fragile that about 30 days of going out and engaging inperson with users made the difference between success and failure.That initial fragility was not a unique feature of Airbnb.  Almostall startups are fragile initially.  And that\\'s one of the biggestthings inexperienced founders and investors (and reporters andknow-it-alls on forums) get wrong about them.  They unconsciouslyjudge larval startups by the standards of established ones.  They\\'relike someone looking at a newborn baby and concluding \"there\\'s noway this tiny creature could ever accomplish anything.\"It\\'s harmless if reporters and know-it-alls dismiss your startup.They always get things wrong.   It\\'s even ok if investors dismissyour startup; they\\'ll change their minds when they see growth.  Thebig danger is that you\\'ll dismiss your startup yourself.  I\\'ve seenit happen.  I often have to encourage founders who don\\'t see thefull potential of what they\\'re building.  Even Bill Gates made thatmistake.  He returned to Harvard for the fall semester after startingMicrosoft.  He didn\\'t stay long, but he wouldn\\'t have returned atall if he\\'d realized Microsoft was going to be even a fraction ofthe size it turned out to be.The question to ask about an early stage startup is not \"is thiscompany taking over the world?\"  but \"how big could this companyget if the founders did the right things?\"  And the right thingsoften seem both laborious and inconsequential at the time. Microsoftcan\\'t have seemed very impressive when it was just a couple guysin Albuquerque writing Basic interpreters for a market of a fewthousand hobbyists (as they were then called), but in retrospectthat was the optimal path to dominating microcomputer software.And I know Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia didn\\'t feel like they wereen route to the big time as they were taking \"professional\" photosof their first hosts\\' apartments.  They were just trying to survive.But in retrospect that too was the optimal path to dominating a bigmarket.How do you find users to recruit manually?  If you build somethingto solveyour own problems, thenyou only have to find your peers, which is usually straightforward.Otherwise you\\'ll have to make a more deliberate effort to locatethe most promising vein of users.  The usual way to do that is toget some initial set of users by doing a comparatively untargetedlaunch, and then to observe which kind seem most enthusiastic, andseek out more like them.  For example, Ben Silbermann noticed thata lot of the earliest Pinterest users were interested in design,so he went to a conference of design bloggers to recruit users, andthat worked well.DelightYou should take extraordinary measures not just to acquire users,but also to make them happy.  For as long as they could (whichturned out to be surprisingly long), Wufoo sent each new user ahand-written thank you note.  Your first users should feel thatsigning up with you was one of the best choices they ever made.And you in turn should be racking your brains to think of new waysto delight them.Why do we have to teach startups this?  Why is it counterintuitivefor founders?  Three reasons, I think.One is that a lot of startup founders are trained as engineers,and customer service is not part of the training of engineers.You\\'re supposed to build things that are robust and elegant, notbe slavishly attentive to individual users like some kind ofsalesperson.  Ironically, part of the reason engineering istraditionally averse to handholding is that its traditions datefrom a time when engineers were less powerful — when they wereonly in charge of their narrow domain of building things, ratherthan running the whole show.  You can be ornery when you\\'re Scotty,but not when you\\'re Kirk.Another reason founders don\\'t focus enough on individual customersis that they worry it won\\'t scale.  But when founders of larvalstartups worry about this, I point out that in their current statethey have nothing to lose.  Maybe if they go out of their way tomake existing users super happy, they\\'ll one day have too many todo so much for.  That would be a great problem to have.  See if youcan make it happen.  And incidentally, when it does, you\\'ll findthat delighting customers scales better than you expected.  Partlybecause you can usually find ways to make anything scale more thanyou would have predicted, and partly because delighting customerswill by then have permeated your culture.I have never once seen a startup lured down a blind alley by tryingtoo hard to make their initial users happy.But perhaps the biggest thing preventing founders from realizinghow attentive they could be to their users is that they\\'ve neverexperienced such attention themselves.  Their standards for customerservice have been set by the companies they\\'ve been customers of,which are mostly big ones.  Tim Cook doesn\\'t send you a hand-writtennote after you buy a laptop.  He can\\'t.  But you can.  That\\'s oneadvantage of being small: you can provide a level of service no bigcompany can.Once you realize that existing conventions are not the upper boundon user experience, it\\'s interesting in a very pleasant way to thinkabout how far you could go to delight your users.ExperienceI was trying to think of a phrase to convey how extreme your attentionto users should be, and I realized Steve Jobs had already done it:insanely great.  Steve wasn\\'t just using \"insanely\" as a synonymfor \"very.\"  He meant it more literally — that one should focuson quality of execution to a degree that in everyday life would beconsidered pathological.All the most successful startups we\\'ve funded have, and that probablydoesn\\'t surprise would-be founders.  What novice founders don\\'t getis what insanely great translates to in a larval startup.  WhenSteve Jobs started using that phrase, Apple was already an establishedcompany.  He meant the Mac (and its documentation and evenpackaging — such is the nature of obsession) should be insanelywell designed and manufactured.  That\\'s not hard for engineers tograsp.  It\\'s just a more extreme version of designing a robust andelegant product.What founders have a hard time grasping (and Steve himself mighthave had a hard time grasping) is what insanely great morphs intoas you roll the time slider back to the first couple months of astartup\\'s life.  It\\'s not the product that should be insanely great,but the experience of being your user.  The product is just onecomponent of that.  For a big company it\\'s necessarily the dominantone.  But you can and should give users an insanely great experiencewith an early, incomplete, buggy product, if you make up thedifference with attentiveness.Can, perhaps, but should?  Yes.  Over-engaging with early users isnot just a permissible technique for getting growth rolling.  Formost successful startups it\\'s a necessary part of the feedback loopthat makes the product good.  Making a better mousetrap is not anatomic operation.  Even if you start the way most successful startupshave, by building something you yourself need, the first thing youbuild is never quite right.  And except in domains with big penaltiesfor making mistakes, it\\'s often better not to aim for perfectioninitially.  In software, especially, it usually works best to getsomething in front of users as soon as it has a quantum of utility,and then see what they do with it.  Perfectionism is often an excusefor procrastination, and in any case your initial model of usersis always inaccurate, even if you\\'re one of them.The feedback you get from engaging directly with your earliest userswill be the best you ever get.  When you\\'re so big you have toresort to focus groups, you\\'ll wish you could go over to your users\\'homes and offices and watch them use your stuff like you did whenthere were only a handful of them.FireSometimes the right unscalable trick is to focus on a deliberatelynarrow market.  It\\'s like keeping a fire contained at first to getit really hot before adding more logs.That\\'s what Facebook did.  At first it was just for Harvard students.In that form it only had a potential market of a few thousand people,but because they felt it was really for them, a critical mass ofthem signed up.  After Facebook stopped being for Harvard students,it remained for students at specific colleges for quite a while.When I interviewed Mark Zuckerberg at Startup School, he said thatwhile it was a lot of work creating course lists for each school,doing that made students feel the site was their natural home.Any startup that could be described as a marketplace usually hasto start in a subset of the market, but this can work for otherstartups as well.  It\\'s always worth asking if there\\'s a subset ofthe market in which you can get a critical mass of users quickly.Most startups that use the contained fire strategy do it unconsciously.They build something for themselves and their friends, who happento be the early adopters, and only realize later that they couldoffer it to a broader market.  The strategy works just as well ifyou do it unconsciously.  The biggest danger of not being consciouslyaware of this pattern is for those who naively discard part of it.E.g. if you don\\'t build something for yourself and your friends,or even if you do, but you come from the corporate world and yourfriends are not early adopters, you\\'ll no longer have a perfectinitial market handed to you on a platter.Among companies, the best early adopters are usually other startups.They\\'re more open to new things both by nature and because, havingjust been started, they haven\\'t made all their choices yet.  Pluswhen they succeed they grow fast, and you with them.  It was oneof many unforeseen advantages of the YC model (and specifically ofmaking YC big) that B2B startups now have an instant market ofhundreds of other startups ready at hand.MerakiForhardware startupsthere\\'s a variant ofdoing things that don\\'t scale that we call \"pulling a Meraki.\"Although we didn\\'t fund Meraki, the founders were Robert Morris\\'sgrad students, so we know their history.  They got started by doingsomething that really doesn\\'t scale: assembling their routersthemselves.Hardware startups face an obstacle that software startups don\\'t.The minimum order for a factory production run is usually severalhundred thousand dollars.  Which can put you in a catch-22: withouta product you can\\'t generate the growth you need to raise the moneyto manufacture your product.  Back when hardware startups had torely on investors for money, you had to be pretty convincing toovercome this.  The arrival of crowdfunding (or more precisely,preorders) has helped a lot.  But even so I\\'d advise startups topull a Meraki initially if they can.  That\\'s what Pebble did.  ThePebblesassembledthe first several hundred watches themselves. Ifthey hadn\\'t gone through that phase, they probably wouldn\\'t havesold $10 million worth of watches when they did go on Kickstarter.Like paying excessive attention to early customers, fabricatingthings yourself turns out to be valuable for hardware startups.You can tweak the design faster when you\\'re the factory, and youlearn things you\\'d never have known otherwise.  Eric Migicovsky ofPebble said one of the things he learned was \"how valuable it was tosource good screws.\"   Who knew?ConsultSometimes we advise founders of B2B startups to take over-engagementto an extreme, and to pick a single user and act as if they wereconsultants building something just for that one user.   The initialuser serves as the form for your mold; keep tweaking till you fittheir needs perfectly, and you\\'ll usually find you\\'ve made somethingother users want too.  Even if there aren\\'t many of them, there areprobably adjacent territories that have more.  As long as you canfind just one user who really needs something and can act on thatneed, you\\'ve got a toehold in making something people want, andthat\\'s as much as any startup needs initially.Consulting is the canonical example of work that doesn\\'t scale.But (like other ways of bestowing one\\'s favors liberally) it\\'s safeto do it so long as you\\'re not being paid to.  That\\'s where companiescross the line.  So long as you\\'re a product company that\\'s merelybeing extra attentive to a customer, they\\'re very grateful even ifyou don\\'t solve all their problems.  But when they start paying youspecifically for that attentiveness — when they start payingyou by the hour — they expect you to do everything.Another consulting-like technique for recruiting initially lukewarmusers is to use your software yourselves on their behalf.  Wedid that at Viaweb.  When we approached merchants asking if theywanted to use our software to make online stores, some said no, butthey\\'d let us make one for them.  Since we would do anything to getusers, we did.  We felt pretty lame at the time.  Instead oforganizing big strategic e-commerce partnerships, we were tryingto sell luggage and pens and men\\'s shirts.  But in retrospect itwas exactly the right thing to do, because it taught us how it wouldfeel to merchants to use our software.  Sometimes the feedback loopwas near instantaneous: in the middle of building some merchant\\'ssite I\\'d find I needed a feature we didn\\'t have, so I\\'d spend acouple hours implementing it and then resume building the site.ManualThere\\'s a more extreme variant where you don\\'t just use your software,but are your software.  When you only have a small number of users,you can sometimes get away with doing by hand things that you planto automate later.  This lets you launch faster, and when you dofinally automate yourself out of the loop, you\\'ll know exactly whatto build because you\\'ll have muscle memory from doing it yourself.When manual components look to the user like software, this techniquestarts to have aspects of a practical joke.  For example, the wayStripe delivered \"instant\" merchant accounts to its first users wasthat the founders manually signed them up for traditional merchantaccounts behind the scenes.Some startups could be entirely manual at first. If you can findsomeone with a problem that needs solving and you can solve itmanually, go ahead and do that for as long as you can, and thengradually automate the bottlenecks.  It would be a little frighteningto be solving users\\' problems in a way that wasn\\'t yet automatic,but less frightening than the far more common case of having somethingautomatic that doesn\\'t yet solve anyone\\'s problems.BigI should mention one sort of initial tactic that usually doesn\\'twork: the Big Launch.  I occasionally meet founders who seem tobelieve startups are projectiles rather than powered aircraft, andthat they\\'ll make it big if and only if they\\'re launched withsufficient initial velocity.  They want to launch simultaneouslyin 8 different publications, with embargoes.  And on a tuesday, ofcourse, since they read somewhere that\\'s the optimum day to launchsomething.It\\'s easy to see how little launches matter.  Think of some successfulstartups.  How many of their launches do you remember?All you need from a launch is some initial core of users.  How wellyou\\'re doing a few months later will depend more on how happy youmade those users than how many there were of them.So why do founders think launches matter?  A combination of solipsismand laziness.  They think what they\\'re building is so great thateveryone who hears about it will immediately sign up.  Plus it wouldbe so much less work if you could get users merely by broadcastingyour existence, rather than recruiting them one at a time.  Buteven if what you\\'re building really is great, getting users willalways be a gradual process — partly because great thingsare usually also novel, but mainly because users have other thingsto think about.Partnerships too usually don\\'t work.  They don\\'t work for startupsin general, but they especially don\\'t work as a way to get growthstarted.  It\\'s a common mistake among inexperienced founders tobelieve that a partnership with a big company will be their bigbreak.  Six months later they\\'re all saying the same thing: thatwas way more work than we expected, and we ended up getting practicallynothing out of it.It\\'s not enough just to do something extraordinary initially.  Youhave to make an extraordinaryeffortinitially.  Any strategythat omits the effort — whether it\\'s expecting a big launch toget you users, or a big partner — is ipso facto suspect.VectorThe need to do something unscalably laborious to get started is sonearly universal that it might be a good idea to stop thinking ofstartup ideas as scalars.  Instead we should try thinking of themas pairs of what you\\'re going to build, plus the unscalable thing(s)you\\'re going to do initially to get the company going.It could be interesting to start viewing startup ideas this way,because now that there are two components you can try to be imaginativeabout the second as well as the first.  But in most cases the secondcomponent will be what it usually is — recruit users manuallyand give them an overwhelmingly good experience — and the mainbenefit of treating startups as vectors will be to remind foundersthey need to work hard in two dimensions.In the best case, both components of the vector contribute to yourcompany\\'s DNA: the unscalable things you have to do to get startedare not merely a necessary evil, but change the company permanentlyfor the better.  If you have to be aggressive about user acquisitionwhen you\\'re small, you\\'ll probably still be aggressive when you\\'rebig.  If you have to manufacture your own hardware, or use yoursoftware on users\\'s behalf, you\\'ll learn things you couldn\\'t havelearned otherwise.  And most importantly, if you have to work hardto delight users when you only have a handful of them, you\\'ll keepdoing it when you have a lot.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.October 2007(This essay is derived from a keynote at FOWA in October 2007.)There\\'s something interesting happening right now.  Startups areundergoing the same transformation that technology does when it becomescheaper.It\\'s a pattern we see over and over in technology.  Initiallythere\\'s some device that\\'s very expensive and madein small quantities.  Then someone discovers how to make them cheaply; many more get built; and as a result they can be used in new ways.Computers are a familiar example.  When I was a kid, computers werebig, expensive machines built one at a time.  Now they\\'re a commodity.Now we can stick computers in everything.This pattern is very old.  Most of the turningpoints in economic history are instances of it.  It happened tosteel in the 1850s, and to power in the 1780s.It happened to cloth manufacture in the thirteenth century, generatingthe wealth that later brought about the Renaissance.  Agricultureitself was an instance of this pattern.Now as well as being produced by startups, this patternis happeningtostartups.  It\\'s so cheap to start web startupsthat orders of magnitudes more will be started.   If the patternholds true, that should cause dramatic changes.1. Lots of StartupsSo my first prediction about the future of web startups is prettystraightforward: there will be a lot of them.  When starting astartup was expensive, you had to get the permission of investorsto do it.  Now the only threshold is courage.Even that threshold is getting lower, as people watch others takethe plunge and survive.  In the last batch of startups we funded,we had several founders who said they\\'d thought of applying before,but weren\\'t sure and got jobs instead.  It was only after hearingreports of friends who\\'d done it that they decided to try itthemselves.Starting a startup is hard, but having a 9 to 5 job is hard too,and in some ways a worse kind of hard.  In a startup you have lotsof worries, but you don\\'t have that feeling that your life is flyingby like you do in a big company.  Plus in a startup you could makemuch more money.As word spreads that startups work, the number may growto a point that would now seem surprising.We now think of it as normal to have a job at a company, but thisis the thinnest of historical veneers.  Just two or threelifetimes ago, most people in what are now called industrializedcountries lived by farming.  So while it may seem surprising topropose that large numbers of people will change the way they makea living, it would be more surprising if they didn\\'t.2. StandardizationWhen technology makes something dramatically cheaper, standardizationalways follows.  When you make things in large volumes you tendto standardize everything that doesn\\'t need to change.At Y Combinator we still only have four people, so we try tostandardize everything.  We could hire employees, but we want to beforced to figure out how to scale investing.We often tell startups to release a minimal version one quickly, then let the needs of the users determine what to donext.  In essense, let the market design the product.  We\\'vedone the same thing ourselves.  We think of the techniques we\\'redeveloping for dealing with large numbers of startups as likesoftware.  Sometimes it literally is software, likeHacker Newsandour application system.One of the most important things we\\'ve been working on standardizingare investment terms.  Till now investment terms have beenindividually negotiated.This is a problem for founders, because it makes raising moneytake longer and cost more in legal fees.  So as well as using thesame paperwork for every deal we do, we\\'ve commissioned genericangel paperwork that all the startups we fund can use for futurerounds.Some investors will still want to cook up their own deal terms.Series A rounds, where you raise a million dollars or more, willbe custom deals for the forseeable future.  But I think angel roundswill start to be done mostly with standardized agreements.  An angelwho wants to insert a bunch of complicated terms into the agreementis probably not one you want anyway.3. New Attitude to AcquisitionAnother thing I see starting to get standardized is acquisitions.As the volume of startups increases, big companies will start todevelop standardized procedures that make acquisitions littlemore work than hiring someone.Google is the leader here, as in so many areas of technology.  Theybuy a lot of startups— more than most people realize, because theyonly announce a fraction of them.   And being Google, they\\'refiguring out how to do it efficiently.One problem they\\'ve solved is how to think about acquisitions.  Formost companies, acquisitions still carry some stigma of inadequacy.Companies do them because they have to, but there\\'s usually somefeeling they shouldn\\'t have to—that their own programmers shouldbe able to build everything they need.Google\\'s example should cure the rest of the world of this idea.Google has by far the best programmers of any public technologycompany.  If they don\\'t have a problem doing acquisitions, theothers should have even less problem.  However many Google does,Microsoft should do ten times as many.One reason Google doesn\\'t have a problem with acquisitionsis that they know first-hand the quality of the people they can getthat way.  Larry and Sergey only started Google after making therounds of the search engines trying to sell their idea and findingno takers.  They\\'vebeenthe guys coming in to visit the bigcompany, so they know who might be sitting across that conferencetable from them.4. Riskier Strategies are PossibleRisk is always proportionate to reward.  The way to get really bigreturns is to do things that seem crazy, like starting a new searchengine in 1998, or turning down a billion dollar acquisition offer.This has traditionally been a problem in venture funding.  Foundersand investors have different attitudes to risk.  Knowing that riskis on average proportionate to reward, investors like risky strategies,while founders, who don\\'t have a big enough sample size to carewhat\\'s true on average, tend to be more conservative.If startups are easy to start, this conflict goes away, becausefounders can start them younger, when it\\'s rational to take morerisk, and can start more startups total in their careers.  Whenfounders can do lots of startups, they can start to look at theworld in the same portfolio-optimizing way as investors.  And thatmeans the overall amount of wealth created can be greater, becausestrategies can be riskier.5. Younger, Nerdier FoundersIf startups become a cheap commodity, more people will be able tohave them, just as more people could have computers once microprocessorsmade them cheap.  And in particular, younger and more technicalfounders will be able to start startups than could before.Back when it cost a lot to start a startup, you had to convinceinvestors to let you do it.  And that required very different skillsfrom actually doing the startup.  If investors were perfect judges,the two would require exactly the same skills.  But unfortunatelymost investors are terrible judges.  I know because I see behindthe scenes what an enormous amount of work it takes to raise money,and the amount of selling required in an industry is always inverselyproportional to the judgement of the buyers.Fortunately, if startups get cheaper to start, there\\'s another wayto convince investors.  Instead of going to venture capitalistswith a business plan and trying to convince them to fund it, youcan get a product launched on a few tens of thousands of dollarsof seed money from us or your uncle, and approach them with aworking company instead of a plan for one.  Then instead ofhaving to seem smooth and confident, you can just point them toAlexa.This way of convincing investors is better suited to hackers, whooften went into technology in part because they felt uncomfortablewith the amount of fakeness required in other fields.6. Startup Hubs Will PersistIt might seem that if startups get cheap to start, it will mean theend of startup hubs like Silicon Valley.  If all you need to starta startup is rent money, you should be able to do it anywhere.This is kind of true and kind of false.  It\\'s true that you can nowstarta startup anywhere.  But you have to do more with astartup than just start it.  You have to make it succeed.  And thatis more likely to happen in a startup hub.I\\'ve thought a lot about this question, and it seems to me theincreasing cheapness of web startups will if anything increase theimportance of startup hubs.  The value of startup hubs, like centersfor any kind of business, lies in something very old-fashioned:face to face meetings.  No technology in the immediate future willreplace walking down University Ave and running into a friend whotells you how to fix a bug that\\'s been bothering you all weekend,or visiting a friend\\'s startup down the street and ending up in aconversation with one of their investors.The question of whether to be in a startup hub is like the questionof whether to take outside investment.  The question is not whetheryouneedit, but whether it brings any advantage at all.Because anything that brings an advantage will give your competitorsan advantage over you if they do it and you don\\'t.  So if you hearsomeone saying \"we don\\'t need to be in Silicon Valley,\" that useof the word \"need\" is a sign they\\'re not even thinking about thequestion right.And while startup hubs are as powerful magnets as ever, the increasingcheapness of starting a startup means the particles they\\'re attractingare getting lighter.  A startup now can be just a pair of 22 yearold guys.  A company like that can move much more easily than onewith 10 people, half of whom have kids.We know because we make people move for Y Combinator, and it doesn\\'tseem to be a problem. The advantage of being able to work togetherface to face for three months outweighs the inconvenience of moving.Ask anyone who\\'s done it.The mobility of seed-stage startups means that seed funding is anational business.  One of the most common emails we get is frompeople asking if we can help them set up a local clone of Y Combinator.But this just wouldn\\'t work. Seed funding isn\\'t regional, just asbig research universities aren\\'t.Is seed funding not merely national, but international?  Interestingquestion.  There are signs it may be.  We\\'ve had an ongoingstream of founders from outside the US, and they tend to doparticularly well, because they\\'re all people who were so determinedto succeed that they were willing to move to another country to doit.The more mobile startups get, the harder it would be to start new silicon valleys.  If startups are mobile, the best local talent will go to the real Silicon Valley,and all they\\'ll get at the local one will be the people who didn\\'thave the energy to move.This is not a nationalistic idea, incidentally.  It\\'s cities thatcompete, not countries.  Atlanta is just as hosed as Munich.7. Better Judgement NeededIf the number of startups increases dramatically, then the peoplewhose job is to judge them are going to have to get better atit.  I\\'m thinking particularly of investors and acquirers.  We nowget on the order of 1000 applications a year.  What are we goingto do if we get 10,000?That\\'s actually an alarming idea.  But we\\'ll figure out some kindof answer.  We\\'ll have to.  It will probably involve writing somesoftware, but fortunately we can do that.Acquirers will also have to get better at picking winners.   They generally do better than investors, because they picklater, when there\\'s more performance to measure.  But even at themost advanced acquirers, identifying companies tobuy is extremely ad hoc, and completing the acquisition ofteninvolves a great deal of unneccessary friction.I think acquirers may eventually have chief acquisition officerswho will both identify good acquisitions and make the deals happen.At the moment those two functions are separate.  Promising newstartups are often discovered by developers.  If someone powerfulenough wants to buy them, the deal is handed over to corp dev guysto negotiate.  It would be better if both were combined inone group, headed by someone with a technical background and somevision of what they wanted to accomplish.  Maybe in the future bigcompanies will have both a VP of Engineering responsible fortechnology developed in-house, and a CAO responsible for bringingtechnology in from outside.At the moment, there is no one within big companies who gets introuble when they buy a startup for $200 million that they couldhave bought earlier for $20 million.  There should start to besomeone who gets in trouble for that.8. College Will ChangeIf the best hackers start their own companies after collegeinstead of getting jobs, that will change what happens in college.Most of these changes will be for the better.  I think the experienceof college is warped in a bad way by the expectation that afterwardyou\\'ll be judged by potential employers.One change will be in the meaning of \"aftercollege,\" which will switch from when one graduates from collegeto when one leaves it.  If you\\'re starting your own company, whydo you need a degree?  We don\\'t encourage people to start startupsduring college, but the best founders are certainlycapable of it.  Some of the most successful companies we\\'ve fundedwere started by undergrads.I grew up in a time where college degrees seemed really important,so I\\'m alarmed to be saying things like this, but there\\'s nothingmagical about a degree.  There\\'s nothing that magically changesafter you take that last exam.  The importance of degrees is duesolely to the administrative needs of large organizations.  Thesecan certainly affect your life—it\\'s hard to get into gradschool, or to get a work visa in the US, without an undergraduatedegree—but tests like this will matter less andless.As well as mattering less whether students get degrees, it willalso start to matter less where they go to college.  In a startupyou\\'re judged by users, and they don\\'t care where you went tocollege.  So in a world of startups, elite universities will playless of a role as gatekeepers.  In the US it\\'s a national scandalhow easily children of rich parents game college admissions.But the way this problem ultimately gets solved may not be byreforming the universities but by going around them.  We in thetechnology world are used to that sort of solution: you don\\'t beatthe incumbents; you redefine the problem to make them irrelevant.The greatest value of universities is not the brand name or perhapseven the classes so much as the people you meet.  Ifit becomes common to start a startup after college, students may starttrying to maximize this.  Instead of focusing on gettinginternships at companies they want to work for, they may startto focus on working with other students they want as cofounders.What students do in their classes will change too.  Instead oftrying to get good grades to impress future employers, studentswill try to learn things.  We\\'re talking about some pretty dramaticchanges here.9. Lots of CompetitorsIf it gets easier to start a startup, it\\'s easier for competitors too. That doesn\\'t erase the advantage ofincreased cheapness, however.  You\\'re not all playing a zero-sumgame.  There\\'s not some fixed number of startups that can succeed,regardless of how many are started.In fact, I don\\'t think there\\'s any limit to the number of startupsthat could succeed.  Startups succeed by creating wealth, which isthe satisfaction of people\\'s desires.  And people\\'s desires seemto be effectively infinite, at least in the short term.What the increasing number of startups does mean is that you won\\'tbe able to sit on a good idea.  Other people have your idea, andthey\\'ll be increasingly likely to do something about it.10. Faster AdvancesThere\\'s a good side to that, at least for consumers oftechnology.  If people get right to work implementing ideas insteadof sitting on them, technology will evolve faster.Some kinds of innovations happen a company at a time, like thepunctuated equilibrium model of evolution.  There are some kindsof ideas that are so threatening that it\\'s hard for big companieseven to think of them.  Look at what a hard time Microsoft ishaving discovering web apps.  They\\'re like a character in a moviethat everyone in the audience can see something bad is about tohappen to, but who can\\'t see it himself.  The big innovationsthat happen a company at a time will obviously happen faster ifthe rate of new companies increases.But in fact there will be a double speed increase.  People won\\'twait as long to act on new ideas, but also those ideas willincreasingly be developed within startups rather than big companies.Which means technology will evolve faster per company as well.Big companies are just not a good place to make things happen fast.I talked recently to a founder whose startup had been acquired bya big company.  He was a precise sort of guy, so he\\'d measured theirproductivity before and after.  He counted lines of code, which canbe a dubious measure, but in this case was meaningful because itwas the same group of programmers.  He found they were one thirteenthas productive after the acquisition.The company that bought them was not a particularly stupid one.I think what he was measuring was mostly the cost of bigness.  Iexperienced this myself, and his number sounds about right.  There\\'ssomething about big companies that just sucks the energy out ofyou.Imagine what all that energy could do if it were put to use.  Thereis an enormous latent capacity in the world\\'s hackers that mostpeople don\\'t even realize is there.  That\\'s the main reason we doY Combinator: to let loose all this energy by making it easy forhackers to start their own startups.A Series of TubesThe process of starting startups is currently like the plumbing inan old house.  The pipes are narrow and twisty, and there are leaksin every joint.  In the future this mess will gradually be replacedby a single, huge pipe.  The water will still have to get from Ato B, but it will get there faster and without the risk of sprayingout through some random leak.This will change a lot of things for the better.  In a big, straightpipe like that, the force of being measured by one\\'s performancewill propagate back through the whole system.  Performance is alwaysthe ultimate test, but there are so many kinks in the plumbing nowthat most people are insulated from it most of the time.  So youend up with a world in which high school students think they needto get good grades to get into elite colleges, and college studentsthink they need to get good grades to impress employers, withinwhich the employees waste most of their time in political battles,and from which consumers have to buy anyway because there are sofew choices.  Imagine if that sequence became a big, straight pipe.Then the effects of being measured by performance would propagateall the way back to high school, flushing out all the arbitrarystuff people are measured by now.  That is the future of web startups.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Remember the essays you had to write in high school?Topic sentence, introductory paragraph,supporting paragraphs, conclusion.  The conclusion being,say, that Ahab inMoby Dickwas a Christ-like figure.Oy.  So I\\'m going to try to give the other side of thestory: what an essay really is, and how you write one.Or at least, how I write one.ModsThe most obvious difference between real essays andthe things one has to write in school is that realessays are not exclusively about English literature.Certainly schools should teach students how towrite.  But due to a series of historical accidentsthe teaching ofwriting has gotten mixed together with the studyof literature.  And so all over the country students arewriting not about how a baseball team with a small budgetmight compete with the Yankees, or the role of color infashion, or what constitutes a good dessert, but aboutsymbolism in Dickens.With the result that writing is made to seem boring andpointless.  Who cares about symbolism in Dickens?Dickens himself would be more interested in an essayabout color or baseball.How did things get this way?  To answer that we have to go backalmost a thousand years.  Around 1100, Europe at last began tocatch its breath after centuries of chaos, and once theyhad the luxury of curiosity they rediscoveredwhat we call \"the classics.\"  The effect was rather as ifwe were visited by beings from another solar system.These earlier civilizations were so much more sophisticatedthat for the next several centuries the main work ofEuropean scholars, in almost every field, was to assimilatewhat they knew.During this period the study of ancient texts acquired greatprestige.  It seemed the essence of what scholars did.  AsEuropean scholarship gained momentum it became less and less important;by 1350someone who wanted to learn about science could find betterteachers than Aristotle in his own era. [1]But schools change slower than scholarship.  In the19th century the study of ancient texts was still the backboneof the curriculum.The time was then ripe for the question: if the study ofancient texts is a valid field for scholarship, why not moderntexts?  The answer, of course, is that the original raison d\\'etreof classical scholarship was a kind of intellectual archaeology thatdoes not need to be done in the case of contemporary authors.But for obvious reasons no one wanted to give that answer.The archaeological work being mostly done, it implied thatthose studying the classics were, if not wasting theirtime, at least working on problems of minor importance.And so began the study of modern literature.  There was a gooddeal of resistance at first.The first courses in English literatureseem to have been offered by the newer colleges, particularlyAmerican ones.  Dartmouth, the University of Vermont, Amherst,and University College, Londontaught English literature in the 1820s.But Harvard didn\\'t have a professor of English literature until1876, and Oxford not till 1885. (Oxford had a chair of Chinese beforeit had one of English.) [2]What tipped the scales, at least in the US, seems to havebeen the idea that professors should do research as wellas teach.  This idea (along with the PhD, the department, andindeed the whole concept of the modern university) was importedfrom Germany in the late 19th century. Beginning atJohns Hopkins in 1876, the new model spread rapidly.Writing was one of the casualties.  Colleges had long taughtEnglish composition.  But how do you do research on composition?The professors who taught math could be required to do originalmath, the professors who taught history could be required towrite scholarly articles about history, but what about the  professors who taught rhetoric or composition?  What should theydo research on?  The closest thing seemed to be English literature. [3]And so in the late 19th century the teaching of writing was inheritedby English professors.  This had two drawbacks:(a) an expert on literature need not himself be a good writer,any more than an art historian has to be a good painter, and (b)the subject of writing now tends to be literature, since that\\'swhat the professor is interested in.High schools imitate universities.  The seeds of our miserablehigh school experiences were sown in 1892, whenthe National Education Association\"formally recommended that literatureand composition be unified in the high school course.\" [4]The \\'riting component of the 3 Rs then morphed into English,with the bizarre consequence that high school students nowhad to write about English literature-- to write, withouteven realizing it, imitations of whateverEnglish professors had been publishing in their journals a   few decades before.It\\'s no wonder if this seems to thestudent a pointless exercise, because we\\'re now three stepsremoved from real work: the students are imitating Englishprofessors, who are imitating classical scholars, who aremerely the inheritors of a tradition growing out of whatwas, 700 years ago, fascinating and urgently needed work.No DefenseThe other big difference between a real essay and the thingsthey make you write in school is that a real essay doesn\\'ttake a position and then defend it.  That principle,like the idea that we ought to be writing about literature,turns out to be another intellectual hangover of longforgotten origins.It\\'s often mistakenly believed thatmedieval universities were mostly seminaries.  In fact theywere more law schools.  And at least in our traditionlawyers are advocates, trained to takeeither side of an argument and make as good a case for itas they can.Whether cause or effect, this spirit pervadedearly universities.  The study of rhetoric, the art of arguingpersuasively, was a third of the undergraduate curriculum. [5]And after the lecture the most common formof discussion was the disputation.  This is at leastnominally preserved in our present-day thesis defense:most people treat the words thesisand dissertation as interchangeable, but originally, at least,a thesis was a position one took and the dissertation wasthe argument by which one defended it.Defending a position may be a necessary evil in alegal dispute, but it\\'s not the best way to get at the truth,as I think lawyers would be the first to admit.  It\\'s notjust that you miss subtleties this way.The real problem is that you can\\'t change the question.And yet this principle is built into the very structure ofthe things they teach you to write in high school.  The topic  sentence is your thesis, chosen in advance, the supportingparagraphs the blows you strike in the conflict, and theconclusion-- uh, what is the conclusion?  I was never sureabout that in high school.  It seemed as if we were justsupposed to restate what we said in the first paragraph,but in different enough words that no one could tell.Why bother?But when you understand the originsof this sort of \"essay,\" you can see where theconclusion comes from.  It\\'s the concluding remarks to the   jury.Good writing should be convincing, certainly, but itshould be convincing because you got the right answers,not because you did a good job of arguing.  When I give a draft of an essay to friends, there are two thingsI want to know: which parts bore them, and which seem   unconvincing.  The boring bits can usually be fixed by   cutting.  But I don\\'t try to fix the unconvincing bits byarguing more cleverly.  I need to talk the matter over.At the very least I must have explained something badly.  Inthat case, in the course of the conversation I\\'ll be forcedto come up a with a clearer explanation, which I can justincorporate in the essay.  More often than not I haveto change what I was saying as well.But the aim is never to be convincing per se.As the reader gets smarter, convincing and true become identical,so if I can convince smart readers I must be near the truth.The sort of writing that attempts to persuade may bea valid (or at least inevitable) form, but it\\'s historicallyinaccurate to call it an essay.  An essay is something else.TryingTo understand what a real essay is, we have toreach back into history again, though this time not so far.To Michel de Montaigne, who in 1580 published a book ofwhat he called \"essais.\" He wasdoing something quite different from what lawyers do, andthe difference is embodied in the name.Essayeris the Frenchverb meaning \"to try\"and anessaiis an attempt.  An essay is something youwrite to try to figure something out.Figure out what?  You don\\'t know yet.  And so you can\\'t begin with athesis, because you don\\'t have one, and may never haveone.  An essay doesn\\'t begin with a statement, but with aquestion.  In a real essay, you don\\'t take a position anddefend it.  You notice a door that\\'s ajar, and you open it andwalk in to see what\\'s inside.If all you want to do is figure things out, why do you needto write anything, though?  Why not just sit and think?  Well,there precisely is Montaigne\\'s great discovery.  Expressing    ideas helps to form them.  Indeed, helps is far too weak aword.  Most of what ends up in my essays I onlythought of when I sat down to write them.  That\\'s why I   write them.In the things you write in school you are, in theory,merely explaining yourself to the reader.In a real essay you\\'re writing for yourself.You\\'re thinking out loud.But not quite.Just as inviting people over forces you toclean up your apartment, writing something thatother people will read forces you to think well.  So itdoes matter to have an audience.  The things I\\'ve writtenjust for myself are no good.They tend to peter out.  When I run intodifficulties, I find I conclude with a few vaguequestions and then drift off to get a cup of tea.Many published essays peter out in the same way.Particularly the sort written by the staff writers of newsmagazines.  Outside writers tend to supplyeditorials of the defend-a-position variety, whichmake a beeline toward a rousing (andforeordained) conclusion.   But the staff writers feelobliged to write something \"balanced.\"Since they\\'re writing for a popular magazine, they start with themost radioactively controversial questions, from which-- becausethey\\'re writing for a popular magazine-- theythen proceed to recoil in terror.Abortion, for or against?This group says one thing.  That group saysanother.  One thing is certain: the question is acomplex one.  (But don\\'t get mad at us.  We didn\\'tdraw any conclusions.)The RiverQuestions aren\\'t enough.  An essay has to come up with answers.They don\\'t always, of course.  Sometimes you start with apromising question and get nowhere.  But those you don\\'t   publish.  Those are like experiments that get inconclusiveresults.   An essay you publish ought to tell the reader       something he didn\\'t already know.Butwhatyou tell him doesn\\'t matter, so long as    it\\'s interesting.  I\\'m sometimes accused of meandering.In defend-a-position writing that would be a flaw.There you\\'re not concerned with truth.  You alreadyknow where you\\'re going, and you want to go straight there,blustering through obstacles, and hand-wavingyour way across swampy ground.  But that\\'s not whatyou\\'re trying to do in an essay.  An essay is supposed tobe a search for truth.  It would be suspicious if it didn\\'tmeander.The Meander (aka Menderes) is a river in Turkey.As you might expect, it winds all over the place.But it doesn\\'t do this out of frivolity.The path it has discovered is the mosteconomical route to the sea. [6]The river\\'s algorithm is simple.  At each step, flow down.For the essayist this translates to: flow interesting.   Of all the places to go next, choose the most interesting.One can\\'t have quite as little foresight as a river.  I alwaysknow generally what I want to write about.But not thespecific conclusions I want to reach; from paragraph toparagraph I let the ideas take their course.This doesn\\'t always work.  Sometimes, like a river,one runs up against a wall.  Then I do the same thing the river does:backtrack.  At one point in this essayI found that after following a certain thread I ran outof ideas.  I had to go back seven paragraphs and start overin another direction.Fundamentally an essay is a train of thought-- but a cleaned-uptrain of thought, as dialogue is cleaned-up conversation.Real thought, like real conversation, is full of false starts.It would be exhausting to read.  You need to cut and fill toemphasize the central thread, like anillustrator inking over a pencil drawing.  But don\\'tchange so much that you lose the spontaneity of the original.Err on the side of the river.  An essay is not a referencework.  It\\'s not something you read looking for a specificanswer, and feel cheated if you don\\'t find it.  I\\'d muchrather read an essay that went off in an unexpected butinteresting direction than one that plodded dutifully alonga prescribed course.SurpriseSo what\\'s interesting?  For me, interesting means surprise.Interfaces, as Geoffrey James has said, should follow the principle ofleast astonishment.   A button that looks like it will make amachine stop should make it stop, not speed up.  Essays    should do the opposite.  Essays should aim for maximumsurprise.I was afraid of flying for a long time and could only travelvicariously.  When friends came back from faraway places,it wasn\\'t just out of politeness that I askedwhat they saw.  I really wanted to know.  And I foundthe best way to get information out of them was to askwhat surprised them.  How was the place different from whatthey expected?  This is an extremely useful question.You can ask it of the most unobservant people, and it will extract information they didn\\'t even know they wererecording.Surprises are things that you not only didn\\'t know, but thatcontradict things youthought you knew.  And so they\\'re the most valuable sort offact you can get.  They\\'re like a food that\\'s not merelyhealthy, but counteracts the unhealthy effects of thingsyou\\'ve already eaten.How do you find surprises?  Well, therein lies halfthe work of essay writing.  (The other half is expressingyourself well.)   The trick is to use yourself as aproxy for the reader.  You should only write about thingsyou\\'ve thought about a lot.  And anything you come acrossthat surprises you, who\\'ve thought about the topic a lot,will probably surprise most readers.For example, in a recentessayI pointed out that becauseyou can only judge computer programmers by working withthem, no one knows who the best programmers are overall.I didn\\'t realize this when I beganthat essay, and even now I find it kind of weird.  That\\'swhat you\\'re looking for.So if you want to write essays, you need two ingredients:a few topics you\\'ve thought about a lot, andsome ability to ferret out the unexpected.What should you think about?  My guess is that itdoesn\\'t matter-- that anything can be interesting if you get deeplyenough into it.  One possible exception might be thingsthat have deliberately had all the variation sucked out of them,like working in fast food.  In retrospect, was thereanything interesting about working at Baskin-Robbins?Well, it was interesting how important color wasto the customers.  Kids a certain age would point intothe case and say that they wanted yellow.  Did they want French Vanilla or Lemon?  They would just look at you   blankly.  They wanted yellow.  And then there was the  mystery of why the perennial favorite Pralines \\'n\\' Cream   was so appealing.  (I think now it was the salt.)And the difference in the way fathers andmothers bought ice cream for their kids: the fatherslike benevolent kings bestowing largesse, the mothersharried, giving in to pressure.So, yes, there does seem to be some material even infast food.I didn\\'t notice those things at the time, though.  At sixteenI was about as observant as a lump of rock.  I can see more now inthe fragments of memory I preserve of that age than I could seeat the time from having it all happening live, right in front of me.ObservationSo the ability to ferret out the unexpected must not merely be aninborn one.  It must be something you can learn.How do you learn it?To some extent it\\'s like learning history.When you first readhistory, it\\'s just a whirl of namesand dates.  Nothing seems to stick.  But the more you learn, the more hooks you havefor new facts to stick onto-- which meansyou accumulate knowledge at an exponential rate.  Once youremember that Normans conqueredEngland in 1066, it will catch your attention when you hearthat other Normans conquered southern Italy at about the same time.Which will make you wonder about Normandy, and take notewhen a third book mentions that Normanswere not, like most of what is nowcalled France, tribes that flowed in as the Roman empire collapsed,but Vikings (norman = north man) who arrivedfour centuries later in 911.  Which makesit easier to remember that Dublin was also established byVikings in the 840s.  Etc, etc squared.Collecting surprises is a similar process.The more anomalies you\\'ve seen, the more easily you\\'ll noticenew ones.   Which means, oddly enough, that as you grow older,life should become more and more surprising.  When I was akid, I used to think adults had it all figured out.I had it backwards.  Kids are the ones who have it all figured  out.  They\\'re just mistaken.When it comes to surprises, the rich get richer.  But(as with wealth) theremay be habits of mind that will help the process along.  It\\'sgood to have a habit of asking questions, especially questionsbeginning with Why.But not in the random way that three yearolds ask why.  There are an infinite number of questions.How do you find the fruitful ones?I find it especiallyuseful to ask why about things that seem wrong.For example, why should there be a connection betweenhumor and misfortune?  Why do we find it funny when acharacter, even one we like, slips on a banana peel?There\\'s a whole essay\\'s worth of surprises there for sure.If you want to notice things that seem wrong, you\\'ll find adegree of skepticism helpful.  I take it as an axiomthat we\\'re only achieving 1% of what we could.This helps counteract the rule that gets beaten into ourheads as children: that things are the way they are becausethat is how things have to be.For example, everyone I\\'ve talked to while writing this essay  felt the same aboutEnglish classes-- that the whole process seemed pointless.But none of us had the balls at the time to hypothesize thatit was, in fact, all a mistake.We all thought there was just something we weren\\'t getting.I have a hunch you want to pay attention not just to thingsthat seem wrong, but things that seem wrong in a humorous way.  I\\'m always pleased when I see someone laugh as theyread a draft of an essay.  But why should I be?  I\\'m aimingfor good ideas.  Why should good ideas be funny?The connection may be surprise.Surprises make us laugh, and surprises are whatone wants to deliver.I write down things that surprise me in notebooks.  I neveractually get around to reading them and usingwhat I\\'ve written, but I do tend toreproduce the same thoughts later.  So the main valueof notebooks may be what writing things down leaves in yourhead.People trying to be cool will find themselves at a disadvantagewhen collecting surprises.  To be surprised is to be mistaken.And the essence of cool, as any fourteen year old could tellyou, isnil admirari.When you\\'re mistaken, don\\'tdwell on it; just act like nothing\\'s wrong and maybe no onewill notice.One of the keys to coolness is to avoid situations whereinexperience may make you look foolish. If you want to find surprises you should do the opposite.Study lots of different things,because some of the most interesting surprises are unexpectedconnections between different fields.  For example, jam, bacon, pickles, and cheese, which are among the most pleasingof foods, were all originally intended as methods of preservation.And so were books and paintings.Whatever you study, include history-- but social and economichistory, not political history.  History seems to me so importantthat it\\'s misleading to treat it as a mere field of study.Another way to describe it isall the data we have so far.Among other things, studying history gives one confidence thatthere are good ideas waiting to be discovered right under our noses.Swords evolved during the Bronze Age out of daggers, which(like their flint predecessors) had a hilt separate from theblade.  Because swords are longerthe hilts kept breaking off.  But it took five hundred yearsbefore someone thought of casting hilt and blade as onepiece.DisobedienceAbove all, make a habit of payingattention to things you\\'re not supposed to, either because they\\'re \"inappropriate,\" or not important, or not what you\\'resupposed to be working on.  If you\\'re curious about something,trust your instincts.Follow the threads that attract yourattention.  If there\\'s something you\\'re really interestedin, you\\'ll find they have an uncanny way of leading back toit anyway, just as the conversation of people who are especiallyproud of something always tends to lead back to it.For example, I\\'ve always been fascinated by comb-overs, especiallythe extreme sort thatmake a man look as if he\\'s wearing a beret made of his own hair.Surely this is a lowly sort of thing to be interested in-- thesort of superficial quizzingbest left to teenage girls.  And yet there is something underneath.The key question, I realized, is how does the comber-over notsee how odd he looks?And the answer is that he got to look that wayincrementally.What began as combing his hair a little carefully over athin patch has gradually, over 20 years, grown into a monstrosity.Gradualness is very powerful.  And that power can beused for constructive purposes too: just as you can trickyourself into looking like a freak, you can trick yourself intocreating something so grand that you would never have dared toplansuch a thing.  Indeed, this is just how most goodsoftware gets created.  You start by writing a stripped-downkernel (how hard can it be?) and gradually it growsinto a complete operating system.  Hence the next leap: couldyou do the same thing in painting, or in a novel?See what you can extract from a frivolous question?If there\\'s one piece of advice I would give about writing essays,it would be: don\\'t do as you\\'re told.Don\\'t believe what you\\'re supposed to.Don\\'t write theessay readers expect; one learns nothing fromwhat one expects.Anddon\\'t write the way they taught you to in school.The most important sort of disobedience is to writeessays at all.  Fortunately, this sort of disobedience showssigns of becomingrampant. It used to be that only a tinynumber of officially approved writers were allowed towrite essays.  Magazines published few of them, and judgedthem less by what they said than who wrote them;a magazine might publish a story by anunknown writer if it was good enough, but if they publishedan essay on x it had to be by someone who was at leastforty and whose job title had x in it.  Which is a problem,because there are a lot of things insiders can\\'t say preciselybecause they\\'re insiders.The Internet is changing that.Anyone can publish an essay on the Web, and it gets judged, as anywriting should, by what it says, not who wrote it.Who are you to write about x?  You are whatever you wrote.Popular magazines made the period between the spreadof literacy and the arrival of TV the golden age of theshort story.The Web may well make this the golden age of the essay.And that\\'s certainly not something I realized whenI started writing this.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'If there were intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe, they\\'dshare certain truths in common with us. The truths of mathematicswould be the same, because they\\'re true by definition. Ditto forthe truths of physics; the mass of a carbon atom would be the sameon their planet. But I think we\\'d share other truths with aliensbesides the truths of math and physics, and that it would beworthwhile to think about what these might be.For example, I think we\\'d share the principle that a controlledexperiment testing some hypothesis entitles us to have proportionallyincreased belief in it. It seems fairly likely, too, that it wouldbe true for aliens that one can get better at something by practicing.We\\'d probably share Occam\\'s razor. There doesn\\'t seem anythingspecifically human about any of these ideas.We can only guess, of course. We can\\'t say for sure what formsintelligent life might take. Nor is it my goal here to explore thatquestion, interesting though it is. The point of the idea of alientruth is not that it gives us a way to speculate about what formsintelligent life might take, but that it gives us a threshold, ormore precisely a target, for truth. If you\\'re trying to find themost general truths short of those of math or physics, then presumablythey\\'ll be those we\\'d share in common with other forms of intelligentlife.Alien truth will work best as a heuristic if we err on the side ofgenerosity. If an idea might plausibly be relevant to aliens, that\\'senough. Justice, for example. I wouldn\\'t want to bet that allintelligent beings would understand the concept of justice, but Iwouldn\\'t want to bet against it either.The idea of alien truth is related to Erdos\\'s idea of God\\'s book.He used to describe a particularly good proof as being in God\\'sbook, the implication being (a) that a sufficiently good proof wasmore discovered than invented, and (b) that its goodness would beuniversally recognized. If there\\'s such a thing as alien truth,then there\\'s more in God\\'s book than math.What should we call the search for alien truth? The obvious choiceis \"philosophy.\" Whatever else philosophy includes, it shouldprobably include this. I\\'m fairly sure Aristotle would have thoughtso. One could even make the case that the search for alien truthis, if not an accurate descriptionofphilosophy, a gooddefinitionforit. I.e. that it\\'s what people who callthemselves philosophers should be doing, whether or not they currentlyare. But I\\'m not wedded to that; doing it is what matters, not whatwe call it.We may one day have something like alien life among us in the formof AIs. And that may in turn allow us to be precise about whattruths an intelligent being would have to share with us. We mightfind, for example, that it\\'s impossible to create something we\\'dconsider intelligent that doesn\\'t use Occam\\'s razor. We might oneday even be able to prove that. But though this sort of researchwould be very interesting, it\\'s not necessary for our purposes, oreven the same field; the goal of philosophy, if we\\'re going to call it that, would beto see what ideas we come up with using alien truth as a target,not to say precisely where the threshold of it is. Those two questions might oneday converge, but they\\'ll converge from quite different directions,and till they do, it would be too constraining to restrict ourselvesto thinking only about things we\\'re certain would be alien truths.Especially since this will probably be one of those areas where thebest guesses turn out to be surprisingly close to optimal. (Let\\'ssee if that one does.)Whatever we call it, the attempt to discover alien truths would bea worthwhile undertaking. And curiously enough, that is itselfprobably an alien truth.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.April 2010The best way to come up with startup ideas is to ask yourself thequestion: what do you wish someone would make for you?There are two types of startup ideas: those that grow organicallyout of your own life, and those that you decide, from afar, aregoing to be necessary to some class of users other than you.  Applewas the first type.  Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted acomputer.  Unlike most people who wanted computers, he could designone, so he did.  And since lots of other people wanted the samething, Apple was able to sell enough of them to get the companyrolling.  They still rely on this principle today, incidentally.The iPhone is the phone Steve Jobs wants.Our own startup, Viaweb, was of the second type.  We made softwarefor building online stores.  We didn\\'t need this software ourselves.We weren\\'t direct marketers.  We didn\\'t even know when we startedthat our users were called \"direct marketers.\"  But we werecomparatively old when we started the company (I was 30 and RobertMorris was 29), so we\\'d seen enough to know users would need thistype of software.There is no sharp line between the two types of ideas, butthe most successful startups seem to be closer to the Apple typethan the Viaweb type.  When he was writing that first Basic interpreterfor the Altair, Bill Gates was writing something he would use, aswere Larry and Sergey when they wrote the first versions of Google.Organic ideas are generally preferable to the made up kind, butparticularly so when the founders are young.  It takes experienceto predict what other people will want.  The worst ideas we see atY Combinator are from young founders making things they think otherpeople will want.So if you want to start a startup and don\\'t know yet what you\\'regoing to do, I\\'d encourage you to focus initially on organic ideas.What\\'s missing or broken in your daily life?  Sometimes if you justask that question you\\'ll get immediate answers.  It must have seemedobviously broken to Bill Gates that you could only program theAltair in machine language.You may need to stand outside yourself a bit to see brokenness,because you tend to get used to it and take it for granted.  Youcan be sure it\\'s there, though.  There are always great ideas sittingright under our noses.  In 2004 it was ridiculous that Harvardundergrads were still using a Facebook printed on paper.  Surelythat sort of thing should have been online.There are ideas that obvious lying around now.  The reason you\\'reoverlooking them is the same reason you\\'d have overlooked the ideaof building Facebook in 2004: organic startup ideas usually don\\'tseem like startup ideas at first.  We know now that Facebook wasvery successful, but put yourself back in 2004.  Putting undergraduates\\'profiles online wouldn\\'t have seemed like much of a startup idea.And in fact, it wasn\\'t initially a startup idea.  When Mark spokeat a YC dinner this winter he said he wasn\\'t trying to start acompany when he wrote the first version of Facebook.  It was justa project.  So was the Apple I when Woz first started working onit.  He didn\\'t think he was starting a company.  If these guys hadthought they were starting companies, they might have been temptedto do something more \"serious,\" and that would have been a mistake.So if you want to come up with organic startup ideas, I\\'d encourageyou to focus more on the idea part and less on the startup part.Just fix things that seem broken, regardless of whether it seemslike the problem is important enough to build a company on.  If youkeep pursuing such threads it would be hard not to end up makingsomething of value to a lot of people, and when you do, surprise,you\\'ve got a company.Don\\'t be discouraged if what you produce initially is somethingother people dismiss as a toy.  In fact, that\\'s a good sign.That\\'s probably why everyone else has been overlooking the idea.  The firstmicrocomputers were dismissed as toys.  And the first planes, andthe first cars.  At this point, when someone comes to us withsomething that users like but that we could envision forum trollsdismissing as a toy, it makes us especially likely to invest.While young founders are at a disadvantage when coming up withmade-up ideas, they\\'re the best source of organic ones, becausethey\\'re at the forefront of technology.  They use the latest stuff.They only just decided what to use, so why wouldn\\'t they?  Andbecause they use the latest stuff, they\\'re in a position to discovervaluable types of fixable brokenness first.There\\'s nothing more valuable than an unmet need that is justbecoming fixable.  If you find something broken that you can fixfor a lot of people, you\\'ve found a gold mine.  As with an actualgold mine, you still have to work hard to get the gold out of it.But at least you know where the seam is, and that\\'s the hard part.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.June 2006(This essay is derived from talks at Usenix 2006 andRailsconf 2006.)A couple years ago my friend Trevor and I went to look at the Applegarage.  As we stood there, he said that as a kid growing up inSaskatchewan he\\'d been amazed at the dedication Jobs and Wozniakmust have had to work in a garage.\"Those guys must have beenfreezing!\"That\\'s one of California\\'s hidden advantages: the mild climate meansthere\\'s lots of marginal space.  In cold places that margin getstrimmed off.  There\\'s a sharper line between outside and inside,and only projects that are officially sanctioned — by organizations,or parents, or wives, or at least by oneself — get proper indoorspace.  That raises the activation energy for new ideas.  You can\\'tjust tinker. You have to justify.Some of Silicon Valley\\'s most famous companies began in garages:Hewlett-Packard in 1938, Apple in 1976, Google in 1998.  In Apple\\'scase the garage story is a bit of an urban legend.  Woz says allthey did there was assemble some computers, and that he did all theactual design of the Apple I and Apple II in his apartment or hiscube at HP.This was apparently too marginal even for Apple\\'s PRpeople.By conventional standards, Jobs and Wozniak were marginal peopletoo.  Obviously they were smart, but they can\\'t have looked goodon paper.  They were at the time a pair of college dropouts withabout three years of school between them, and hippies to boot.Their previous business experience consisted of making \"blue boxes\"to hack into the phone system, a business with the rare distinctionof being both illegal and unprofitable.OutsidersNow a startup operating out of a garage in Silicon Valley wouldfeel part of an exalted tradition, like the poet in his garret, orthe painter who can\\'t afford to heat his studio and thus has towear a beret indoors.  But in 1976 it didn\\'t seem so cool.  Theworld hadn\\'t yet realized that starting a computer company was inthe same category as being a writer or a painter. It hadn\\'t beenfor long.  Only in the preceding couple years had the dramatic fallin the cost of hardware allowed outsiders to compete.In 1976, everyone looked down on a company operating out of a garage,including the founders.  One of the first things Jobs did when theygot some money was to rent office space.  He wanted Apple to seemlike a real company.They already had something few real companies ever have: a fabulously welldesigned product.  You\\'d think they\\'d have had more confidence.But I\\'ve talked to a lot of startup founders, and it\\'s always thisway.  They\\'ve built something that\\'s going to change the world, andthey\\'re worried about some nit like not having proper businesscards.That\\'s the paradox I want to explore: great new things often comefrom the margins, and yet the people who discover them are lookeddown on by everyone, including themselves.It\\'s an old idea that new things come from the margins. I want toexamine its internal structure.  Why do great ideas come from themargins?  What kind of ideas?  And is there anything we can do toencourage the process?InsidersOne reason so many good ideas come from the margin is simply thatthere\\'s so much of it. There have to be more outsiders than insiders,if insider means anything.  If the number of outsiders is huge itwill always seem as if a lot of ideas come from them, even if fewdo per capita.  But I think there\\'s more going on than this.  Thereare real disadvantages to being an insider, and in some kinds ofwork they can outweigh the advantages.Imagine, for example, what would happen if the government decidedto commission someone to write an official Great American Novel.First there\\'d be a huge ideological squabble over who to choose.Most of the best writers would be excluded for having offended oneside or the other.  Of the remainder, the smart ones would refusesuch a job, leaving only a few with the wrong sort of ambition.The committee would choose one at the height of his career — thatis, someone whose best work was behind him — and hand over theproject with copious free advice about how the book should show inpositive terms the strength and diversity of the American people,etc, etc.The unfortunate writer would then sit down to work with a hugeweight of expectation on his shoulders.  Not wanting to blow sucha public commission, he\\'d play it safe.  This book had better commandrespect, and the way to ensure that would be to make it a tragedy.Audiences have to be enticed to laugh, but if you kill people theyfeel obliged to take you seriously.  As everyone knows, Americaplus tragedy equals the Civil War, so that\\'s what it would have tobe about. When finallycompleted twelve years later, the book would be a 900-page pasticheof existing popular novels — roughlyGone with the WindplusRoots.  But its bulk and celebrity would make it a bestsellerfor a few months, until blown out of the water by a talk-show host\\'sautobiography.  The book would be made into a movie and thereuponforgotten, except by the more waspish sort of reviewers, among whomit would be a byword for bogusness like Milli Vanilli orBattlefieldEarth.Maybe I got a little carried away with this example.  And yet isthis not at each point the way such a project would play out?  Thegovernment knows better than to get into the novel business, butin other fields where they have a natural monopoly, like nuclearwaste dumps, aircraft carriers, and regime change, you\\'d find plentyof projects isomorphic to this one — and indeed, plenty that wereless successful.This little thought experiment suggests a few of the disadvantagesof insider projects: the selection of the wrong kind of people, theexcessive scope, the inability to take risks, the need to seemserious, the weight of expectations, the power of vested interests,the undiscerning audience, and perhaps most dangerous, the tendencyof such work to become a duty rather than a pleasure.TestsA world with outsiders and insiders implies some kind of test fordistinguishing between them.  And the trouble with most tests forselecting elites is that there are two ways to pass them: to begood at what they try to measure, and to be good at hacking thetest itself.So the first question to ask about a field is how honest its testsare, because this tells you what it means to be an outsider.  Thistells you how much to trust your instincts when you disagree withauthorities, whether it\\'s worth going through the usual channelsto become one yourself, and perhaps whether you want to work inthis field at all.Tests are least hackable when there are consistent standards forquality, and the people running the test really care about itsintegrity.  Admissions to PhD programs in the hard sciences arefairly honest, for example.  The professors will get whoever theyadmit as their own grad students, so they try hard to choose well,and they have a fair amount of data to go on.  Whereas undergraduateadmissions seem to be much more hackable.One way to tell whether a field has consistent standards is theoverlap between the leading practitioners and the people who teachthe subject in universities.  At one end of the scale you havefields like math and physics, where nearly all the teachers areamong the best practitioners.  In the middle are medicine, law,history, architecture, and computer science, where many are.  Atthe bottom are business, literature, and the visual arts, wherethere\\'s almost no overlap between the teachers and the leadingpractitioners.  It\\'s this end that gives rise to phrases like \"thosewho can\\'t do, teach.\"Incidentally, this scale might be helpful in deciding what to studyin college.  When I was in college the rule seemed to be that youshould study whatever you were most interested in.  But in retrospectyou\\'re probably better off studying something moderately interestingwith someone who\\'s good at it than something very interesting withsomeone who isn\\'t.  You often hear people say that you shouldn\\'tmajor in business in college, but this is actually an instance ofa more general rule: don\\'t learn things from teachers who are badat them.How much you should worry about being an outsider depends on thequality of the insiders.  If you\\'re an amateur mathematician andthink you\\'ve solved a famous open problem, better go back and check.When I was in grad school, a friend in the math department had thejob of replying to people who sent in proofs of Fermat\\'s last theoremand so on, and it did not seem as if he saw it as a valuable sourceof tips — more like manning a mental health hotline.  Whereas ifthe stuff you\\'re writing seems different from what English professorsare interested in, that\\'s not necessarily a problem.Anti-TestsWhere the method of selecting the elite is thoroughly corrupt, mostof the good people will be outsiders.  In art, for example, theimage of the poor, misunderstood genius is not just one possibleimage of a great artist: it\\'s thestandardimage.  I\\'m notsaying it\\'s correct, incidentally, but it is telling how well thisimage has stuck.  You couldn\\'t make a rap like that stick to mathor medicine.If it\\'s corrupt enough, a test becomes an anti-test, filtering outthe people it should select by making them to do things only thewrong people would do.Popularityin high schoolseems to be such a test.  There are plenty of similar ones in the grownupworld.  For example, rising up through the hierarchy of the averagebig company demands an attention to politics few thoughtful peoplecould spare.Someone like Bill Gates can grow a company underhim, but it\\'s hard to imagine him having the patience to climb thecorporate ladder at General Electric — or Microsoft, actually.It\\'s kind of strange when you think about it, because lord-of-the-fliesschools and bureaucratic companies are both the default.  There areprobably a lot of people who go from one to the other and neverrealize the whole world doesn\\'t work this way.I think that\\'s one reason big companies are so often blindsided bystartups.  People at big companies don\\'t realize the extent to whichthey live in an environment that is one large, ongoing test for thewrong qualities.If you\\'re an outsider, your best chances for beating insiders areobviously in fields where corrupt tests select a lame elite.  Butthere\\'s a catch: if the tests are corrupt, your victory won\\'t berecognized, at least in your lifetime.  You may feel you don\\'t needthat, but history suggests it\\'s dangerous to work in fields withcorrupt tests.  You may beat the insiders, and yet not do as goodwork, on an absolute scale, as you would in a field that was morehonest.Standards in art, for example, were almost as corrupt in the firsthalf of the eighteenth century as they are today.  This was the eraof those fluffy idealized portraits of countesses with their lapdogs.Chardindecided to skip all that and paint ordinary things as hesaw them.  He\\'s now considered the best of that period — and yetnot the equal of Leonardo or Bellini or Memling, who all had theadditional encouragement of honest standards.It can be worth participating in a corrupt contest, however, ifit\\'s followed by another that isn\\'t corrupt.  For example, it wouldbe worth competing with a company that can spend more than you onmarketing, as long as you can survive to the next round, whencustomers compare your actual products.  Similarly, you shouldn\\'tbe discouraged by the comparatively corrupt test of college admissions,because it\\'s followed immediately by less hackable tests.RiskEven in a field with honest tests, there are still advantages tobeing an outsider.  The most obvious is that outsiders have nothingto lose.  They can do risky things, and if they fail, so what?  Fewwill even notice.The eminent, on the other hand, are weighed down by their eminence.Eminence is like a suit: it impresses the wrong people, and itconstrains the wearer.Outsiders should realize the advantage they have here.  Being ableto take risks is hugely valuable.  Everyone values safety too much,both the obscure and the eminent.  No one wants to look like a fool.But it\\'s very useful to be able to.  If most of your ideas aren\\'tstupid, you\\'re probably being too conservative.  You\\'re not bracketingthe problem.Lord Acton said we should judge talent at its best and characterat its worst.  For example, if you write one great book and ten badones, you still count as a great writer — or at least, a betterwriter than someone who wrote eleven that were merely good.  Whereasif you\\'re a quiet, law-abiding citizen most of the time butoccasionally cut someone up and bury them in your backyard, you\\'rea bad guy.Almost everyone makes the mistake of treating ideas as if they wereindications of character rather than talent — as if having a stupididea made you stupid.   There\\'s a huge weight of tradition advisingus to play it safe.  \"Even a fool is thought wise if he keepssilent,\" says the Old Testament (Proverbs 17:28).Well, that may be fine advice for a bunch of goatherds in BronzeAge Palestine.  There conservatism would be the order of the day.But times have changed.  It might still be reasonable to stick withthe Old Testament in political questions, but materially the worldnow has a lot more state.  Tradition is less of a guide, not justbecause things change faster, but because the space of possibilitiesis so large.   The more complicated the world gets, the more valuableit is to be willing to look like a fool.DelegationAnd yet the more successful people become, the more heat they getif they screw up — or even seem to screw up.  In this respect, asin many others, the eminent are prisoners of their own success.  Sothe best way to understand the advantages of being an outsider maybe to look at the disadvantages of being an insider.If you ask eminent people what\\'s wrong with their lives, the firstthing they\\'ll complain about is the lack of time.  A friend of mineat Google is fairly high up in the company and went to work forthem long before they went public.  In other words, he\\'s now richenough not to have to work.  I asked him if he could still endurethe annoyances of having a job, now that he didn\\'t have to.  Andhe said that there weren\\'t really any annoyances, except — and hegot a wistful look when he said this — that he gotso muchemail.The eminent feel like everyone wants to take a bite out of them.The problem is so widespread that people pretending to be eminentdo it by pretending to be overstretched.The lives of the eminent become scheduled, and that\\'s not good forthinking.  One of the great advantages of being an outsider is long,uninterrupted blocks of time.  That\\'s what I remember about gradschool: apparently endless supplies of time, which I spent worryingabout, but not writing, my dissertation.  Obscurity is like healthfood — unpleasant, perhaps, but good for you.  Whereas fame tendsto be like the alcohol produced by fermentation. When it reachesa certain concentration, it kills off the yeast that produced it.The eminent generally respond to the shortage of time by turninginto managers.  They don\\'t have time to work.  They\\'re surroundedby junior people they\\'re supposed to help or supervise.  The obvioussolution is to have the junior people do the work.  Some goodstuff happens this way, but there are problems it doesn\\'t work sowell for: the kind where it helps to have everything in one head.For example, it recently emerged that the famous glass artist DaleChihuly hasn\\'t actually blown glass for 27 years.  He has assistantsdo the work for him.  But one of the most valuable sources of ideasin the visual arts is the resistance of the medium.  That\\'s why oilpaintings look so different from watercolors.  In principle youcould make any mark in any medium; in practice the medium steersyou.  And if you\\'re no longer doing the work yourself, you stoplearning from this.So if you want to beat those eminent enough to delegate, one wayto do it is to take advantage of direct contact with the medium.In the arts it\\'s obvious how: blow your own glass, edit your ownfilms, stage your own plays.  And in the process pay close attentionto accidents and to new ideas you have on the fly.  This techniquecan be generalized to any sort of work: if you\\'re an outsider, don\\'tbe ruled by plans.  Planning is often just a weakness forced onthose who delegate.Is there a general rule for finding problems best solved in onehead?  Well, you can manufacture them by taking any project usuallydone by multiple people and trying to do it all yourself.  Wozniak\\'swork was a classic example: he did everything himself, hardware andsoftware, and the result was miraculous.  He claims not one bug wasever found in the Apple II, in either hardware or software.Another way to find good problems to solve in one head is to focuson the grooves in the chocolate bar — the places where tasks aredivided when they\\'re split between several people.  If you want tobeat delegation, focus on a vertical slice: for example, be bothwriter and editor, or both design buildings and construct them.One especially good groove to span is the one between tools andthings made with them.  For example, programming languages andapplications are usually written by different people, and this isresponsible for a lot of the worst flaws inprogramming languages.I think every language should be designed simultaneously with alarge application written in it, the way C was with Unix.Techniques for competing with delegation translate well into business,because delegation is endemic there.  Instead of avoiding it as adrawback of senility, many companies embrace it as a sign of maturity.In big companies software is often designed, implemented, and soldby three separate types of people.  In startups one person may haveto do all three.  And though this feels stressful, it\\'s one reasonstartups win.  The needs of customers and the means of satisfyingthem are all in one head.FocusThe very skill of insiders can be a weakness.  Once someone is goodat something, they tend to spend all their time doing that.  Thiskind of focus is very valuable, actually.  Much of the skill ofexperts is the ability to ignore false trails.  But focus hasdrawbacks: you don\\'t learn from other fields, and when a new approacharrives, you may be the last to notice.For outsiders this translates into two ways to win.  One is to workon a variety of things.  Since you can\\'t derive as much benefit(yet) from a narrow focus, you may as well cast a wider net andderive what benefit you can from similarities between fields.  Justas you can compete with delegation by working on larger verticalslices, you can compete with specialization by working on largerhorizontal slices — by both writing and illustrating your book, forexample.The second way to compete with focus is to see what focus overlooks.In particular, new things.  So if you\\'re not good at anything yet,consider working on something so new that no one else is either.It won\\'t have any prestige yet, if no one is good at it, but you\\'llhave it all to yourself.The potential of a new medium is usually underestimated, preciselybecause no one has yet explored its possibilities.  BeforeDurertried making engravings, no one took them very seriously.  Engravingwas for making little devotional images — basically fifteenth centurybaseball cards of saints.  Trying to make masterpieces in thismedium must have seemed to Durer\\'s contemporaries the way that,say, making masterpieces incomicsmight seem to the average persontoday.In the computer world we get not new mediums but new platforms: theminicomputer, the microprocessor, the web-based application.  Atfirst they\\'re always dismissed as being unsuitable for real work.And yet someone always decides to try anyway, and it turns out youcan do more than anyone expected.  So in the future when you hearpeople say of a new platform: yeah, it\\'s popular and cheap, but notready yet for real work, jump on it.As well as being more comfortable working on established lines,insiders generally have a vested interest in perpetuating them.The professor who made his reputation by discovering some new ideais not likely to be the one to discover its replacement.  This isparticularly true with companies, who have not only skill and prideanchoring them to the status quo, but money as well. The Achillesheel of successful companies is their inability to cannibalizethemselves.  Many innovations consist of replacing something witha cheaper alternative, and companies just don\\'t want to see a pathwhose immediate effect is to cut an existing source of revenue.So if you\\'re an outsider you should actively seek out contrarianprojects.  Instead of working on things the eminent have madeprestigious, work on things that could steal that prestige.The really juicy new approaches are not the ones insiders rejectas impossible, but those they ignore as undignified.  For example,after Wozniak designed the Apple II he offered it first to hisemployer, HP.  They passed.  One of the reasons was that, to savemoney, he\\'d designed the Apple II to use a TV as a monitor, and HPfelt they couldn\\'t produce anything so declasse.LessWozniak used a TV as a monitor for the simple reason that he couldn\\'tafford a monitor.  Outsiders are not merely free but compelled tomake things that are cheap and lightweight.  And both are good betsfor growth: cheap things spread faster, and lightweight thingsevolve faster.The eminent, on the other hand, are almost forced to work on a largescale.  Instead of garden sheds they must design huge art museums.One reason they work on big things is that they can: like ourhypothetical novelist, they\\'re flattered by such opportunities.They also know that big projects will by their sheer bulk impressthe audience.  A garden shed, however lovely, would be easy toignore; a few might even snicker at it.  You can\\'t snicker at agiant museum, no matter how much you dislike it.  And finally, thereare all those people the eminent have working for them; they haveto choose projects that can keep them all busy.Outsiders are free of all this.  They can work on small things, andthere\\'s something very pleasing about small things.  Small thingscan be perfect; big ones always have something wrong with them.But there\\'s amagicin small things that goes beyond such rationalexplanations.  All kids know it.  Small things have more personality.Plus making them is more fun.  You can do what you want; you don\\'thave to satisfy committees.  And perhaps most important, smallthings can be done fast.  The prospect of seeing the finished projecthangs in the air like the smell of dinner cooking.  If you workfast, maybe you could have it done tonight.Working on small things is also a good way to learn.  The mostimportant kinds of learning happen one project at a time.  (\"Nexttime, I won\\'t...\")  The faster you cycle through projects, thefaster you\\'ll evolve.Plain materials have a charm like small scale.  And in additionthere\\'s the challenge of making do with less.  Every designer\\'sears perk up at the mention of that game, because it\\'s a game youcan\\'t lose.  Like the JV playing the varsity, if you even tie, youwin.  So paradoxically there are cases where fewer resources yieldbetter results, because the designers\\' pleasure at their own ingenuitymore than compensates.So if you\\'re an outsider, take advantage of your ability to makesmall and inexpensive things.  Cultivate the pleasure and simplicityof that kind of work; one day you\\'ll miss it.ResponsibilityWhen you\\'re old and eminent, what will you miss about being youngand obscure?  What people seem to miss most is the lack ofresponsibilities.Responsibility is an occupational disease of eminence.  In principleyou could avoid it, just as in principle you could avoid gettingfat as you get old, but few do.  I sometimes suspect that responsibilityis a trap and that the most virtuous route would be to shirk it,but regardless it\\'s certainly constraining.When you\\'re an outsider you\\'re constrained too, of course.  You\\'reshort of money, for example.  But that constrains you in differentways.  How does responsibility constrain you?  The worst thing isthat it allows you not to focus on real work.  Just as the mostdangerous forms ofprocrastinationare those that seem like work,the danger of responsibilities is not just that they can consume awhole day, but that they can do it without setting off thekind of alarms you\\'d set off if you spent a whole day sitting on apark bench.A lot of the pain of being an outsider is being aware of one\\'s ownprocrastination.  But this is actually a good thing.  You\\'re atleast close enough to work that the smell of it makes you hungry.As an outsider, you\\'re just one step away from getting things done.A huge step, admittedly, and one that most people never seem tomake, but only one step.  If you can summon up the energy to getstarted, you can work on projects with an intensity (in both senses)that few insiders can match.  For insiders work turns into a duty,laden with responsibilities and expectations.  It\\'s never so pureas it was when they were young.Work like a dog being taken for a walk, instead of an ox being yokedto the plow.  That\\'s what they miss.AudienceA lot of outsiders make the mistake of doing the opposite; theyadmire the eminent so much that they copy even their flaws.  Copyingis a good way to learn, but copy the right things.  When I was incollege I imitated the pompous diction of famous professors.  Butthis wasn\\'t whatmadethem eminent — it was more a flaw theireminence had allowed them to sink into.   Imitating it was likepretending to have gout in order to seem rich.Half the distinguishing qualities of the eminent are actuallydisadvantages.  Imitating these is not only a waste of time, butwill make you seem a fool to your models, who are often well awareof it.What are the genuine advantages of being an insider?  The greatestis an audience.  It often seems to outsiders that the great advantageof insiders is money — that they have the resources to do what theywant.  But so do people who inherit money, and that doesn\\'t seemto help, not as much as an audience.  It\\'s good for morale to knowpeople want to see what you\\'re making; it draws work out of you.If I\\'m right that the defining advantage of insiders is an audience,then we live in exciting times, because just in the last ten yearsthe Internet has made audiences a lot more liquid.  Outsiders don\\'thave to content themselves anymore with a proxy audience of a fewsmart friends.  Now, thanks to the Internet, they can start to growthemselves actual audiences.  This is great news for the marginal,who retain the advantages of outsiders while increasingly beingable to siphon off what had till recently been the prerogative ofthe elite.Though the Web has been around for more than ten years, I thinkwe\\'re just beginning to see its democratizing effects.  Outsidersare still learning how to steal audiences.  But more importantly,audiences are still learning how to be stolen — they\\'re still justbeginning to realize how muchdeeperbloggers can dig thanjournalists, how muchmore interestinga democratic news site can be than afront page controlled by editors, and how muchfunniera bunch of kidswith webcams can be than mass-produced sitcoms.The big media companies shouldn\\'t worry that people will post theircopyrighted material on YouTube.  They should worry that peoplewill post their own stuff on YouTube, and audiences will watch thatinstead.HackingIf I had to condense the power of the marginal into one sentenceit would be: just try hacking something together.  That phrase drawsin most threads I\\'ve mentioned here.   Hacking something togethermeans deciding what to do as you\\'re doing it, not a subordinateexecuting the vision of his boss.  It implies the result won\\'tbe pretty, because it will be made quickly out of inadequatematerials.  It may work, but it won\\'t be the sort of thing theeminent would want to put their name on.  Something hacked togethermeans something that barely solves the problem, or maybe doesn\\'tsolve the problem at all, but another you discovered en route.  Butthat\\'s ok, because the main value of that initial version is not thething itself, but what it leads to.  Insiders who daren\\'t walkthrough the mud in their nice clothes will never make it to thesolid ground on the other side.The word \"try\" is an especially valuable component.  I disagreehere with Yoda, who said there is no try.  There is try.  It impliesthere\\'s no punishment if you fail.  You\\'re driven by curiosityinstead of duty.  That means the wind of procrastination will bein your favor: instead of avoiding this work, this will be what youdo as a way of avoiding other work.  And when you do it, you\\'ll bein a better mood.  The more the work depends on imagination, themore that matters, because most people have more ideas when they\\'rehappy.If I could go back and redo my twenties, that would be one thingI\\'d do more of: just try hacking things together.  Like many peoplethat age, I spent a lot of time worrying about what I should do.I also spent some time trying to build stuff.  I should have spentless time worrying and more time building.  If you\\'re not sure whatto do, make something.Raymond Chandler\\'s advice to thriller writers was \"When in doubt,have a man come through a door with a gun in his hand.\"  He followedthat advice.  Judging from his books, he was often in doubt.  Butthough the result is occasionally cheesy, it\\'s never boring.  Inlife, as in books, action is underrated.Fortunately the number of things you can just hack together keepsincreasing.   People fifty years ago would be astonished that onecould just hack together a movie, for example.  Now you can evenhack together distribution.  Just make stuff and put it online.InappropriateIf you really want to score big, the place to focus is the marginof the margin: the territories only recently captured from theinsiders.  That\\'s where you\\'ll find the juiciest projects stillundone, either because they seemed too risky, or simply becausethere were too few insiders to explore everything.This is why I spend most of my time writingessayslately.  Thewriting of essays used to be limited to those who could get thempublished.  In principle you could have written them and just shownthem to your friends; in practice that didn\\'t work.Anessayist needs the resistance of an audience, just as an engraverneeds the resistance of the plate.Up till a few years ago, writing essays was the ultimate insider\\'sgame.  Domain experts were allowed to publish essays about theirfield, but the pool allowed to write on general topics was abouteight people who went to the right parties in New York.  Now thereconquista has overrun this territory, and, not surprisingly, foundit sparsely cultivated.  There are so many essays yet unwritten.They tend to be the naughtier ones; the insiders have pretty muchexhausted the motherhood and apple pie topics.This leads to my final suggestion: a technique for determining whenyou\\'re on the right track.  You\\'re on the right track when peoplecomplain that you\\'re unqualified, or that you\\'ve done somethinginappropriate.  If people are complaining, that means you\\'re doingsomething rather than sitting around, which is the first step.  Andif they\\'re driven to such empty forms of complaint, that meansyou\\'ve probably done something good.If you make something and people complain that it doesn\\'twork,that\\'s a problem.  But if the worst thing they can hit you with isyour own status as an outsider, that implies that in every otherrespect you\\'ve succeeded.  Pointing out that someone is unqualifiedis as desperate as resorting to racial slurs. It\\'s just a legitimatesounding way of saying: we don\\'t like your type around here.But the best thing of all is when people call what you\\'re doinginappropriate.  I\\'ve been hearing this word all my life and I onlyrecently realized that it is, in fact, the sound of the homingbeacon.  \"Inappropriate\" is the null criticism.  It\\'s merely theadjective form of \"I don\\'t like it.\"So that, I think, should be the highest goal for the marginal.  Beinappropriate.  When you hear people saying that, you\\'re golden.And they, incidentally, are busted.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': '\"The quantity of meaning compressed into a small space by algebraic signs, is another circumstance that facilitates the reasonings we are accustomed to carry on by their aid.\"- Charles Babbage, quoted in Iverson\\'s Turing Award LectureIn the discussion about issues raised byRevenge of the Nerdson the LL1 mailing list, Paul Prescod wrotesomething that stuck in my mind.Python\\'s goal is regularity and readability, not succinctness.On the face of it, this seems a rather damning thing to claim about a programming language.  As far as I can tell, succinctness = power.If so, then substituting, we getPython\\'s goal is regularity and readability, not power.and this doesn\\'t seem a tradeoff (if itisa tradeoff)that you\\'d want to make. It\\'s not far from saying that Python\\'s goal is not to be effective as a programming language.Does succinctness = power?  This seems to me an important question,maybe the most important question for anyone interested inlanguage design, and one that it would be useful to confrontdirectly.  I don\\'t feel sure yet that the answer is a simple yes, but it seems a good hypothesis to begin with.HypothesisMy hypothesis is that succinctness is power, or is close enoughthat except in pathological examples you can treat them as identical.It seems to me that succinctness is what programming languages arefor.Computers would be just as happy to be told what todo directly in machine language.  I think that the mainreason we take the trouble to develop high-level languages is toget leverage, so that we can say (and more importantly, think)in 10 lines of a high-level language what would require 1000lines of machine language.  In other words,the main point of high-level languages is to make source code smaller.If smaller source code is the purpose of high-level languages, andthe power of something is how well it achieves its purpose, thenthe measure of the power of a programming language is how small itmakes your programs.Conversely, a language that doesn\\'t make your programs small isdoing a bad job of what programming languages are supposed todo, like a knife that doesn\\'t cut well, or printing that\\'s illegible.MetricsSmall in what sense though?  The most common measure of code size islines of code.  But I think that this metric is the most common becauseit is the easiest to measure.  I don\\'t think anyone really believesit is the true test of the length of a program. Differentlanguages have different conventions for how much you should puton a line; in C a lot of lines have nothing on them but a delimiter or two.Another easy test is the number of characters in a program, but this is not very good either; some languages (Perl,for example) justuse shorter identifiers than others.I think a better measure of the size of a program would be the number of elements, where an element is anything thatwould be a distinct node if you drew a tree representing the source code. The name ofa variable or function is an element; an integer or a floating-point number is an element;a segment of literal text is an element;an element of a pattern, or a format directive, is an element;a new block is an element.  There are borderline cases(is -5 two elements or one?) but I think most of them are thesame for every language, so they don\\'t affect comparisons much.This metric needs fleshing out, andit could require interpretation in the case of specific languages,but I think it tries to measure the right thing, which is the number of parts a program has.  I think the tree you\\'d draw in thisexercise is what you have to make in your head in order toconceive of the program, and so its size is proportionate to theamount of work you have to do to write or read it.DesignThis kind of metric would allow us to compare different languages,but that is not, at least for me, its main value.  The main valueof the succinctness test is as a guide indesigninglanguages.The most useful comparison between languages is between twopotential variants of the same language.  What can I do in thelanguage to make programs shorter?If the conceptual load ofa program is proportionate to its complexity, and a given programmercan tolerate a fixed conceptual load, then this is the same as asking,what can I do to enable programmers to get the most done?  Andthat seems to me identical to asking, how can I design a goodlanguage?(Incidentally, nothing makes it more patently obvious that the oldchestnut \"all languages are equivalent\" is false than designinglanguages.  When you are designing a new language, you\\'reconstantlycomparing two languages-- the language if I did x, and if I didn\\'t-- todecide which is better.  If this were really a meaningless question,you might as well flip a coin.)Aiming for succinctness seems a good way to find new ideas.If you can do something that makes manydifferent programs shorter, it is probably not a coincidence: you have probably discovered a useful new abstraction.  You might even beable to write a program to help by searchingsource code for repeated patterns.  Among other languages, thosewith a reputation for succinctness would be the ones to look to fornew ideas: Forth, Joy, Icon.ComparisonThe first person to write about these issues, as far as I know, wasFred Brooks in theMythical Man Month.  He wrotethat programmers seemed to generate about the sameamount of code per day regardless of the language.When I first read this in my early twenties,it was a big surprise to me and seemed to have huge implications.It meant that (a) the only way to get software written faster was touse a more succinct language, and (b) someone who took thetrouble to do this could leave competitors who didn\\'t in the dust.Brooks\\' hypothesis, if it\\'s true, seems to be at the very heart of hacking.In the years since, I\\'ve paid close attention to any evidence I couldget on the question, from formal studies to anecdotes about individualprojects.   I have seen nothing to contradict him.I have not yet seen evidence that seemed to me conclusive,and I don\\'t expect to.  Studieslike Lutz Prechelt\\'s comparison of programming languages, whilegenerating the kind of results I expected, tend to use problems thatare too short to be meaningful tests.  A better test of a language iswhat happens in programs that take a month to write.  And the onlyreal test, if you believe as I do that the main purpose of a languageis to be good to think in (rather than just to tell a computer what todo once you\\'ve thought of it) is what new things you can write in it.So any language comparison whereyou have to meet a predefined spec is testing slightly the wrongthing.The true test of a language is how well you can discoverand solve new problems, nothow well you can use it to solve a problem someone else hasalready formulated.  These two are quite different criteria.In art, mediums like embroidery and mosaic work well if youknow beforehand what you want to make, but are absolutely lousy ifyou don\\'t.  When you want to discover the image as you make it--as you have to do with anything as complex as an image of aperson, for example-- you need to use a more fluid medium like pencil orink wash or oil paint.  And indeed, the way tapestries and mosaics are made inpractice is to make a painting first, then copy it.  (The word\"cartoon\" was originally used to describe a painting intended forthis purpose).What this means is that we are never likely to have accurate comparisonsof the relative power of programming languages.  We\\'ll have precisecomparisons, but not accurate ones.  In particular, explicit studiesfor the purpose of comparing languages,because they will probably use small problems, and will necessarily usepredefined problems, will tend to underestimate the power of themore powerful languages.Reports from the field, though they will necessarily be less precise than\"scientific\" studies, are likely to be more meaningful.  For example, Ulf Wiger of Ericsson did astudythat concluded that Erlang was 4-10xmore succinct than C++, and proportionately faster to develop software in:Comparisons between Ericsson-internal development projects indicatesimilar line/hour productivity, including all phases of software development,rather independently of which language (Erlang, PLEX, C, C++, or Java)was used.  What differentiates the different languages then becomes sourcecode volume.The study also deals explictly with a point that was only implicit in Brooks\\' book (since he measured lines of debugged code):programs written in more powerful languages tend to have fewer bugs.That becomes an end in itself, possibly more important than programmerproductivity, in applications like network switches.The Taste TestUltimately, I think you have to go with your gut.  What does it feellike to program in the language?  I think the way to find (or design)the best language is to become hypersensitive to how well a languagelets you think, then choose/design the language that feels best.  Ifsome language feature is awkward or restricting, don\\'t worry, you\\'llknow about it.Such hypersensitivity will come at a cost.  You\\'ll find that you can\\'tstandprogramming in clumsy languages.   I find it unbearablyrestrictive to program in languages without macros, just as someone usedto dynamic typing finds it unbearably restrictive to have to go back toprogramming in a language where you have to declare the type ofevery variable, and can\\'t make a list of objects of different types.I\\'m not the only one.  I know many Lisp hackers that this has happenedto.  In fact, the most accurate measure of the relative power of programminglanguages might be the percentage of people who know the languagewho will take any job where they get to use that language, regardlessof the application domain.RestrictivenessI think most hackers know what it means for a language to feel restrictive.What\\'s happening when you feel that?  I think it\\'s the same feelingyou get when the street you want to take is blocked off, and you have totake a long detour to get where you wanted to go.  There is somethingyou want to say, and the language won\\'t let you.What\\'s really going on here, I think, is that a restrictive language isone that isn\\'t succinct enough.  The problem is not simply that you can\\'tsay what you planned to.  It\\'s that the detour the language makes youtake islonger.Try this thought experiment.  Suppose there weresome program you wanted to write, and the language wouldn\\'t let youexpress it the way you planned to, but instead forced you to write theprogram in some other way that wasshorter.For me at least,that wouldn\\'t feel very restrictive.  It would be like the street youwanted to take being blocked off, and the policeman at the intersection directing you to a shortcut instead of a detour.  Great!I think most (ninety percent?) of the feeling of restrictiveness comes from being forced to make the programyou write in the language longer than one you have in your head.Restrictiveness is mostly lack of succinctness.So when a language feels restrictive, what that (mostly) means is that it isn\\'tsuccinct enough, and when a language isn\\'t succinct, it willfeel restrictive.ReadabilityThe quote I began with mentions two other qualities, regularity andreadability.  I\\'m not sure what regularity is, or what advantage, if any, code that is regular and readable has over code that is merelyreadable.  But I think I know what is meant by readability, and I thinkit is also related to succinctness.We have to be careful here to distinguish between the readability ofan individual line of code and the readability of the whole program.It\\'s the second that matters.  I agree that a line of Basic is likely to bemore readable than a line of Lisp.  But a program written in Basic isis going to have more lines than the same program written inLisp (especially once you cross over into Greenspunland). Thetotal effort of reading the Basic program will surely be greater.total effort  = effort per line x number of linesI\\'m not as sure that readability is directly proportionate to succinctnessas I am that power is, but certainly succinctness is a factor (in the mathematical sense; see equation above) in readability.So it may not even be meaningful to say that the goal of a language isreadability, not succinctness; it could be like saying the goal was readability,not readability.What readability-per-line does mean, to the user encountering the languagefor the first time, is that source code willlook unthreatening.  Soreadability-per-linecould be a good marketing decision, even if it is a bad designdecision.  It\\'s isomorphic to the very successful technique of lettingpeople pay in installments: instead of frightening them with a highupfront price, you tell them the low monthly payment.  Installment plansare a net lose for the buyer, though, as mere readability-per-line probablyis for the programmer.The buyer is going to make alotof those low, low payments; and the programmer is going to read alotof those individually readable lines.This tradeoff predates programming languages.  If you\\'re used to readingnovels and newspaper articles, your first experience of reading a mathpaper can be dismaying.  It could take half an hour to read a single page.  And yet, I am pretty sure that the notation is not the problem, even thoughit may feel like it is.  The math paper is hard to read because the ideas are hard.  If you expressed the same ideas in prose(as mathematicians had to do before they evolved succinct notations),they wouldn\\'t be any easier to read, because the paper would grow to thesize of a book.To What Extent?A number of people have rejectedthe idea that succinctness = power.  I think it would be more useful, insteadof simply arguing that they are the same or aren\\'t, to ask:to whatextentdoes succinctness = power?Because clearly succinctness isa large part of what higher-level languages are for.  If it is not all they\\'refor, then what else are they for, and how important, relatively, are theseother functions?I\\'m not proposing this just to make the debate more civilized.  I reallywant to know the answer.  When, if ever,  is a language too succinct for its own good?The hypothesis I began with was that, except in pathological examples,I thought succinctness could be considered identical with power.  WhatI meant was that in any language anyone would design, theywould be identical, but that if someone wanted to design a languageexplicitly to disprove this hypothesis, they could probably do it.  I\\'mnot even sure of that, actually.Languages, not ProgramsWe should be clear that we are talking about the succinctnessof languages, not of individual programs.It certainly is possible for individual programs to be written too densely.I wrote about this inOn Lisp. A complex macromay have to save many times its own length to be justified.  If writingsome hairy macro could save you ten lines of code every time you use it,and the macro is itself ten lines of code, then you get a net saving inlines if you use it more than once.  But that could still be a bad move,because macro definitions are harder to read than ordinary code.  You might have to use the macro ten or twenty times before it yielded a netimprovement in readability.I\\'m sure every language has such tradeoffs (though I suspect the stakesget higher as the language gets more powerful).  Every programmer musthave seen code that some clever person has made marginally shorterby using dubious programming tricks.So there is no argument about that-- at least, not from me.  Individualprograms can certainly be too succinct for their own good.  The questionis, can a language be?  Can a language compel programmers to writecode that\\'s short (in elements) at the expense of overall readability?One reason it\\'s hard to imagine a language being too succinct is that ifthere were some excessively compact way to phrase something, there wouldprobably also be a longer way.  For example, if you felt Lisp programs usinga lot of macros or higher-order functions were too dense,  you could, if youpreferred, write code that was isomorphic to Pascal.  If youdon\\'t want to express factorial in Arc as a call to a higher-order function(rec zero 1 * 1-)you can also write out a recursive definition:(rfn fact (x) (if (zero x) 1 (* x (fact (1- x)))))Though I can\\'t off the top of my head think of any examples, I am interestedin the question of whether a language could be too succinct.  Are there languages that force you to write code in a way that is crabbed and incomprehensible?If anyone has examples, I would be very interested to see them.(Reminder: What I\\'m looking for are programs that are very dense accordingto the metric of \"elements\" sketched above, not merely programs that areshort because delimiters can be omitted and everything has a one-character name.)Japanese TranslationRussian TranslationLutz Prechelt: Comparison of Seven LanguagesErann Gat: Lisp vs. JavaPeter Norvig Tries Prechelt\\'s TestMatthias Felleisen: Expressive Power of LanguagesKragen Sitaker: Redundancy and PowerForthJoyIconJK'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.October 2006In the Q & A period after a recent talk, someone asked what madestartups fail.  After standing there gaping for a few seconds Irealized this was kind of a trick question.  It\\'s equivalent toasking how to make a startup succeed — if you avoid every cause offailure, you succeed — and that\\'s too big a question to answer onthe fly.Afterwards I realized it could be helpful to look at the problemfrom this direction.  If you have a list of all the things youshouldn\\'t do, you can turn that into a recipe for succeeding justby negating.  And this form of list may be more useful in practice.It\\'s easier to catch yourself doing something you shouldn\\'t thanalways to remember to do something you should.In a sense there\\'s just one mistake that kills startups: not makingsomething users want.  If you make something users want, you\\'llprobably be fine, whatever else you do or don\\'t do.  And if youdon\\'t make something users want, then you\\'re dead, whatever elseyou do or don\\'t do.  So really this is a list of 18 things thatcause startups not to make something users want.  Nearly all failurefunnels through that.1. Single FounderHave you ever noticed how few successful startups were founded byjust one person?  Even companies you think of as having one founder,like Oracle, usually turn out to have more.  It seems unlikely thisis a coincidence.What\\'s wrong with having one founder?  To start with, it\\'s a voteof no confidence.  It probably means the founder couldn\\'t talk anyof his friends into starting the company with him.  That\\'s prettyalarming, because his friends are the ones who know him best.But even if the founder\\'s friends were all wrong and the companyis a good bet, he\\'s still at a disadvantage.  Starting a startupis too hard for one person.  Even if you could do all the workyourself, you need colleagues to brainstorm with, to talk you outof stupid decisions, and to cheer you up when things go wrong.The last one might be the most important.  The low points in astartup are so low that few could bear them alone.  When you havemultiple founders, esprit de corps binds them together in a waythat seems to violate conservation laws.  Each thinks \"I can\\'t letmy friends down.\"  This is one of the most powerful forces in humannature, and it\\'s missing when there\\'s just one founder.2. Bad LocationStartups prosper in some places and not others.  Silicon Valleydominates, then Boston, then Seattle, Austin, Denver, and New York.  Afterthat there\\'s not much.  Even in New York the number of startups percapita is probably a 20th of what it is in Silicon Valley.  In townslike Houston and Chicago and Detroit it\\'s too small to measure.Why is the falloff so sharp?  Probably for the same reason it isin other industries.  What\\'s the sixth largest fashion center inthe US?  The sixth largest center for oil, or finance, or publishing?Whatever they are they\\'re probably so far from the top that it wouldbe misleading even to call them centers.It\\'s an interesting question why citiesbecomestartup hubs, butthe reason startups prosper in them is probably the same as it isfor any industry: that\\'s where the experts are.  Standards arehigher; people are more sympathetic to what you\\'re doing; the kindof people you want to hire want to live there; supporting industriesare there; the people you run into in chance meetings are in thesame business.  Who knows exactly how these factors combine to booststartups in Silicon Valley and squish them in Detroit, but it\\'sclear they do from the number of startups per capita in each.3. Marginal NicheMost of the groups that apply to Y Combinator suffer from a commonproblem: choosing a small, obscure niche in the hope of avoidingcompetition.If you watch little kids playing sports, you notice that below acertain age they\\'re afraid of the ball.  When the ball comes nearthem their instinct is to avoid it.  I didn\\'t make a lot of catchesas an eight year old outfielder, because whenever a fly ball camemy way, I used to close my eyes and hold my glove up more forprotection than in the hope of catching it.Choosing a marginal project is the startup equivalent of my eightyear old strategy for dealing with fly balls.  If you make anythinggood, you\\'re going to have competitors, so you may as well facethat.  You can only avoid competition by avoiding good ideas.I think this shrinking from big problems is mostly unconscious.It\\'s not that people think of grand ideas but decide to pursuesmaller ones because they seem safer.  Your unconscious won\\'t evenlet you think of grand ideas.  So the solution may be to think aboutideas without involving yourself.  What would be a great idea forsomeone elseto do as a startup?4. Derivative IdeaMany of the applications we get are imitations of some existingcompany.  That\\'s one source of ideas, but not the best.  If youlook at the origins of successful startups, few were started inimitation of some other startup.  Where did they get their ideas?Usually from some specific, unsolved problem the founders identified.Our startup made software for making online stores.  When we startedit, there wasn\\'t any; the few sites you could order from werehand-made at great expense by web consultants.  We knew that ifonline shopping ever took off, these sites would have to be generatedby software, so we wrote some.  Pretty straightforward.It seems like the best problems to solve are ones that affect youpersonally.  Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a computer,Google because Larry and Sergey couldn\\'t find stuff online, Hotmailbecause Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith couldn\\'t exchange email atwork.So instead of copying the Facebook, with some variation that theFacebook rightly ignored, look for ideas from the other direction.Instead of starting from companies and working back to the problemsthey solved, look for problems and imagine the company that mightsolve them.What do people complain about?  What do you wish there was?5. ObstinacyIn some fields the way to succeed is to have a vision of what youwant to achieve, and to hold true to it no matter what setbacks youencounter.  Starting startups is not one of them.  The stick-to-your-visionapproach works for something like winning an Olympic gold medal,where the problem is well-defined.  Startups are more like science,where you need to follow the trail wherever it leads.So don\\'t get too attached to your original plan, because it\\'sprobably wrong.  Most successful startups end up doing somethingdifferent than they originally intended — often so different thatit doesn\\'t even seem like the same company.  You have to be preparedto see the better idea when it arrives.  And the hardest part ofthat is often discarding your old idea.But openness to new ideas has to be tuned just right.  Switchingto a new idea every week will be equally fatal.  Is there some kindof external test you can use?  One is to ask whether the ideasrepresent some kind of progression.  If in each new idea you\\'reable to re-use most of what you built for the previous ones, thenyou\\'re probably in a process that converges.  Whereas if you keeprestarting from scratch, that\\'s a bad sign.Fortunately there\\'s someone you can ask for advice: your users.  Ifyou\\'re thinking about turning in some new direction and your usersseem excited about it, it\\'s probably a good bet.6. Hiring Bad ProgrammersI forgot to include this in the early versions of the list,because nearly all the founders I know are programmers.  This isnot a serious problem for them.  They might accidentally hire someonebad, but it\\'s not going to kill the company.  In a pinch they cando whatever\\'s required themselves.But when I think about what killed most of the startups in thee-commerce business back in the 90s, it was bad programmers.  A lotof those companies were started by business guys who thought theway startups worked was that you had some clever idea and then hiredprogrammers to implement it.  That\\'s actually much harder than itsounds — almost impossibly hard in fact — because business guyscan\\'t tell which are the good programmers.  They don\\'t even get ashot at the best ones, because no one really good wants a jobimplementing the vision of a business guy.In practice what happens is that the business guys choose peoplethey think are good programmers (it says here on his resume thathe\\'s a Microsoft Certified Developer) but who aren\\'t.  Then they\\'remystified to find that their startup lumbers along like a World WarII bomber while their competitors scream past like jet fighters.This kind of startup is in the same position as a big company,but without the advantages.So how do you pick good programmers if you\\'re not a programmer?  Idon\\'t think there\\'s an answer.  I was about to say you\\'d have tofind a good programmer to help you hire people.  But if you can\\'trecognize good programmers, how would you even do that?7. Choosing the Wrong PlatformA related problem (since it tends to be done by bad programmers)is choosing the wrong platform.  For example, I think a lot ofstartups during the Bubble killed themselves by deciding to buildserver-based applications on Windows.  Hotmail was still runningon FreeBSD for years after Microsoft bought it, presumably becauseWindows couldn\\'t handle the load.  If Hotmail\\'s foundershad chosen to use Windows, they would have been swamped.PayPal only just dodged this bullet.  After they merged with X.com,the new CEO wanted to switch to Windows — even after PayPal cofounderMax Levchin showed that their software scaled only 1% as well onWindows as Unix.  Fortunately for PayPal they switched CEOs instead.Platform is a vague word.  It could mean an operating system, or aprogramming language, or a \"framework\" built on top of a programminglanguage.  It implies something that both supports and limits, likethe foundation of a house.The scary thing about platforms is that there are always some thatseem to outsiders to be fine, responsible choices and yet, likeWindows in the 90s, will destroy you if you choose them.  Javaapplets were probably the most spectacular example.  This wassupposed to be the new way of delivering applications.  Presumablyit killed just about 100% of the startups who believed that.How do you pick the right platforms?  The usual way is to hire goodprogrammers and let them choose.  But there is a trick you coulduse if you\\'re not a programmer: visit a top computer sciencedepartment and see what they use in research projects.8. Slowness in LaunchingCompanies of all sizes have a hard time getting software done.  It\\'sintrinsic to the medium; software is always 85% done.  It takes aneffort of will to push through this and get something released tousers.Startups make all kinds of excuses for delaying their launch.  Mostare equivalent to the ones people use for procrastinating in everydaylife.  There\\'s something that needs to happen first.  Maybe.  Butif the software were 100% finished and ready to launch at the pushof a button, would they still be waiting?One reason to launch quickly is that it forces you to actuallyfinishsome quantum of work.  Nothing is truly finished till it\\'sreleased; you can see that from the rush of work that\\'s alwaysinvolved in releasing anything, no matter how finished you thoughtit was.  The other reason you need to launch is that it\\'s only bybouncing your idea off users that you fully understand it.Several distinct problems manifest themselves as delays in launching:working too slowly; not truly understanding the problem; fear ofhaving to deal with users; fear of being judged; working on toomany different things; excessive perfectionism.  Fortunately youcan combat all of them by the simple expedient of forcing yourselfto launchsomethingfairly quickly.9. Launching Too EarlyLaunching too slowly has probably killed a hundred times morestartups than launching too fast, but it is possible to launch toofast.  The danger here is that you ruin your reputation.  You launchsomething, the early adopters try it out, and if it\\'s no good theymay never come back.So what\\'s the minimum you need to launch?  We suggest startups thinkabout what they plan to do, identify a core that\\'s both (a) usefulon its own and (b) something that can be incrementally expandedinto the whole project, and then get that done as soon as possible.This is the same approach I (and many other programmers) use forwriting software.  Think about the overall goal, then start bywriting the smallest subset of it that does anything useful.  Ifit\\'s a subset, you\\'ll have to write it anyway, so in the worst caseyou won\\'t be wasting your time.  But more likely you\\'ll find thatimplementing a working subset is both good for morale and helps yousee more clearly what the rest should do.The early adopters you need to impress are fairly tolerant.  Theydon\\'t expect a newly launched product to do everything; it just hasto dosomething.10. Having No Specific User in MindYou can\\'t build things users like without understanding them.  Imentioned earlier that the most successful startups seem to havebegun by trying to solve a problem their founders had.  Perhapsthere\\'s a rule here: perhaps you create wealth in proportion to howwell you understand the problem you\\'re solving, and the problemsyou understand best are your own.That\\'s just a theory.  What\\'s not a theory is the converse: ifyou\\'re trying to solve problems you don\\'t understand, you\\'re hosed.And yet a surprising number of founders seem willing toassume that someone, they\\'re not sure exactly who, will want whatthey\\'re building.  Do the founders want it?  No, they\\'re not thetarget market.  Who is?  Teenagers.  People interested in localevents (that one is a perennial tarpit).  Or \"business\" users.  Whatbusiness users?  Gas stations?  Movie studios?  Defense contractors?You can of course build something for users other than yourself.We did.  But you should realize you\\'re stepping into dangerousterritory.  You\\'re flying on instruments, in effect, so you should(a) consciously shift gears, instead of assuming you can rely onyour intuitions as you ordinarily would, and (b) look at theinstruments.In this case the instruments are the users.  When designing forother people you have to be empirical.  You can no longer guesswhat will work; you have to find users and measure their responses.So if you\\'re going to make something for teenagers or \"business\"users or some other group that doesn\\'t include you, you have to beable to talk some specific ones into using what you\\'re making.  Ifyou can\\'t, you\\'re on the wrong track.11. Raising Too Little MoneyMost successful startups take funding at some point.  Like havingmore than one founder, it seems a good bet statistically.  How muchshould you take, though?Startup funding is measured in time.  Every startup that isn\\'tprofitable (meaning nearly all of them, initially) has a certainamount of time left before the money runs out and they have to stop.This is sometimes referred to as runway, as in \"How much runway doyou have left?\"  It\\'s a good metaphor because it reminds you thatwhen the money runs out you\\'re going to be airborne or dead.Too little money means not enough to get airborne.  What airbornemeans depends on the situation.  Usually you have to advance to avisibly higher level: if all you have is an idea, a working prototype;if you have a prototype, launching; if you\\'re launched, significantgrowth.  It depends on investors, because until you\\'re profitablethat\\'s who you have to convince.So if you take money from investors, you have to take enough to getto the next step, whatever that is.Fortunately you have somecontrol over both how much you spend and what the next step is.  Weadvise startups to set both low, initially: spend practicallynothing, and make your initial goal simply to build a solid prototype.This gives you maximum flexibility.12. Spending Too MuchIt\\'s hard to distinguish spending too much from raising too little.If you run out of money, you could say either was the cause.  Theonly way to decide which to call it is by comparison with otherstartups.  If you raised five million and ran out of money, youprobably spent too much.Burning through too much money is not as common as it used to be.Founders seem to have learned that lesson.  Plus it keeps gettingcheaper to start a startup.  So as of this writing few startupsspend too much.  None of the ones we\\'ve funded have.  (And not justbecause we make small investments; many have gone on to raise furtherrounds.)The classic way to burn through cash is by hiring a lot of people.This bites you twice: in addition to increasing your costs, it slowsyou down—so money that\\'s getting consumed faster has to lastlonger.  Most hackers understand why that happens; Fred Brooksexplained it in The Mythical Man-Month.We have three general suggestions about hiring: (a) don\\'t do it ifyou can avoid it, (b) pay people with equity rather than salary,not just to save money, but because you want the kind of people whoare committed enough to prefer that, and (c) only hire people whoare either going to write code or go out and get users, becausethose are the only things you need at first.13. Raising Too Much MoneyIt\\'s obvious how too little money could kill you, but is there sucha thing as having too much?Yes and no.  The problem is not so much the money itself as whatcomes with it.  As one VC who spoke at Y Combinator said, \"Once youtake several million dollars of my money, the clock is ticking.\"If VCs fund you, they\\'re not going to let you just put the moneyin the bank and keep operating as two guys living on ramen.  Theywant that money to go to work.At the very least you\\'ll moveinto proper office space and hire more people.  That will changethe atmosphere, and not entirely for the better.  Now most of yourpeople will be employees rather than founders. They won\\'t be ascommitted; they\\'ll need to be told what to do; they\\'ll start toengage in office politics.When you raise a lot of money, your company moves to the suburbsand has kids.Perhaps more dangerously, once you take a lot of money it getsharder to change direction.  Suppose your initial plan was to sellsomething to companies.  After taking VC money you hire a salesforce to do that. What happens now if you realize you should bemaking this for consumers instead of businesses?  That\\'s a completelydifferent kind of selling.  What happens, in practice, is that youdon\\'t realize that.  The more people you have, the more you staypointed in the same direction.Another drawback of large investments is the time they take.  Thetime required to raise money grows with the amount.When theamount rises into the millions, investors get very cautious.  VCsnever quite say yes or no; they just engage you in an apparentlyendless conversation.  Raising VC scale investments is thus a hugetime sink — more work, probably, than the startup itself.   And youdon\\'t want to be spending all your time talking to investors whileyour competitors are spending theirs building things.We advise founders who go on to seek VC money to take the firstreasonable deal they get.  If you get an offer from a reputablefirm at a reasonable valuation with no unusually onerous terms,just take it and get on with building the company.Who caresif you could get a 30% better deal elsewhere?  Economically, startupsare an all-or-nothing game.  Bargain-hunting among investors is awaste of time.14. Poor Investor ManagementAs a founder, you have to manage your investors.  You shouldn\\'tignore them, because they may have useful insights.  But neithershould you let them run the company.  That\\'s supposed to be yourjob.  If investors had sufficient vision to run the companiesthey fund, why didn\\'t they start them?Pissing off investors by ignoring them is probably less dangerousthan caving in to them.  In our startup, we erred on the ignoringside.  A lot of our energy got drainedaway in disputes with investors instead of going into the product.But this was less costly than giving in, which would probably havedestroyed the company.  If the founders know what they\\'re doing,it\\'s better to have half their attention focused on the productthan the full attention of investors who don\\'t.How hard you have to work on managing investors usually depends onhow much money you\\'ve taken.  When you raise VC-scale money, theinvestors get a great deal of control.  If they have a board majority,they\\'re literally your bosses.  In the more common case, wherefounders and investors are equally represented and the decidingvote is cast by neutral outside directors, all the investors haveto do is convince the outside directors and they control the company.If things go well, this shouldn\\'t matter.  So long as you seem tobe advancing rapidly, most investors will leave you alone.  Butthings don\\'t always go smoothly in startups.  Investors have madetrouble even for the most successful companies.  One of the mostfamous examples is Apple, whose board made a nearly fatal blunderin firing Steve Jobs.  Apparently even Google got a lot of grieffrom their investors early on.15. Sacrificing Users to (Supposed) ProfitWhen I said at the beginning that if you make something users want,you\\'ll be fine, you may have noticed I didn\\'t mention anything abouthaving the right business model.  That\\'s not because making moneyis unimportant.  I\\'m not suggesting that founders start companieswith no chance of making money in the hope of unloading them beforethey tank.  The reason we tell founders not to worry about thebusiness model initially is that making something people want isso much harder.I don\\'t know why it\\'s so hard to make something people want.  Itseems like it should be straightforward.  But you can tell it mustbe hard by how few startups do it.Because making something people want is so much harder than makingmoney from it, you should leave business models for later, just asyou\\'d leave some trivial but messy feature for version 2.  In version1, solve the core problem.  And the core problem in a startup ishow tocreate wealth(= how much people want something x the numberwho want it), not how to convert that wealth into money.The companies that win are the ones that put users first.  Google,for example.  They made search work, then worried about how to makemoney from it.  And yet some startup founders still think it\\'sirresponsible not to focus on the business model from the beginning.They\\'re often encouraged in this by investors whose experience comesfrom less malleable industries.Itisirresponsible not to think about business models.  It\\'sjust ten times more irresponsible not to think about the product.16. Not Wanting to Get Your Hands DirtyNearly all programmers would rather spend their time writing codeand have someone else handle the messy business of extracting moneyfrom it.  And not just the lazy ones.  Larry and Sergey apparentlyfelt this way too at first.  After developing their new searchalgorithm, the first thing they tried was to get some other companyto buy it.Start a company?  Yech.  Most hackers would rather just have ideas.But as Larry and Sergey found, there\\'s not much of a market forideas.  No one trusts an idea till you embody it in a product anduse that to grow a user base.  Then they\\'ll pay big time.Maybe this will change, but I doubt it will change much.  There\\'snothing like users for convincing acquirers.  It\\'s not just thatthe risk is decreased.  The acquirers are human, and they have ahard time paying a bunch of young guys millions of dollars just forbeing clever.  When the idea is embodied in a company with a lotof users, they can tell themselves they\\'re buying the users ratherthan the cleverness, and this is easier for them to swallow.If you\\'re going to attract users, you\\'ll probably have to get upfrom your computer and go find some.  It\\'s unpleasant work, but ifyou can make yourself do it you have a much greater chance ofsucceeding.  In the first batch of startups we funded, in the summerof 2005, most of the founders spent all their time building theirapplications.  But there was one who was away half the time talkingto executives at cell phone companies, trying to arrange deals.Can you imagine anything more painful for a hacker?But itpaid off, because this startup seems the most successful of thatgroup by an order of magnitude.If you want to start a startup, you have to face the fact that youcan\\'t just hack.  At least one hacker will have to spend some ofthe time doing business stuff.17. Fights Between FoundersFights between founders are surprisingly common.  About 20% of thestartups we\\'ve funded have had a founder leave.  It happens so oftenthat we\\'ve reversed our attitude to vesting.  We still don\\'t requireit, but now we advise founders to vest so there will be an orderlyway for people to quit.A founder leaving doesn\\'t necessarily kill a startup, though.  Plentyof successful startups have had that happen.Fortunately it\\'susually the least committed founder who leaves.  If there are threefounders and one who was lukewarm leaves, big deal.  If you havetwo and one leaves, or a guy with critical technical skills leaves,that\\'s more of a problem.  But even that is survivable.  Bloggergot down to one person, and they bounced back.Most of the disputes I\\'ve seen between founders could have beenavoided if they\\'d been more careful about who they started a companywith.  Most disputes are not due to the situation but the people.Which means they\\'re inevitable.  And most founders who\\'ve beenburned by such disputes probably had misgivings, which they suppressed,when they started the company.  Don\\'t suppress misgivings.  It\\'smuch easier to fix problems before the company is started thanafter.  So don\\'t include your housemate in your startup becausehe\\'d feel left out otherwise.  Don\\'t start a company with someoneyou dislike because they have some skill you need and you worry youwon\\'t find anyone else.  The people are the most important ingredientin a startup, so don\\'t compromise there.18. A Half-Hearted EffortThe failed startups you hear most about are the spectacularflameouts.  Those are actually the elite of failures.  The mostcommon type is not the one that makes spectacular mistakes, but theone that doesn\\'t do much of anything — the one we never even hearabout, because it was some project a couple guys started on theside while working on their day jobs, but which never got anywhereand was gradually abandoned.Statistically, if you want to avoid failure, it would seem like themost important thing is to quit your day job.  Most founders offailed startups don\\'t quit their day jobs, and most founders ofsuccessful ones do.  If startup failure were a disease, the CDCwould be issuing bulletins warning people to avoid day jobs.Does that mean you should quit your day job?  Not necessarily.  I\\'mguessing here, but I\\'d guess that many of these would-be foundersmay not have the kind of determination it takes to start a company,and that in the back of their minds, they know it.  The reason theydon\\'t invest more time in their startup is that they know it\\'s abad investment.I\\'d also guess there\\'s some band of people who could have succeededif they\\'d taken the leap and done it full-time, but didn\\'t. I haveno idea how wide this band is, but if the winner/borderline/hopelessprogression has the sort of distribution you\\'d expect, the numberof people who could have made it, if they\\'d quit their day job, isprobably an order of magnitude larger than the number who do makeit.If that\\'s true, most startups that could succeed fail because thefounders don\\'t devote their whole efforts to them.  That certainlyaccords with what I see out in the world.  Most startups fail becausethey don\\'t make something people want, and the reason most don\\'tis that they don\\'t try hard enough.In other words, starting startups is just like everything else.The biggest mistake you can make is not to try hard enough.  To theextent there\\'s a secret to success, it\\'s not to be in denial aboutthat.'},\n",
       " {'title': \"What I've Learned from Users\",\n",
       "  'date': 'September 2022',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'I recently told applicants to Y Combinator that the best advice Icould give for getting in, per word, wasExplain what you\\'ve learned from users.That tests a lot of things: whether you\\'re paying attention tousers, how well you understand them, and even how much they needwhat you\\'re making.Afterward I asked myself the same question. What have I learnedfrom YC\\'s users, the startups we\\'ve funded?The first thing that came to mind was that most startups have thesame problems. No two have exactly the same problems, but it\\'ssurprising how much the problems remain the same, regardless ofwhat they\\'re making. Once you\\'ve advised 100 startups all doingdifferent things, you rarely encounter problems you haven\\'t seenbefore.This fact is one of the things that makes YC work. But I didn\\'tknow it when we started YC. I only had a few data points: our ownstartup, and those started by friends. It was a surprise to me howoften the same problems recur in different forms. Many later stageinvestors might never realize this, because later stage investorsmight not advise 100 startups in their whole career, but a YC partnerwill get this much experience in the first year or two.That\\'s one advantage of funding large numbers of early stage companiesrather than smaller numbers of later-stage ones. You get a lot ofdata. Not just because you\\'re looking at more companies, but alsobecause more goes wrong.But knowing (nearly) all the problems startups can encounter doesn\\'tmean that advising them can be automated, or reduced to a formula.There\\'s no substitute for individual office hours with a YC partner.Each startup is unique, which means they have to be advisedby specific partners who know them well.We learned that the hard way, in the notorious \"batch that brokeYC\" in the summer of 2012. Up till that point we treated the partnersas a pool. When a startup requested office hours, they got the nextavailable slot posted by any partner. That meant every partner hadto know every startup. This worked fine up to 60 startups, but whenthe batch grew to 80, everything broke. The founders probably didn\\'trealize anything was wrong, but the partners were confused andunhappy because halfway through the batch they still didn\\'t knowall the companies yet.At first I was puzzled. How could things be fine at 60 startups andbroken at 80? It was only a third more. Then I realized what hadhappened. We were using anO(n2)algorithm. So of course it blewup.The solution we adopted was the classic one in these situations.We sharded the batch into smaller groups of startups, each overseenby a dedicated group of partners. That fixed the problem, and hasworked fine ever since. But the batch that broke YC was a powerfuldemonstration of how individualized the process of advising startupshas to be.Another related surprise is how bad founders can be at realizingwhat their problems are. Founders will sometimes come in to talkabout some problem, and we\\'ll discover another much bigger one inthe course of the conversation. For example (and this case is alltoo common), founders will come in to talk about the difficultiesthey\\'re having raising money, and after digging into their situation,it turns out the reason is that the company is doing badly, andinvestors can tell. Or founders will come in worried that they stillhaven\\'t cracked the problem of user acquisition, and the reason turns outto be that their product isn\\'t good enough. There have been timeswhen I\\'ve asked \"Would you use this yourself, if you hadn\\'t builtit?\" and the founders, on thinking about it, said \"No.\" Well, there\\'sthe reason you\\'re having trouble getting users.Often founders know what their problems are, but not their relativeimportance.They\\'ll come in to talk about three problemsthey\\'re worrying about. One is of moderate importance, one doesn\\'tmatter at all, and one will kill the company if it isn\\'t addressedimmediately. It\\'s like watching one of those horror movies wherethe heroine is deeply upset that her boyfriend cheated on her, andonly mildly curious about the door that\\'s mysteriously ajar. Youwant to say: never mind about your boyfriend, think about that door!Fortunately in office hours you can. So while startups still diewith some regularity, it\\'s rarely because they wandered into a roomcontaining a murderer. The YC partners can warn them where themurderers are.Not that founders listen. That was another big surprise: how oftenfounders don\\'t listen to us. A couple weeks ago I talked to a partnerwho had been working for YC for a couple batches and was startingto see the pattern. \"They come back a year later,\" she said, \"andsay \\'We wish we\\'d listened to you.\\'\"It took me a long time to figure out why founders don\\'t listen. Atfirst I thought it was mere stubbornness. That\\'s part of the reason,but another and probably more important reason is that so much aboutstartups iscounterintuitive. And when you tell someone somethingcounterintuitive, what it sounds to them is wrong. So the reasonfounders don\\'t listen to us is that they don\\'tbelieveus. Atleast not till experience teaches them otherwise.The reason startups are so counterintuitive is that they\\'re sodifferent from most people\\'s other experiences. No one knows whatit\\'s like except those who\\'ve done it. Which is why YC partnersshould usually have been founders themselves. But strangely enough,the counterintuitiveness of startups turns out to be another of thethings that make YC work. If it weren\\'t counterintuitive, founderswouldn\\'t need our advice about how to do it.Focus is doubly important for early stage startups, because notonly do they have a hundred different problems, they don\\'t haveanyone to work on them except the founders. If the founders focuson things that don\\'t matter, there\\'s no one focusing on the thingsthat do. So the essence of what happens at YC is to figure out whichproblems matter most, then cook up ideas for solving them — ideallyat a resolution of a week or less — and then try those ideas andmeasure how well they worked. The focus is on action, with measurable,near-term results.This doesn\\'t imply that founders should rush forward regardless ofthe consequences. If you correct course at a high enough frequency,you can be simultaneously decisive at a micro scale and tentativeat a macro scale. The result is a somewhat winding path, but executedvery rapidly, like the path a running back takes downfield. And inpractice there\\'s less backtracking than you might expect. Foundersusually guess right about which direction to run in, especially ifthey have someone experienced like a YC partner to bounce theirhypotheses off. And when they guess wrong, they notice fast, becausethey\\'ll talk about the results at office hours the next week.A small improvement in navigational ability can make you a lotfaster, because it has a double effect: the path is shorter, andyou can travel faster along it when you\\'re more certain it\\'s theright one. That\\'s where a lot of YC\\'s value lies, in helping foundersget an extra increment of focus that lets them move faster. Andsince moving fast is the essence of a startup, YC in effect makesstartups more startup-like.Speed defines startups. Focus enables speed. YC improves focus.Why are founders uncertain about what to do? Partly because startupsalmost by definition are doing something new, which means no oneknows how to do it yet, or in most cases even what \"it\" is. Partlybecause startups are so counterintuitive generally. And partlybecause many founders, especially young and ambitious ones, havebeen trained to win the wrong way. That took me years to figureout. The educational system in most countries trains you to win byhacking the testinstead of actually doing whatever it\\'s supposedto measure. But that stops working when you start a startup. Sopart of what YC does is to retrain founders to stop trying to hackthe test. (It takes a surprisingly long time. A year in, you stillsee them reverting to their old habits.)YC is not simply more experienced founders passing on their knowledge.It\\'s more like specialization than apprenticeship. The knowledgeof the YC partners and the founders have different shapes: Itwouldn\\'t be worthwhile for a founder to acquire the encyclopedicknowledge of startup problems that a YC partner has, just as itwouldn\\'t be worthwhile for a YC partner to acquire the depth ofdomain knowledge that a founder has. That\\'s why it can still bevaluable for an experienced founder to do YC, just as it can stillbe valuable for an experienced athlete to have a coach.The other big thing YC gives founders is colleagues, and this maybe even more important than the advice of partners. If you look athistory, great work clusters around certain places and institutions:Florence in the late 15th century, the University of Göttingen inthe late 19th,The New Yorkerunder Ross, Bell Labs, Xerox PARC.However good you are, good colleagues make you better. Indeed, veryambitious people probably need colleagues more than anyone else,because they\\'re so starved for them in everyday life.Whether or not YC manages one day to be listed alongside thosefamous clusters, it won\\'t be for lack of trying. We were very awareof this historical phenomenon and deliberately designed YC to beone. By this point it\\'s not bragging to say that it\\'s the biggestcluster of great startup founders. Even people trying to attack YCconcede that.Colleagues and startup founders are two of the most powerful forcesin the world, so you\\'d expect it to have a big effect to combinethem. Before YC, to the extent people thought about the questionat all, most assumed they couldn\\'t be combined — that lonelinesswas the price of independence. That was how it felt to us when westarted our own startup in Boston in the 1990s. We had a handfulof older people we could go to for advice (of varying quality), butno peers. There was no one we could commiserate with about themisbehavior of investors, or speculate with about the future oftechnology. I often tell founders to make something they themselveswant, and YC is certainly that: it was designed to be exactly whatwe wanted when we were starting a startup.One thing we wanted was to be able to get seed funding withouthaving to make the rounds of random rich people. That has become acommodity now, at least in the US. But great colleagues can neverbecome a commodity, because the fact that they cluster in someplaces means they\\'re proportionally absent from the rest.Something magical happens where they do cluster though. The energyin the room at a YC dinner is like nothing else I\\'ve experienced.We would have been happy just to have one or two other startups totalk to. When you have a whole roomful it\\'s another thing entirely.YC founders aren\\'t just inspired by one another. They also help oneanother. That\\'s the happiest thing I\\'ve learned about startupfounders: how generous they can be in helping one another. We noticedthis in the first batch and consciously designed YC to magnify it.The result is something far more intense than, say, a university.Between the partners, the alumni, and their batchmates, foundersare surrounded by people who want to help them, and can.'},\n",

       "  'date': '\"...the mere consciousness of an engagement will sometimes worry a whole day.\"',\n",
       "  'essay_text': '– Charles DickensJuly 2009One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they\\'re ona different type of schedule from other people.  Meetings cost themmore.There are two types of schedule, which I\\'ll call the manager\\'sschedule and the maker\\'s schedule.  The manager\\'s schedule is forbosses.  It\\'s embodied in the traditional appointment book, witheach day cut into one hour intervals.  You can block off severalhours for a single task if you need to, but by default you changewhat you\\'re doing every hour.When you use time that way, it\\'s merely a practical problem to meetwith someone.  Find an open slot in your schedule, book them, andyou\\'re done.Most powerful people are on the manager\\'s schedule.  It\\'s theschedule of command.  But there\\'s another way of using time that\\'scommon among people who make things, like programmers and writers.They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least.You can\\'t write or program well in units of an hour.  That\\'s barelyenough time to get started.When you\\'re operating on the maker\\'s schedule, meetings are adisaster.  A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breakingit into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in.  Plus youhave to remember to go to the meeting.  That\\'s no problem for someoneon the manager\\'s schedule.  There\\'s always something coming on thenext hour; the only question is what.  But when someone on themaker\\'s schedule has a meeting, they have to think about it.For someone on the maker\\'s schedule, having a meeting is likethrowing an exception.  It doesn\\'t merely cause you to switch fromone task to another; it changes the mode in which you work.I find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole day.   A meetingcommonly blows at least half a day, by breaking up a morning orafternoon.  But in addition there\\'s sometimes a cascading effect.If I know the afternoon is going to be broken up, I\\'m slightly lesslikely to start something ambitious in the morning.  I know thismay sound oversensitive, but if you\\'re a maker, think of your owncase.  Don\\'t your spirits rise at the thought of having an entireday free to work, with no appointments at all?  Well, that meansyour spirits are correspondingly depressed when you don\\'t.  Andambitious projects are by definition close to the limits of yourcapacity.  A small decrease in morale is enough to kill them off.Each type of schedule works fine by itself.  Problems arise whenthey meet.  Since most powerful people operate on the manager\\'sschedule, they\\'re in a position to make everyone resonate at theirfrequency if they want to.  But the smarter ones restrain themselves,if they know that some of the people working for them need longchunks of time to work in.Our case is an unusual one.  Nearly all investors, including allVCs I know, operate on the manager\\'s schedule.  ButY Combinatorruns on the maker\\'s schedule.  Rtm and Trevor and I do because wealways have, and Jessica does too, mostly, because she\\'s gotteninto sync with us.I wouldn\\'t be surprised if there start to be more companies likeus.  I suspect founders may increasingly be able to resist, or atleast postpone, turning into managers, just as a few decades agothey started to be able to resist switching from jeansto suits.How do we manage to advise so many startups on the maker\\'s schedule?By using the classic device for simulating the manager\\'s schedulewithin the maker\\'s: office hours.  Several times a week I set asidea chunk of time to meet founders we\\'ve funded.  These chunks oftime are at the end of my working day, and I wrote a signup programthat ensures all the appointments within a given set of office hoursare clustered at the end.  Because they come at the end of my daythese meetings are never an interruption.  (Unless their workingday ends at the same time as mine, the meeting presumably interruptstheirs, but since they made the appointment it must be worth it tothem.)  During busy periods, office hours sometimes get long enoughthat they compress the day, but they never interrupt it.When we were working onour own startup, back in the 90s, I evolvedanother trick for partitioning the day.  I used to program fromdinner till about 3 am every day, because at night no one couldinterrupt me.  Then I\\'d sleep till about 11 am, and come in andwork until dinner on what I called \"business stuff.\"  I never thoughtof it in these terms, but in effect I had two workdays each day,one on the manager\\'s schedule and one on the maker\\'s.When you\\'re operating on the manager\\'s schedule you can do somethingyou\\'d never want to do on the maker\\'s: you can have speculativemeetings.  You can meet someone just to get to know one another.If you have an empty slot in your schedule, why not?  Maybe it willturn out you can help one another in some way.Business people in Silicon Valley (and the whole world, for thatmatter) have speculative meetings all the time.  They\\'re effectivelyfree if you\\'re on the manager\\'s schedule.  They\\'re so common thatthere\\'s distinctive language for proposing them: saying that youwant to \"grab coffee,\" for example.Speculative meetings are terribly costly if you\\'re on the maker\\'sschedule, though.  Which puts us in something of a bind.  Everyoneassumes that, like other investors, we run on the manager\\'s schedule.So they introduce us to someone they think we ought to meet, orsend us an email proposing we grab coffee.  At this point we havetwo options, neither of them good: we can meet with them, and losehalf a day\\'s work; or we can try to avoid meeting them, and probablyoffend them.Till recently we weren\\'t clear in our own minds about the sourceof the problem.  We just took it for granted that we had to eitherblow our schedules or offend people.  But now that I\\'ve realizedwhat\\'s going on, perhaps there\\'s a third option: to write somethingexplaining the two types of schedule.  Maybe eventually, if theconflict between the manager\\'s schedule and the maker\\'s schedulestarts to be more widely understood, it will become less of aproblem.Those of us on the maker\\'s schedule are willing to compromise.   Weknow we have to have some number of meetings.  All we ask from thoseon the manager\\'s schedule is that they understand the cost.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': \"Recently I realized I'd been holding two ideas in my head that would explode if combined.The first is that startups may represent anew economic phase, on the scale of the Industrial Revolution. I'm not sure of this, but there seems a decent chance it's true.  People are dramatically moreproductiveas founders or early employees of startups—imagine how much less Larry and Sergey would have achieved if they'd gone to work for a big company—and that scale of improvement can change social customs.The second idea is that startups are a type of business that flourishes in certain places thatspecializein it—that Silicon Valley specializes in startups in the same way Los Angeles specializes in movies, or New York in finance.What if both are true?  What if startups are both a new economic phase and also a type of business that only flourishes in certain centers?If so, this revolution is going to be particularly revolutionary. All previous revolutions have spread.  Agriculture, cities, and industrialization all spread widely. If startups end up being like the movie business, with just a handful of centers and one dominant one, that's going to have novel consequences.There are already signs that startups may not spread particularly well.  The spread of startups seems to be proceeding slower than the spread of the Industrial Revolution, despite the fact that communication is so much faster now.Within a few decades of the founding of Boulton & Watt there were steam engines scattered over northern Europe and North America.  Industrialization didn't spread much beyond those regions for a while. It only spread to places where there was a strong middle class—countries where a private citizen could make a fortune without having it confiscated. Otherwise it wasn't worth investing in factories.  But in a country with a strong middle class it was easy for industrial techniques to take root.  An individual mine or factory owner could decide to install a steam engine, and within a few years he could probably find someone local to make him one.  So steam engines spread fast.  And they spread widely, because the locations of mines and factories were determined by features like rivers, harbors, and sources of raw materials.Startups don't seem to spread so well, partly because they're more a social than a technical phenomenon, and partly because they're not tied to geography.  An individual European manufacturer could import industrial techniques and they'd work fine.  This doesn't seem to work so well with startups: you need a community of expertise, as you do in the movie business.Plus there aren't the same forces driving startups to spread.  Once railroads or electric power grids were invented, every region had to have them.  An area without railroads or power was a rich potential market.  But this isn't true with startups.  There's no need for a Microsoft of France or Google of Germany.Governments may decide they want to encourage startups locally, but government policy can't call them into being the way a genuine need could.How will this all play out?  If I had to predict now, I'd say that startups will spread, but very slowly, because their spread will be driven not by government policies (which won't work) or by market need (which doesn't exist) but, to the extent that it happens at all, by the same random factors that have caused startup culture to spread thus far.  And such random factors will increasingly be outweighed by the pull of existing startup hubs.Silicon Valley is where it is because William Shockley wanted to move back to Palo Alto, where he grew up, and the experts he lured west to work with him liked it so much they stayed.  Seattle owes much of its position as a tech center to the same cause: Gates and Allen wanted to move home.  Otherwise Albuquerque might have Seattle's place in the rankings.  Boston is a tech center because it's the intellectual capital of the US and probably the world.  And if Battery Ventures hadn't turned down Facebook, Boston would be significantly bigger now on the startup radar screen.But of course it's not a coincidence that Facebook got funded in the Valley and not Boston.  There are more and bolder investors in Silicon Valley than in Boston, and even undergrads know it.Boston's case illustrates the difficulty you'd have establishing a new startup hub this late in the game.  If you wanted to create a startup hub by reproducing the way existing ones happened, theway to do itwould be to establish a first-rate research university in a place so nice that rich people wanted to live there.  Then the town would be hospitable to both groups you need: both founders and investors.  That's the combination that yielded Silicon Valley.  But Silicon Valley didn't have Silicon Valley to compete with.  If you tried now to create a startup hub by planting a great university in a nice place, it would have a harder time getting started, because many of the best startups it produced would be sucked away to existing startup hubs.Recently I suggested a potential shortcut:pay startups to move.  Once you had enough good startups in one place, it would create a self-sustaining chain reaction.  Founders would start to move there without being paid, because that was where their peers were, and investors would appear too, because that was where the deals were.In practice I doubt any government would have the balls to try this, or the brains to do it right.  I didn't mean it as a practical suggestion, but more as an exploration of the lower bound of what it would take to create a startup hub deliberately.The most likely scenario is (1) that no government will successfully establish a startup hub, and (2) that the spread of startup culture will thus be driven by the random factors that have driven it so far, but (3) that these factors will be increasingly outweighed by the pull of existing startup hubs.  Result: this revolution, if it is one, will be unusually localized.\"},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'What hard liquor, cigarettes, heroin, and crack have in common isthat they\\'re all more concentrated forms of less addictive predecessors.Most if not all the things we describe as addictive are.  And thescary thing is, the process that created them is accelerating.We wouldn\\'t want to stop it.  It\\'s the same process that curesdiseases: technological progress.  Technological progress meansmaking things do more of what we want.  When the thing we want issomething we want to want, we consider technological progress good.If some new technique makes solar cells x% more efficient, thatseems strictly better.  When progress concentrates something wedon\\'t want to want — when it transforms opium into heroin — it seemsbad.  But it\\'s the same process at work.No one doubts this process is accelerating, which means increasingnumbers of things we like will be transformed into things we liketoo much.As far as I know there\\'s no word for something we like too much.The closest is the colloquial sense of \"addictive.\" That usage hasbecome increasingly common during my lifetime. And it\\'s clear why:there are an increasing number of things we need it for. At theextreme end of the spectrum are crack and meth. Food has beentransformed by a combination of factory farming and innovations infood processing into something with way more immediate bang for thebuck, and you can see the results in any town in America. Checkersand solitaire have been replaced by World of Warcraft and FarmVille.TV has become much more engaging, and even so itcan\\'t competewith Facebook.The world is more addictive than it was 40 years ago.   And unlessthe forms of technological progress that produced these things aresubject to different laws than technological progress in general,the world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than it didin the last 40.The next 40 years will bring us some wonderful things.  I don\\'tmean to imply they\\'re all to be avoided.  Alcohol is a dangerousdrug, but I\\'d rather live in a world with wine than one without.Most people can coexist with alcohol; but you have to be careful.More things we like will mean more things we have to be carefulabout.Most people won\\'t, unfortunately.  Which means that as the worldbecomes more addictive, the two senses in which one can live anormal life will be driven ever further apart.  One sense of \"normal\"is statistically normal: what everyone else does.  The other is thesense we mean when we talk about the normal operating range of apiece of machinery: what works best.These two senses are already quite far apart.  Already someonetrying to live well would seem eccentrically abstemious in most ofthe US.  That phenomenon is only going to become more pronounced.You can probably take it as a rule of thumb from now on that ifpeople don\\'t think you\\'re weird, you\\'re living badly.Societies eventually develop antibodies to addictive new things.I\\'ve seen that happen with cigarettes.  When cigarettes firstappeared, they spread the way an infectious disease spreads througha previously isolated population.  Smoking rapidly became a(statistically) normal thing.  There were ashtrays everywhere.  Wehad ashtrays in our house when I was a kid, even though neither ofmy parents smoked.  You had to for guests.As knowledge spread about the dangers of smoking, customs changed.In the last 20 years, smoking has been transformed from somethingthat seemed totally normal into a rather seedy habit: from somethingmovie stars did in publicity shots to something small huddles ofaddicts do outside the doors of office buildings.  A lot of thechange was due to legislation, of course, but the legislationcouldn\\'t have happened if customs hadn\\'t already changed.It took a while though—on the order of 100 years.  And unless therate at which social antibodies evolve can increase to match theaccelerating rate at which technological progress throws off newaddictions, we\\'ll be increasingly unable to rely on customs toprotect us.Unless we want to be canaries in the coal mineof each new addiction—the people whose sad example becomes alesson to future generations—we\\'ll have to figure out for ourselveswhat to avoid and how.  It will actually become a reasonable strategy(or a more reasonable strategy) to suspecteverything new.In fact, even that won\\'t be enough.  We\\'ll have to worry not justabout new things, but also about existing things becoming moreaddictive.  That\\'s what bit me.  I\\'ve avoided most addictions, butthe Internet got me because it became addictive while I was usingit.Most people I know have problems with Internet addiction.  We\\'reall trying to figure out our own customs for getting free of it.That\\'s why I don\\'t have an iPhone, for example; the last thing Iwant is for the Internet to follow me out into the world.My latest trick is taking long hikes.  I used to think running was abetter form of exercise than hiking because it took less time.  Nowthe slowness of hiking seems an advantage, because the longer Ispend on the trail, the longer I have to think without interruption.Sounds pretty eccentric, doesn\\'t it?  It always will when you\\'retrying to solve problems where there are no customs yet to guideyou.  Maybe I can\\'t plead Occam\\'s razor; maybe I\\'m simply eccentric.But if I\\'m right about the acceleration of addictiveness, then thiskind of lonely squirming to avoid it will increasingly be the fateof anyone who wants to get things done.

Violatingmoral fashions can get you fired, ostracized, imprisoned, oreven killed.If you could travel back in a time machine, one thingwould be true no matter where you went: you\\'d have to watchwhat you said.  Opinions we consider harmless could have gotten you in big trouble.I\\'ve already said at least one thing that would have gotten me in bigtrouble in most of Europe in the seventeenth century,and did get Galileo in big trouble when he saidit — that the earth moves. [1]It seems to be a constant throughout history: In everyperiod, people believed things that were just ridiculous,and believed them so strongly that you would have gotten interrible trouble for saying otherwise.Is our time any different?To anyone who has read any amount of history, the answer isalmost certainly no.   It would be a remarkable coincidence if ourswere the first era to get everything just right.It\\'s tantalizing to think we believethings that people in the future will find ridiculous.Whatwouldsomeone coming back to visit us in a time machinehave to be careful not to say?That\\'s what I want to study here.ButI want to do more than just shock everyone withthe heresy du jour.  I want to find generalrecipes for discovering what you can\\'t say, in any era.The Conformist TestLet\\'s start with a test:  Do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to expressin front of a group of your peers?If the answer is no,you might want to stop and think about that.  If everythingyou believe is something you\\'re supposed to believe, couldthat possibly be a coincidence?  Odds are it isn\\'t.  Odds areyou just think whatyou\\'re told.The other alternative would be that you independently consideredevery question and came up with the exact same answers thatare now considered acceptable.  That seems unlikely, becauseyou\\'d also have to make the same mistakes.  Mapmakersdeliberately put slight mistakes in their maps so they cantell when someone copies them.  If another map has the samemistake, that\\'s very convincing evidence.Like every other era in history, our moral map almost certainlycontains a few mistakes.  And anyone who makes the same mistakesprobably didn\\'t do it by accident.  It would belike someone claiming they had independently decided in1972 that bell-bottom jeans were a good idea.If you believe everything you\\'re supposed to now, how canyou be sure you wouldn\\'t also have believed everything youwere supposed to if you had grown up among the plantationowners of the pre-Civil War South, or in Germany in the 1930s — oramong the Mongols in 1200, for that matter?  Odds are youwould have.Back in the era of terms like \"well-adjusted,\" the ideaseemed to be that there was something wrong withyou if you thought things you didn\\'t dare say out loud.This seems backward.  Almost certainly, thereis something wrong with you if youdon\\'tthink thingsyou don\\'t dare say out loud.TroubleWhat can\\'t we say?  One way to find these ideas is simply to lookat things people do say, and get in trouble for.  [2]Of course, we\\'re not just looking for things we can\\'t say.   We\\'re looking for things we can\\'t say that are true, or at leasthave enough chance of being true that the questionshould remain open.  But many of thethings people get in trouble for saying probablydo make it over this second, lower threshold.  No onegets in trouble for sayingthat 2 + 2 is 5, or that people in Pittsburgh are ten feet tall.Such obviously false statements might be treated as jokes, orat worst as evidence of insanity, but they are not likely tomake anyone mad.  The statements that make people mad arethe ones they worry might be believed.I suspect the statements that make people maddestare those they worry might be true.If Galileo had said that people in Padua were ten feet tall,he would have been regarded as a harmless eccentric.  Saying   the earth orbited the sun was another matter.  The church knewthis would set people thinking.Certainly, as we look back on the past, this rule of thumb workswell.  A lot of the statements people got in trouble for seemharmless now.  So it\\'s likely that visitors from thefuture would agree with at least some of the statements thatget people in trouble today.  Do we have no Galileos?  Notlikely.To find them,keep track of opinions that getpeople in trouble, and start asking, could this be true?Ok, it may be heretical (or whatever modern equivalent), butmight it also be true?HeresyThis won\\'t get us all the answers, though.  What if no onehappens to have gotten in trouble for a particular idea yet?What if some idea would be so radioactively controversial thatno one would dare express it in public?   How can we find these too?Another approach is to follow that word, heresy.  In every periodof history, there seem to have been labels that got applied to statements to shoot them down before anyone had a chance to askif they were true or not.  \"Blasphemy\", \"sacrilege\", and \"heresy\"were suchlabels for a good part of western history, as in more recent times\"indecent\", \"improper\", and \"unamerican\" have been.   By now theselabels have lost their sting.  They always do.By now they\\'re mostly used ironically.But in their time,they had real force.The word \"defeatist\", for example, has no particular politicalconnotations now.But in Germany in 1917 it was a weapon, used by Ludendorff ina purge of those who favored a negotiated peace.At the start of World War II it was usedextensively by Churchill and his supporters to silence theiropponents.In 1940, any argument against Churchill\\'s aggressive policy was \"defeatist\".Was it right or wrong?  Ideally, no one got far enough to askthat.We have such labels today, of course, quite a lot of them,from the all-purpose \"inappropriate\" to the dreaded \"divisive.\"In any period, it should be easy to figure out what such labels are,simply by looking at what people call ideas they disagreewith besides untrue.  When a politician says his opponent ismistaken, that\\'s a straightforward criticism, but when heattacks a statement as \"divisive\" or \"racially insensitive\"instead of arguing that it\\'s false, we should start payingattention.So another way to figure out which of our taboos future generationswill laugh at is to start with thelabels.  Take a label — \"sexist\", for example — and try to thinkof some ideas that would be called that.  Then for each ask, mightthis be true?Just start listing ideas at random?  Yes, because theywon\\'t really be random.  The ideas that come to mind firstwill be the most plausible ones.  They\\'ll be things you\\'ve already  noticed but didn\\'t let yourself think.In 1989 some clever researchers trackedthe eye movements of radiologists as they scanned chest images forsigns of lung cancer. [3]  They found that even when the radiologistsmissed a cancerous lesion, their eyes had usually paused at the site of it.Part of their brain knew there was something there; it justdidn\\'t percolate all the way up into conscious knowledge. I think many interesting heretical thoughts are already mostly   formed in our minds.  If we turn off our self-censorshiptemporarily, those will be the first to emerge.Time and SpaceIf we could look into the future it would be obvious whichof our taboos they\\'d laugh at.We can\\'t do that, but we can do something almost as good: we canlook into the past.  Another way to figure out what we\\'regetting wrong is to look at what used to be acceptableand is now unthinkable.Changes between the past and the present sometimes do representprogress.  In a field like physics,if we disagree with past generations it\\'s because we\\'reright and they\\'re wrong.  But this becomes rapidly less true as   you move away from the certainty of the hard sciences.  By the timeyou get to social questions, many changes are just fashion.The age of consent fluctuates like hemlines.We may imagine that we are a great deal smarter and more virtuous thanpast generations, but the more history you read, the less likelythis seems.  People in past times were much like us.  Not heroes,not barbarians.  Whatever their ideas were, they were ideasreasonable people could believe.So here is another source of interesting heresies.  Diff presentideas against those of various past cultures, and see what you   get. [4]Some will beshocking by present standards.  Ok, fine; but which might also be true?You don\\'t have to look into the past to find big differences.   In our own time, different societies have wildly varying ideasof what\\'s ok and what isn\\'t.So you can try diffing other cultures\\' ideas against ours as well.(The best way to do that is to visit them.)Any idea that\\'s considered harmless in a significantpercentage of times and places, and yet is taboo in ours,is acandidate for something we\\'re mistakenabout.For example, at the high water mark of political correctnessin the early 1990s, Harvard distributed to itsfaculty and staff a brochure saying, among other things, that itwas inappropriate to compliment a colleague or student\\'sclothes.  No more \"nice shirt.\"I think this principle is rare among the world\\'s cultures, past or present.There are probably more where it\\'s considered especiallypolite to compliment someone\\'s clothing than where it\\'s consideredimproper.Odds are this is, in a mild form, an example of one ofthe taboos a visitor from the future wouldhave to be careful to avoid if he happened to set his time machine forCambridge, Massachusetts, 1992. [5]PrigsOf course, if they have time machines in the future they\\'llprobably have a separate reference manual just for Cambridge.This has always been a fussy place, a town of i dotters andt crossers, where you\\'re liable to get both your grammar and   your ideas corrected in the same conversation.   And thatsuggests another way to find taboos.  Look for prigs,and see what\\'s inside their heads.Kids\\' heads are repositories of all our taboos.It seems fitting to us that kids\\' ideas should be bright and clean.The picture we give them of the world is not merely simplified, to suit their developing minds, but sanitized as well, to suit ourideas of what kids ought to think. [6]You can see this on a small scale in the matter ofdirty words.  A lot of my friends are starting to have childrennow, and they\\'re all trying not to use words like\"fuck\" and \"shit\" within baby\\'s hearing, lest baby start using these words too.But thesewords are part of the language, and adults use them all thetime.  So parents are giving their kids an inaccurate idea of the language by not usingthem.  Why do they do this?  Because they don\\'t think it\\'sfitting that kids should use the whole language.  We likechildren to seem innocent. [7]Most adults, likewise, deliberately give kids a misleadingview of the world.One of the most obviousexamples is Santa Claus.  We think it\\'s cute for little kids tobelieve in Santa Claus.  I myself think it\\'s cute for littlekids to believe in Santa Claus.  But one wonders, do we tellthem this stuff for their sake, or for ours?I\\'m not arguing for or against this idea here.  It is probablyinevitable that parents should want to dress up their kids\\'minds in cute little baby outfits.  I\\'ll probably do it myself.The important thing for our purposes is that, as a result,a well brought-up teenage kid\\'s brain is a moreor less complete collection of all our taboos — and in mintcondition, because they\\'re untainted by experience.  Whatever we think that will later turn out to be ridiculous, it\\'s almost certainly inside that head.How do we get at these ideas?  By the following thought experiment.Imagine a kind of latter-day Conrad characterwho has worked for a time as a mercenary in Africa, for a timeas a doctor in Nepal, for a time as the manager of anightclub in Miami.  The specifics don\\'t matter — justsomeone who hasseen a lot.  Now imagine comparing what\\'s inside this guy\\'s headwith what\\'s inside the headof a well-behaved sixteen year old girl fromthe suburbs.  What does he think thatwould shock her?He knows the world; she knows, or at least embodies, presenttaboos.  Subtract one from the other, and the result is whatwe can\\'t say.MechanismI can think of one more way to figure out what we can\\'tsay: to look at how taboos are created.   How do moralfashions arise, and why are they adopted?If we can understand this mechanism, wemay be able to see it at work in our own time.Moral fashions don\\'t seem to be created the way ordinaryfashions are.  Ordinary fashions seem to arise by accident wheneveryone imitates the whim of some influential person.The fashion for broad-toed shoes inlate fifteenth century Europe began because Charles VIII ofFrance had six toes on one foot.  The fashion for thename Gary began when the actor Frank Cooper adopted the nameof a tough mill town in Indiana.  Moral fashions more oftenseem to be created deliberately.  When there\\'s something wecan\\'t say, it\\'s often because some group doesn\\'t want us to.The prohibition will be strongest when the group is nervous. The irony of Galileo\\'s situation was that he got in troublefor repeating Copernicus\\'s ideas.  Copernicus himself didn\\'t.In fact, Copernicus was a canon of a cathedral, and dedicated hisbook to the pope.  But by Galileo\\'s time the church was inthe throes of the Counter-Reformation and was much moreworried about unorthodox ideas.To launch a taboo, a group has to be poised halfway betweenweakness and power.  A confident group doesn\\'t need taboosto protect it.  It\\'s not considered improper tomake disparaging remarks about Americans, or the English.And yet a group has to be powerful enough to enforce ataboo.  Coprophiles, as of this writing, don\\'t seem to benumerous or energetic enough to have had theirinterests promoted to a lifestyle.I suspect the biggest source of moral taboos will turn out tobe power struggles in which one side only barely hasthe upper hand.  That\\'s where you\\'ll find a grouppowerful enough to enforce taboos, but weak enough to need them.Most struggles, whatever they\\'re really about, will be castas struggles between competing ideas.The English Reformation was at bottom a struggle for wealth and power,but it ended up beingcast as a struggle to preserve the soulsof Englishmen from the corrupting influence of Rome.It\\'s easier to get people to fight for an idea.And whichever side wins, theirideas will also be considered to have triumphed, as if Godwanted to signal his agreement by selecting that side as the victor.We often like to think of World War II as a triumphof freedom over totalitarianism.  We conveniently forget thatthe Soviet Union was also one of the winners.I\\'m not saying that struggles are never about ideas,just that they will always be made to seem to be aboutideas, whether they are or not.   And just as there is nothingso unfashionable as the last, discarded fashion, there isnothing so wrong as the principles of the most recentlydefeated opponent.Representational art is only nowrecovering from the approval of both Hitler and Stalin. [8]Although moral fashions tend to arise from different sourcesthan fashions in clothing, the mechanism of their adoption seemsmuch the same.  The early adopters will be driven by ambition:self-consciously cool people who want to distinguish themselvesfrom the common herd.  As the fashion becomes established they\\'llbe joined by a second, much larger group, driven by fear. [9] Thissecond group adopt the fashion not because they want to standout but because they are afraid of standing out.So if you want to figure out what we can\\'t say, look at themachinery of fashion and try to predict what it would makeunsayable.  What groups are powerful but nervous, and whatideas would they like to suppress?  What ideas were tarnished byassociation when they ended up on the losing side of a recentstruggle?  If a self-consciously cool person wanted to differentiatehimself from preceding fashions (e.g. from his parents), which of their ideas would he tend to reject?What are conventional-minded people afraid of saying?This technique won\\'t find us all the things we can\\'t say.I can think of some that aren\\'t the result ofany recent struggle. Many of our taboos are rooteddeep in the past.  But this approach, combined with thepreceding four, will turn up a good number of unthinkableideas.WhySome would ask, why would one want to do this?  Why deliberatelygo poking around among nasty, disreputable ideas?  Why look under rocks?I do it, first of all, for the same reason I did look underrocks as a kid: plain curiosity.  And I\\'m especially curious aboutanything that\\'s forbidden.  Let me see and decide for myself.Second, I do it because I don\\'t like the idea of being mistaken.If, like other eras, we believe things that will later seem ridiculous,I want to know what they are so that I, at least, can avoidbelieving them.Third, I do it because it\\'s good for the brain.  To do good workyou need a brain that can go anywhere.  And you especially need abrain that\\'s in the habit of going where it\\'s not supposed to.Great work tends to grow out of ideasthat others have overlooked, and no idea is so overlooked as one that\\'sunthinkable.Natural selection, for example.It\\'s so simple.  Why didn\\'t anyone think of it before?  Well,that is all too obvious.  Darwin himself was careful to tiptoearound the implications of his theory.  He wanted to spend histime thinking about biology, not arguing with people who accusedhim of being an atheist.In the sciences, especially, it\\'s a great advantage to be able toquestion assumptions.The m.o. of scientists, or at least of thegood ones, is precisely that: look for places whereconventional wisdom is broken, and then try to pry apart thecracks and see what\\'s underneath.  That\\'s where new theories comefrom.A good scientist, in other words, does not merely ignoreconventional wisdom, but makes a special effort to break it.Scientists go looking for trouble.This should be the m.o. of any scholar, but scientists seem much more willing to look under rocks. [10]Why?  It couldbe that the scientists are simply smarter; most physicists could,if necessary, make it through a PhD program in French literature,but few professors of French literature could make it througha PhD program in physics.  Or it could be because it\\'s clearerin the sciences whether theories are true or false, and thismakes scientists bolder.  (Or it could be that, because it\\'sclearer in the sciences whether theories are true or false, youhave to be smart to get jobs as a scientist, rather than just agood politician.)Whatever the reason, there seems a clear correlation betweenintelligence and willingness to consider shocking ideas.This isn\\'t just because smart people actively work to find holes inconventional thinking.  I think conventions also haveless hold over them to start with.You can see that in theway they dress.It\\'s not only in the sciences that heresy pays off.In any competitive field, you canwin bigby seeing things that others daren\\'t.  And in everyfield there are probably heresies few dare utter.  Withinthe US car industry there is a lot of hand-wringing nowabout declining market share.Yet the cause is so obvious that any observant outsider couldexplain it in a second: they make bad cars.  And they have forso long that by now the US car brands are antibrands — somethingyou\\'d buy a car despite, not because of.  Cadillac stoppedbeing the Cadillac of cars in about 1970.  And yet I suspectno one dares say this. [11]  Otherwise these companies would havetried to fix the problem.Training yourself to think unthinkable thoughts has advantagesbeyond the thoughts themselves.  It\\'s like stretching.When you stretch before running, you put your body into positionsmuch more extremethan any it will assume during the run.If you can think thingsso outside the box that they\\'d make people\\'s hair stand on end,you\\'ll have no trouble with the small trips outside the box thatpeople call innovative.Pensieri StrettiWhen you find something you can\\'t say, what do you do with it?My advice is, don\\'t say it.   Or at least, pick your battles.Suppose in the future there is a movement to banthe color yellow. Proposals to paint anything yellow aredenounced as \"yellowist\", as is anyone suspected of liking the  color.  People who like orange are tolerated but viewed withsuspicion.  Suppose you realize there is nothingwrong with yellow.  If you go around saying this, you\\'ll bedenounced as a yellowist too, and you\\'ll find yourself having a   lot of arguments with anti-yellowists.If your aim in life is to rehabilitate the color yellow, that maybe what you want.But if you\\'re mostly interested inother questions, being labelled as a yellowist will just bea distraction.  Argue with idiots, and you become an idiot.The most important thing is to be able to think what youwant, not to say what you want.  And if you feel you have tosay everything you think, it may inhibit you from thinking  improper thoughts.  I think it\\'s better to follow the oppositepolicy.  Draw a sharp line between your thoughts and yourspeech.  Inside your head, anything is allowed.Within my head I make a point of encouraging the most outrageousthoughts I can imagine. But, as ina secret society, nothing that happens within the buildingshould be told to outsiders.  The first rule of FightClub is, you do not talk about Fight Club.When Milton was going to visit Italy in the 1630s,Sir Henry Wootton, who had been ambassador to Venice, told himhis motto should be\"i pensieri stretti & il viso sciolto.\"Closed thoughtsand an open face.  Smile at everyone, and don\\'t tell themwhat you\\'re thinking.   This was wise advice.Milton was an argumentative fellow, and the Inquisitionwas a bit restive at that time.  But I think the difference between Milton\\'s situation and ours is only a matter ofdegree.Every era has its heresies, and if you don\\'t get imprisoned for them youwill at least get in enough trouble that it becomes a completedistraction.I admit it seems cowardly to keep quiet.When I read about the harassment to whichthe Scientologists subject their critics [12], or that pro-Israel groupsare \"compiling dossiers\" on those who speak out against Israelihuman rights abuses [13], or about people being sued forviolating the DMCA [14], part of me wantsto say, \"All right, you bastards, bring it on.\"The problem is, there are so many things you can\\'t say.If you said them all you\\'d have no time left for your real work.You\\'d have to turn into Noam Chomsky.  [15]The trouble with keeping your thoughts secret, though,is that you lose the advantages of discussion.  Talkingabout an idea leads to more ideas.So the optimal plan, if you can manage it,is to have a few trustedfriends you can speak openly to.  This is not just away to develop ideas; it\\'s also a goodrule of thumb for choosing friends.  The peopleyou can say heretical things to without getting jumped onare also the most interesting to know.Viso Sciolto?I don\\'t think we needtheviso scioltoso much as thepensieri stretti.Perhaps the best policy is to make it plain that you don\\'tagree with whatever zealotry is current in your time, butnot to be too specific about what you disagree with.  Zealotswill try to draw you out, but you don\\'t have to answer them.If they try to force you to treat a question on theirterms by asking \"are you with us or against us?\" you canalways just answer \"neither\".Better still, answer \"I haven\\'t decided.\"That\\'s what Larry Summersdid when a group tried to puthim in this position.  Explaining himself later, he said\"I don\\'t do litmus tests.\" [16]A lot of thequestions people get hot about are actually quite complicated.There is no prize for getting the answer quickly.If the anti-yellowists seem to be getting out of hand andyou want to fight back, there are waysto do it without getting yourself accused of being ayellowist.  Like skirmishers inan ancient army, you want to avoid directly engaging themain body of the enemy\\'s troops.  Better to harass themwith arrows from a distance.One way to do this is to ratchet the debate up one level ofabstraction.If you argue against censorship in general, you can avoid beingaccused of whatever heresy is containedin the book or film that someone is trying to censor.You can attack labels with meta-labels: labels that referto the use of labels to prevent discussion.The spread of the term \"political correctness\" meant the beginning ofthe end of political correctness, because it enabled one toattack the phenomenon as a whole without being accused of anyof the specific heresies it sought to suppress.Another way to counterattack is with metaphor.  Arthur Millerundermined the House Un-American Activities Committeeby writing a play, \"The Crucible,\" about the Salem witch trials.He never referred directly to the committee and so gave themno way to reply.What could HUAC do, defend the Salem witch trials?  And yetMiller\\'s metaphor stuck so well that to this day the activitiesof the committee are often described as a \"witch-hunt.\"Best of all, probably, is humor.  Zealots, whatever their   cause, invariably lack a sense of humor.They can\\'t reply in kind to jokes.They\\'re as unhappy on the territory ofhumor as a mounted knight on a skating rink.Victorian prudishness, for example, seems to have been defeatedmainly by treating it as a joke.  Likewise its reincarnation aspolitical correctness.\"I am glad that Imanaged to write \\'The Crucible,\\'\" Arthur Miller wrote,\"but looking back I have often wished I\\'dhad the temperament to do an absurd comedy, which is what thesituation deserved.\" [17]ABQA Dutch friend saysI should use Holland as an example of a tolerant society.It\\'s true they have a long tradition ofcomparative open-mindedness.  For centuries the low countries were the placeto go to say things you couldn\\'t say anywhere else,and this helped to make the region a center of scholarship and industry(which have been closely tied for longer than most people realize).Descartes, though claimed by the French, did much of his thinking inHolland.And yet, I wonder.  The Dutch seem to live their lives up to theirnecks in rules and regulations.  There\\'s so much you can\\'t do there;is there really nothingyou can\\'t say?Certainly the fact that they value open-mindedness is no guarantee.Who thinks they\\'re not open-minded?  Our hypothetical prim miss fromthe suburbs thinks she\\'s open-minded.  Hasn\\'t she beentaught to be?  Ask anyone, and they\\'ll say the same thing: they\\'repretty open-minded, though they draw the line at things that are reallywrong.  (Some tribesmay avoid \"wrong\" asjudgemental, and may instead use a more neutral sounding euphemismlike \"negative\" or \"destructive\".)When people are bad at math, they know it, because they get thewrong answers on tests.  But when people are bad at open-mindednessthey don\\'t know it.  In fact they tend to think the opposite.Remember, it\\'s the nature of fashion to be invisible.  It wouldn\\'twork otherwise.  Fashion doesn\\'tseem like fashion to someone in the grip of it.  It just seems likethe right thing to do.  It\\'s only by looking from a distance thatwe see oscillations in people\\'s idea of the right thing to do, andcan identify them as fashions.Time gives us such distance for free.  Indeed, the arrival of newfashions makes old fashions easy to see, because theyseem so ridiculous by contrast.  From one end of a pendulum\\'sswing, the other end seems especially far away.To see fashion in your own time, though, requires a conscious effort.Without time to give you distance, you have to create distance yourself.Instead of being part of the mob, standas far away from it as you can and watch what it\\'sdoing.  And pay especially close attention whenever an idea is beingsuppressed.  Web filters for children and employees often bansites containing pornography, violence, and hate speech.  Whatcounts as pornography and violence?  And what, exactly, is\"hate speech?\" This sounds like a phrase out of1984.Labels like that are probably the biggest external clue.If a statement is false,that\\'s the worst thing you can say about it.  You don\\'tneed to say that it\\'s heretical.  And if it isn\\'t false, itshouldn\\'t be suppressed.  So when you see statements beingattacked as x-ist or y-ic (substitute your current values ofx and y), whether in 1630 or 2030, that\\'s a sure sign thatsomething is wrong.  When you hear such labels being used,ask why.Especially if you hear yourself using them.  It\\'s not justthe mob you need to learn to watch from a distance.  You need to beable to watch your own thoughts from a distance.  That\\'s nota radical idea, by the way; it\\'s the main difference betweenchildren and adults.  When a child gets angry because he\\'stired, he doesn\\'t know what\\'s happening.  An adult candistance himself enough from thesituation to say \"never mind, I\\'m just tired.\"  I don\\'tsee why one couldn\\'t, by a similar process, learn torecognize and discount the effects of moral fashions.You have to take that extra step if you want to think clearly.But it\\'s harder, because now you\\'re working against social customs instead of with them.  Everyone encourages you to grow up to the point where you can discount your own bad moods.  Few encourage   you to continue to the point where you can discount society\\'s badmoods.How can you see the wave, when you\\'re the water?  Always bequestioning.  That\\'s the only defence.  What can\\'t you say?  And why?'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': \"It struck me recently how few of the most successful people I knoware mean.  There are exceptions, but remarkably few.Meanness isn't rare.  In fact, one of the things the internet hasshown us is how mean people can be.  A few decades ago, only famouspeople and professional writers got to publish their opinions.  Noweveryone can, and we can all see thelong tail ofmeannessthat had previously been hidden.And yet while there are clearly a lot of mean people out there,there are next to none among the most successful people I know.What's going on here?  Are meanness and success inversely correlated?Part of what's going on, of course, is selection bias.  I only knowpeople who work in certain fields: startup founders, programmers,professors. I'm willing to believe that successful people in otherfields are mean.  Maybe successful hedge fund managers are mean; Idon't know enough to say.  It seems quite likely that most successfuldrug lords are mean.  But there are at least big chunks of the worldthat mean people don't rule, and that territory seems to be growing.My wife and Y Combinator cofounder Jessica is one of those rarepeople who have x-ray vision for character. Being married to heris like standing next to an airport baggage scanner. She came tothe startup world from investment banking, and she has always beenstruck both by how consistently successful startup founders turnout to be good people, and how consistently bad people fail asstartup founders.Why?  I think there are several reasons.  One is that being meanmakes you stupid. That's why I hate fights. You never do your bestwork in a fight, because fights are not sufficiently general.Winning is always a function of the situation and the people involved.You don't win fights by thinking of big ideas but by thinking oftricks that work in one particular case.  And yet fighting is justas much work as thinking about real problems. Which is particularlypainful to someone who cares how their brain is used: your braingoes fast but you get nowhere, like a car spinning its wheels.Startups don't win by attacking. They win by transcending. Thereare exceptions of course, but usually the way to win is to raceahead, not to stop and fight.Another reason mean founders lose is that they can't get the bestpeople to work for them. They can hire people who will put up withthem because they need a job. But the best people have other options.A mean person can't convince the best people to work for him unlesshe is super convincing. And while having the best people helps anyorganization, it's critical for startups.There is also a complementary force at work: if you want to buildgreat things, it helps to be driven by a spirit ofbenevolence. The startup founders who end uprichest are not the ones driven by money.  The ones driven by moneytake the big acquisition offer that nearly every successful startupgets en route.The ones who keep going are driven by somethingelse. They may not say so explicitly, but they're usually tryingto improve the world.  Which means people with a desire to improvethe world have a natural advantage.The exciting thing is that startups are not just one random typeof work in which meanness and success are inversely correlated.This kind of work is the future.For most of history success meant control of scarce resources.  Onegot that by fighting, whether literally in the case of pastoralnomads driving hunter-gatherers into marginal lands, or metaphoricallyin the case of Gilded Age financiers contending with one anotherto assemble railroad monopolies. For most of history, success meantsuccess at zero-sum games. And in most of them meanness was not ahandicap but probably an advantage.That is changing. Increasingly the games that matter are not zero-sum.Increasingly you win not by fighting to get control of a scarceresource, but by having new ideas and building new things.There have long been games where you won by having new ideas. Inthe third century BC, Archimedes won by doing that. At least untilan invading Roman army killed him. Which illustrates whythis change is happening: for new ideas to matter, you need a certaindegree of civil order.  And not just not being at war.  You alsoneed to prevent the sort of economic violence that nineteenth centurymagnates practiced against one another and communist countriespracticed against their citizens.  People need to feel that whatthey create can't be stolen.That has always been the case for thinkers, which is why this trendbegan with them.  When you think of successful people from historywho weren't ruthless, you get mathematicians and writers and artists.The exciting thing is that their m.o. seems to be spreading.  Thegames played by intellectuals are leaking into the real world, andthis is reversing the historical polarity of the relationship betweenmeanness and success.So I'm really glad I stopped to think about this. Jessica and Ihave always worked hard to teach our kids not to be mean.  Wetolerate noise and mess and junk food, but not meanness.  And nowI have both an additional reason to crack down on it, and anadditional argument to use when I do: that being mean makes youfail.\"},\n",

       "  'essay_text': \"(These are some notes I madefor a panel discussion on programming language designat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languagesare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just ashappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason wehave high level languages is because people can't deal withmachine language.  The point of programminglanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being overwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personalthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problemsis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanninga given distance with the least material.  The other end of thespectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend theirtime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routingdata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designingbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designingchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of greatmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of usthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematicalelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.But elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,I don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.In fact I think you ought to design for thebest programmers, buteven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyonewould like programming in a language where all the variables werethe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the bestones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and alot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specificgroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.So you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the mostextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is prettylow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that'swhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is thatthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may beso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionatelylarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language thatthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this isidentical to the question, how do you design a good programminglanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interestingquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitudeof a governess: they try to prevent you fromdoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   opposite approach: give the programmer as muchcontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it wasthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languagesI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   program, written in the language, and the two were very separate.But in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like thosethat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the languageif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.But if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that theyreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondlyof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couplelines of code?  I think anything that really smart people reallylove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anythingyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lotsof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;the syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of thingsshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual shouldbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarificationsand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  yourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixingthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking wasmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I thinkhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture isrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to designbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architectsis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.And I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it'san admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work doesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectualcurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just asworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design ahorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paperabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming anincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They'realso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longerto find the library function that will do what you want than itwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothingbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in point.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organizelibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmercould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an openproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years andstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly naturalto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of Lisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   Whether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question.3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?I think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get writtenin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaningprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Webbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need somenew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based apps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases ayear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as aseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or tenreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latestversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?Well, server-based software likewise has to be designed to bechangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at leastto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server basedsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based softwareyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get theeffect ofsubroutinesin the inherently stateless world of a Websession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,if it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure howreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    do, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that wouldmake as much of a difference as having first class functions orrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossibledream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am alwayslooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing applicationprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktopsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in thesame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,writing software pretty much meant writing software in C.Eventually a tradition evolved:application programs must not be written in unusual languages.  And this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical peoplelike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-basedsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understandsthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).A few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hearabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearingabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windowsapps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programminglanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience forour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at leastlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fastcode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.Knuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few criticalbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guesswhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't needbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can showthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That'swhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net win if language implementors took half the time they wouldhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing agood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languagesall evolved together with some application they were being used towrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.Lisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, andMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiationprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.That will tend to drive your language to have new features that   programmers need.  I personally am interested in writinga language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with theadditional suggestion that the application should not consist ofwriting the compiler for your language, unless your languagehappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly forsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  a lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  Iwould not be surprised ifmostprograms started as throwawayprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good forwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwawayprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think ofsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This willsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.I think that what you want in your language may be relatedto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out thatoperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infixsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you defineis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for anew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new functionto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,there's a big difference in appearance between the use of anoverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970sit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recentlyit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  languages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you canuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language thatactually seems better than others that are available, there will bepeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose timehas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.My guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computingwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  time-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be supportfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richardand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  scheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computerswere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hearabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we havecycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-basedsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers thatthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support permachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computationalbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,because server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun andMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the bytecodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is aconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not becausebyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that thiswhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is thatthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.Designing software that works on the assumption that everyone will have your client is like designing a society on the assumption thateveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, butyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have somekind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them isthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have abrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  pilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be ableto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  And I don't have to know if I bet oneverything just being on the server.  It'sjust so much more robust to have all thebrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is acontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programmingis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kindsof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   like window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don'tsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-orientedprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.Something that might naturally be represented as, say, a list ofintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds ofscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction ofobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of theeffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lispprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you canjust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,instead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn'tbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe theanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people designwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  and not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyoneknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  But I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.When one person is in charge he can take risksthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?Many people might suspectthat language design is something where you should stick fairlyclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.In everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.Why should language design be any different?Japanese Translation\"},\n",

But the problem with that description is not just thatit\\'s unfair.  It\\'s also misleading.  Much of what\\'s most novel aboutYC is due to Jessica Livingston.  If you don\\'t understand her, youdon\\'t understand YC.  So let me tell you a little about Jessica.YC had 4 founders.  Jessica and I decided one night to start it,and the next day we recruited my friends Robert Morris and TrevorBlackwell.  Jessica and I ran YC day to day, and Robert and Trevorread applications and did interviews with us.Jessica and I were already dating when we started YC.  At first wetried to act \"professional\" about this, meaning we tried to concealit.  In retrospect that seems ridiculous, and we soon dropped thepretense.  And the fact that Jessica and I were a couple is a bigpart of what made YC what it was.  YC felt like a family.  Thefounders early on were mostly young.  We all had dinner togetheronce a week, cooked for the first couple years by me. Our firstbuilding had been a private home.  The overall atmosphere wasshockingly different from a VC\\'s office on Sand Hill Road, in a waythat was entirely for the better.  There was an authenticity thateveryone who walked in could sense.  And that didn\\'t just mean thatpeople trusted us.  It was the perfect quality to instill in startups.Authenticity is one of the most important things YC looks for infounders, not just because fakers and opportunists are annoying,but because authenticity is one of the main things that separatesthe most successful startups from the rest.Early YC was a family, and Jessica was its mom.  And the cultureshe defined was one of YC\\'s most important innovations.  Cultureis important in any organization, but at YC culture wasn\\'t just howwe behaved when we built the product. At YC, the culture was theproduct.Jessica was also the mom in another sense: she had the last word.Everything we did as an organization went through herfirst — whoto fund, what to say to the public, how to deal with other companies,who to hire, everything.Before we had kids, YC was more or less our life. There was no realdistinction between working hours and not.  We talked about YC allthe time.  And while there might be some businesses that it wouldbe tedious to let infect your private life, we liked it. We\\'d startedYC because it was something we were interested in.  And some of theproblems we were trying to solve were endlessly difficult.  How doyou recognize good founders?  You could talk about that for years,and we did; we still do.I\\'m better at some things than Jessica, and she\\'s better at somethings than me.  One of the things she\\'s best at is judging people.She\\'s one of those rare individuals with x-ray vision for character.She can see through any kind of faker almost immediately.  Hernickname within YC was the Social Radar, and this special power ofhers was critical in making YC what it is.  The earlier you pickstartups, the more you\\'re picking the founders.  Later stage investorsget to try products and look at growth numbers.  At the stage whereYC invests, there is often neither a product nor any numbers.Others thought YC had some special insight about the future oftechnology.  Mostly we had the same sort of insight Socrates claimed:we at least knew we knew nothing.  What made YC successful was beingable to pick good founders.  We thought Airbnb was a bad idea.  Wefunded it because we liked the founders.During interviews, Robert and Trevor and I would pepper the applicantswith technical questions.  Jessica would mostly watch.  A lot ofthe applicants probably read her as some kind of secretary, especiallyearly on, because she was the one who\\'d go out and get each newgroup and she didn\\'t ask many questions. She was ok with that.  Itwas easier for her to watch people if they didn\\'t notice her. Butafter the interview, the three of us would turn to Jessica and ask\"What does the Social Radar say?\"Having the Social Radar at interviews wasn\\'t just how we pickedfounders who\\'d be successful.  It was also how we picked founderswho were good people.  At first we did this because we couldn\\'thelp it.  Imagine what it would feel like to have x-ray vision forcharacter.  Being around bad people would be intolerable.  So we\\'drefuse to fund founders whose characters we had doubts about evenif we thought they\\'d be successful.Though we initially did this out of self-indulgence, it turned outto be very valuable to YC.  We didn\\'t realize it in the beginning,but the people we were picking would become the YC alumni network.And once we picked them, unless they did something really egregious,they were going to be part of it for life. Some now think YC\\'salumni network is its most valuable feature. I personally thinkYC\\'s advice is pretty good too, but the alumni network is certainlyamong the most valuable features.  The level of trust and helpfulnessis remarkable for a group of such size.  And Jessica is the mainreason why.(As we later learned, it probably cost us little to reject peoplewhose characters we had doubts about, because how good founders areand how well they do arenot orthogonal.  If bad founders succeedat all, they tend to sell early.  The most successful founders arealmost all good.)If Jessica was so important to YC, why don\\'t more people realizeit?  Partly because I\\'m a writer, and writers always get disproportionateattention.  YC\\'s brand was initially my brand, and our applicantswere people who\\'d read my essays.  But there is another reason:Jessica hates attention.  Talking to reporters makes her nervous.The thought of giving a talk paralyzes her.  She was even uncomfortableat our wedding, because the bride is always the center of attention.It\\'s not just because she\\'s shy that she hates attention, but becauseit throws off the Social Radar. She can\\'t be herself. You can\\'twatch people when everyone is watching you.Another reason attention worries her is that she hates bragging.In anything she does that\\'s publicly visible, her biggest fear(after the obvious fear that it will be bad) is that it will seemostentatious.  She says being too modest is a common problem forwomen.  But in her case it goes beyond that.  She has a horror ofostentation so visceral it\\'s almost a phobia.She also hates fighting. She can\\'t do it; she just shuts down.  Andunfortunately there is a good deal of fighting in being the publicface of an organization.So although Jessica more than anyone made YC unique, the veryqualities that enabled her to do it mean she tends to get writtenout of YC\\'s history.  Everyone buys this story that PG started YCand his wife just kind of helped.  Even YC\\'s haters buy it.  Acouple years ago when people were attacking us for not funding morefemale founders (than exist), they all treated YC as identical withPG.  It would have spoiled the narrative to acknowledge Jessica\\'scentral role at YC.Jessica was boiling mad that people were accusinghercompany ofsexism. I\\'ve never seen her angrier about anything.  But she didnot contradict them.  Not publicly.  In private there was a greatdeal of profanity.  And she wrote three separate essays about thequestion of female founders.  But she could never bring herself topublish any of them.  She\\'d seen the level of vitriol in this debate,and she shrank from engaging.It wasn\\'t just because she disliked fighting.  She\\'s so sensitiveto character that it repels her even to fight with dishonest people.The idea of mixing it up with linkbait journalists or Twitter trollswould seem to her not merely frightening, but disgusting.But Jessica knew her example as a successful female founder wouldencourage more women to start companies, so last year she didsomething YC had never done before and hired a PR firm to get hersome interviews.  At one of the first she did, the reporter brushedaside her insights about startups and turned it into a sensationalisticstory about how some guy had tried to chat her up as she was waitingoutside the bar where they had arranged to meet.  Jessica wasmortified, partly because the guy had done nothing wrong, but morebecause the story treated her as a victim significant only for beinga woman, rather than one of the most knowledgeable investors in theValley.After that she told the PR firm to stop.You\\'re not going to be hearing in the press about what Jessica hasachieved. So let me tell you what Jessica has achieved.Y Combinatoris fundamentally a nexus of people, like a university. It doesn\\'tmake a product. What defines it is the people.  Jessica more thananyone curated and nurtured that collection of people.  In thatsense she literally made YC.Jessica knows more about the qualities of startup founders thananyone else ever has. Her immense data set and x-ray vision are theperfect storm in that respect.  The qualities of the founders arethe best predictor of how a startup will do.  And startups are inturn the most important source of growth in mature economies.The person who knows the most about the most important factor inthe growth of mature economies — that is who Jessica Livingston is.Doesn\\'t that sound like someone who should be better known?'},\n",

Well, we humans areas conspicuously different from other animals as the anteater.In our case the distinguishing feature is the ability to reason.So obviously that is what we should be doing, and a human whodoesn\\'t is doing a bad job of being human — is no better than ananimal.Now we\\'d give a different answer.  At least, someone Socrates\\'s agewould.  We\\'d ask why we even suppose we have a \"purpose\" in life.We may be better adapted for some things than others; wemay be happier doing things we\\'re adapted for; but why assumepurpose?The history of ideasis a history of gradually discarding the assumption that it\\'s allabout us.  No, it turns out, the earth is not the center of theuniverse — not even the center of the solar system.  No, it turnsout, humans are not created by God in his own image; they\\'re justone species among many, descended not merely from apes, but frommicroorganisms.  Even the concept of \"me\" turns out to be fuzzyaround the edges if you examine it closely.The idea that we\\'re the center of things is difficult to discard.So difficult that there\\'s probably room to discard more.  RichardDawkins made another step in that direction only in the last severaldecades, with the idea of theselfish gene.   No, it turnsout, we\\'re not even the protagonists: we\\'re just the latest modelvehicle our genes have constructed to travel around in.  And havingkids is our genes heading for the lifeboats.

       "  'essay_text': '(This essay is derived from a keynote at Xtech.)Could you reproduce Silicon Valley elsewhere, or is there somethingunique about it?It wouldn\\'t be surprising if it were hard to reproduce in othercountries, because you couldn\\'t reproduce it in most of the USeither.  What does it take to make a silicon valley even here?What it takes is the right people.  If you could get the right tenthousand people to move from Silicon Valley to Buffalo, Buffalowould become Silicon Valley.That\\'s a striking departure from the past.  Up till a couple decadesago, geography was destiny for cities.  All great cities were locatedon waterways, because cities made money by trade, and water was theonly economical way to ship.Now you could make a great city anywhere, if you could get the rightpeople to move there.  So the question of how to make a siliconvalley becomes: who are the right people, and how do you get themto move?Two TypesI think you only need two kinds of people to create a technologyhub: rich people and nerds.  They\\'re the limiting reagents in thereaction that produces startups, because they\\'re the only onespresent when startups get started.  Everyone else will move.Observation bears this out: within the US, towns have become startuphubs if and only if they have both rich people and nerds.  Fewstartups happen in Miami, for example, because although it\\'s fullof rich people, it has few nerds.  It\\'s not the kind of place nerdslike.Whereas Pittsburgh has the opposite problem: plenty of nerds, butno rich people.  The top US Computer Science departments are saidto be MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, and Carnegie-Mellon.  MIT yieldedRoute 128.  Stanford and Berkeley yielded Silicon Valley.  ButCarnegie-Mellon?  The record skips at that point.  Lower down thelist, the University of Washington yielded a high-tech communityin Seattle, and the University of Texas at Austin yielded one inAustin.  But what happened in Pittsburgh?  And in Ithaca, home ofCornell, which is also high on the list?I grew up in Pittsburgh and went to college at Cornell, so I cananswer for both.  The weather is terrible,  particularly in winter,and there\\'s no interesting old city to make up for it, as there isin Boston.  Rich people don\\'t want to live in Pittsburgh or Ithaca.So while there are plenty of hackers who could start startups,there\\'s no one to invest in them.Not BureaucratsDo you really need the rich people?  Wouldn\\'t it work to have thegovernment invest in the nerds?  No, it would not.  Startup investorsare a distinct type of rich people.  They tend to have a lot ofexperience themselves in the technology business.  This (a) helpsthem pick the right startups, and (b) means they can supply adviceand connections as well as money.  And the fact that they have apersonal stake in the outcome makes them really pay attention.Bureaucrats by their nature are the exact opposite sort of peoplefrom startup investors. The idea of them making startup investmentsis comic.  It would be like mathematicians runningVogue-- orperhaps more accurately,Vogueeditors running a math journal.Though indeed, most things bureaucrats do, they do badly.   We justdon\\'t notice usually, because they only have to compete againstother bureaucrats.  But as startup investors they\\'d have to competeagainst pros with a great deal more experience and motivation.Even corporations that have in-house VC groups generally forbidthem to make their own investment decisions.  Most are only allowedto invest in deals where some reputable private VC firm is willingto act as lead investor.Not BuildingsIf you go to see Silicon Valley, what you\\'ll see are buildings.But it\\'s the people that make it Silicon Valley, not the buildings.I read occasionally about attempts to set up \"technologyparks\" in other places, as if the active ingredient of SiliconValley were the office space.  An article about Sophia Antipolisbragged that companies there included Cisco, Compaq, IBM, NCR, andNortel.  Don\\'t the French realize these aren\\'t startups?Building office buildings for technology companies won\\'t get you asilicon valley, because the key stage in the life of a startuphappens before they want that kind of space.  The key stage is whenthey\\'re three guys operating out of an apartment.  Wherever thestartup is when it gets funded, it will stay.  The defining qualityof Silicon Valley is not that Intel or Apple or Google have officesthere, but that they werestartedthere.So if you want to reproduce Silicon Valley, what you need to reproduceis those two or three founders sitting around a kitchen tabledeciding to start a company.  And to reproduce that you need thosepeople.UniversitiesThe exciting thing is,allyou need are the people.  If you couldattract a critical mass of nerds and investors to live somewhere,you could reproduce Silicon Valley.  And both groups are highlymobile.  They\\'ll go where life is good.  So what makes a place goodto them?What nerds like is other nerds.  Smart people will go wherever othersmart people are.  And in particular, to great universities.  Intheory there could be other ways to attract them, but so faruniversities seem to be indispensable.  Within the US, there areno technology hubs without first-rate universities-- or at least,first-rate computer science departments.So if you want to make a silicon valley, you not only need auniversity, but one of the top handful in the world.  It has to begood enough to act as a magnet, drawing the best people from thousandsof miles away.  And that means it has to stand up to existing magnetslike MIT and Stanford.This sounds hard.  Actually it might be easy.  My professor friends,when they\\'re deciding where they\\'d like to work, consider one thingabove all: the quality of the other faculty.  What attracts professorsis good colleagues.  So if you managed to recruit, en masse, asignificant number of the best young researchers, you could createa first-rate university from nothing overnight.  And you could dothat for surprisingly little.  If you paid 200 people hiring bonusesof $3 million apiece, you could put together a faculty that wouldbear comparison with any in the world.  And from that point thechain reaction would be self-sustaining.  So whatever it costs toestablish a mediocre university, for an additional half billion orso you could have a great one.PersonalityHowever, merely creating a new university would not be enough tostart a silicon valley. The university is just the seed.  It hasto be planted in the right soil, or it won\\'t germinate.  Plant itin the wrong place, and you just create Carnegie-Mellon.To spawn startups, your university has to be in a town that hasattractions other than the university.  It has to be a place whereinvestors want to live, and students want to stay after they graduate.The two like much the same things, because most startup investorsare nerds themselves.  So what do nerds look for in a town?  Theirtastes aren\\'t completely different from other people\\'s, because alot of the towns they like most in the US are also big touristdestinations: San Francisco, Boston, Seattle.   But their tastescan\\'t be quite mainstream either, because they dislike other bigtourist destinations, like New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.There has been a lot written lately about the \"creative class.\" Thethesis seems to be that as wealth derives increasingly from ideas,cities will prosper only if they attract those who have them.  Thatis certainly true; in fact it was the basis of Amsterdam\\'s prosperity400 years ago.A lot of nerd tastes they share with the creative class in general.For example, they like well-preserved old neighborhoods instead ofcookie-cutter suburbs, and locally-owned shops and restaurantsinstead of national chains.  Like the rest of the creative class,they want to live somewhere with personality.What exactly is personality?  I think it\\'s the feeling that eachbuilding is the work of a distinct group of people.  A town withpersonality is one that doesn\\'t feel mass-produced.  So if you wantto make a startup hub-- or any town to attract the \"creative class\"--you probably have to ban large development projects.When a large tract has been developed by a single organization, youcan always tell.Most towns with personality are old, but they don\\'t have to be.Old towns have two advantages: they\\'re denser, because they werelaid out before cars, and they\\'re more varied, because they werebuilt one building at a time.  You could have both now.  Just havebuilding codes that ensure density, and ban large scale developments.A corollary is that you have to keep out the biggest developer ofall: the government.  A government that asks \"How can we build asilicon valley?\" has probably ensured failure by the way they framedthe question.  You don\\'t build a silicon valley; you let one grow.NerdsIf you want to attract nerds, you need more than a town withpersonality.  You need a town with the right personality.  Nerdsare a distinct subset of the creative class, with different tastesfrom the rest.  You can see this most clearly in New York, whichattracts a lot of creative people, but few nerds.What nerds like is the kind of town where people walk around smiling.This excludes LA, where no one walks at all, and also New York,where people walk, but not smiling. When I was in grad school inBoston, a friend came to visit from New York.  On the subway backfrom the airport she asked \"Why is everyone smiling?\"  I looked andthey weren\\'t smiling.  They just looked like they were compared tothe facial expressions she was used to.If you\\'ve lived in New York, you know where these facial expressionscome from.  It\\'s the kind of place where your mind may be excited,but your body knows it\\'s having a bad time.  People don\\'t so muchenjoy living there as endure it for the sake of the excitement.And if you like certain kinds of excitement, New York is incomparable.It\\'s a hub of glamour, a magnet for all the shorter half-lifeisotopes of style and fame.Nerds don\\'t care about glamour, so to them the appeal of New Yorkis a mystery.  People who like New York will pay a fortune for asmall, dark, noisy apartment in order to live in a town where thecool people are really cool.  A nerd looks at that deal and seesonly: pay a fortune for a small, dark, noisy apartment.Nerdswillpay a premium to live in a town where the smart peopleare really smart, but you don\\'t have to pay as much for that.  It\\'ssupply and demand: glamour is popular, so you have to pay a lot forit.Most nerds like quieter pleasures.  They like cafes instead ofclubs; used bookshops instead of fashionable clothing shops; hikinginstead of dancing; sunlight instead of tall buildings.  A nerd\\'sidea of paradise is Berkeley or Boulder.YouthIt\\'s the young nerds who start startups, so it\\'s those specificallythe city has to appeal to.  The startup hubs in the US are allyoung-feeling towns.  This doesn\\'t mean they have to be new.Cambridge has the oldest town plan in America, but it feels youngbecause it\\'s full of students.What you can\\'t have, if you want to create a silicon valley, is alarge, existing population of stodgy people.  It would be a wasteof time to try to reverse the fortunes of a declining industrial townlike Detroit or Philadelphia by trying to encourage startups.  Thoseplaces have too much momentum in the wrong direction.  You\\'re betteroff starting with a blank slate in the form of a small town.  Orbetter still, if there\\'s a town young people already flock to, thatone.The Bay Area was a magnet for the young and optimistic for decadesbefore it was associated with technology.  It was a place peoplewent in search of something new.  And so it became synonymous withCalifornia nuttiness.  There\\'s still a lot of that there.  If youwanted to start a new fad-- a new way to focus one\\'s \"energy,\" forexample, or a new category of things not to eat-- the Bay Area wouldbe the place to do it.  But a place that tolerates oddness in thesearch for the new is exactly what you want in a startup hub, becauseeconomically that\\'s what startups are.  Most good startup ideasseem a little crazy; if they were obviously good ideas, someonewould have done them already.(How many people are going to want computers in theirhouses?What,anothersearch engine?)That\\'s the connection between technology and liberalism.  Withoutexception the high-tech cities in the US are also the most liberal.But it\\'s not because liberals are smarter that this is so.  It\\'sbecause liberal cities tolerate odd ideas, and smart people bydefinition have odd ideas.Conversely, a town that gets praised for being \"solid\" or representing\"traditional values\" may be a fine place to live, but it\\'s nevergoing to succeed as a startup hub.  The 2004 presidential election,though a disaster in other respects, conveniently supplied us witha county-by-countymapof such places.To attract the young, a town must have an intact center.  In mostAmerican cities the center has been abandoned, and the growth, ifany, is in the suburbs.  Most American cities have been turnedinside out. But none of the startup hubs has: not San Francisco,or Boston, or Seattle.  They all have intact centers.My guess is that no city with a dead center could be turned into astartup hub.  Young people don\\'t want to live in the suburbs.Within the US, the two cities I think could most easily be turnedinto new silicon valleys are Boulder and Portland.  Both have thekind of effervescent feel that attracts the young.  They\\'re eachonly a great university short of becoming a silicon valley, if theywanted to.TimeA great university near an attractive town.  Is that all it takes?That was all it took to make the original Silicon Valley.  SiliconValley traces its origins to William Shockley, one of the inventorsof the transistor.  He did the research that won him the Nobel Prizeat Bell Labs, but when he started his own company in 1956 he movedto Palo Alto to do it.   At the time that was an odd thing to do.Why did he?  Because he had grown up there and remembered how niceit was.  Now Palo Alto is suburbia, but then it was a charmingcollege town-- a charming college town with perfect weather and SanFrancisco only an hour away.The companies that rule Silicon Valley now are all descended invarious ways from Shockley Semiconductor.  Shockley was a difficultman, and in 1957 his top people-- \"the traitorous eight\"-- left tostart a new company, Fairchild Semiconductor.  Among them wereGordon Moore and Robert Noyce, who went on to found Intel, andEugene Kleiner, who founded the VC firm Kleiner Perkins.  Forty-twoyears later, Kleiner Perkins funded Google, and the partner responsiblefor the deal was John Doerr, who came to Silicon Valley in 1974 towork for Intel.So although a lot of the newest companies in Silicon Valley don\\'tmake anything out of silicon, there always seem to be multiple linksback to Shockley.  There\\'s a lesson here: startups beget startups.People who work for startups start their own.  People who get richfrom startups fund new ones.  I suspect this kind of organic growthis the only way to produce a startup hub, because it\\'s the only wayto grow the expertise you need.That has two important implications.  The first is that you needtime to grow a silicon valley.  The university you could create ina couple years, but the startup community around it has to groworganically.   The cycle time is limited by the time it takes acompany to succeed, which probably averages about five years.The other implication of the organic growth hypothesis is that youcan\\'t be somewhat of a startup hub.  You either have a self-sustainingchain reaction, or not.  Observation confirms this too: citieseither have a startup scene, or they don\\'t.  There is no middleground.  Chicago has the third largest metropolitan area in America.As source of startups it\\'s negligible compared to Seattle, number 15.The good news is that the initial seed can be quite small.  ShockleySemiconductor, though itself not very successful, was big enough.It brought a critical mass of experts in an important new technologytogether in a place they liked enough to stay.CompetingOf course, a would-be silicon valley faces an obstacle the originalone didn\\'t: it has to compete with Silicon Valley.  Can that bedone?  Probably.One of Silicon Valley\\'s biggest advantages is its venture capitalfirms.  This was not a factor in Shockley\\'s day, because VC fundsdidn\\'t exist.  In fact, Shockley Semiconductor and FairchildSemiconductor were not startups at all in our sense.  They weresubsidiaries-- of Beckman Instruments and Fairchild Camera andInstrument respectively.  Those companies were apparently willingto establish subsidiaries wherever the experts wanted to live.Venture investors, however, prefer to fund startups within an hour\\'sdrive.  For one, they\\'re more likely to notice startups nearby.But when they do notice startups in other towns they prefer themto move.  They don\\'t want to have to travel to attend board meetings,and in any case the odds of succeeding are higher in a startup hub.The centralizing effect of venture firms is a double one: they causestartups to form around them, and those draw in more startups throughacquisitions.  And although the first may be weakening because it\\'snow so cheap to start some startups, the second seems as strong as ever.Three of the most admired\"Web 2.0\" companies were started outside the usual startup hubs,but two of them have already been reeled in through acquisitions.Such centralizing forces make it harder for new silicon valleys toget started.  But by no means impossible.  Ultimately power restswith the founders.  A startup with the best people will beat onewith funding from famous VCs, and a startup that was sufficientlysuccessful would never have to move.  So a town thatcould exert enough pull over the right people could resist andperhaps even surpass Silicon Valley.For all its power, Silicon Valley has a great weakness: the paradiseShockley found in 1956 is now one giant parking lot.  San Franciscoand Berkeley are great, but they\\'re forty miles away.  SiliconValley proper is soul-crushing suburbansprawl.  Ithas fabulous weather, which makes it significantly better than thesoul-crushing sprawl of most other American cities.  But a competitorthat managed to avoid sprawl would have real leverage.  All a cityneeds is to be the kind of place the next traitorous eight look atand say \"I want to stay here,\" and that would be enough to get thechain reaction started.'},\n",

Or rather, I don\\'t think they realize how much it mattersthat it\\'s broken.The way Apple runs the App Store has harmed their reputation withprogrammers more than anything else they\\'ve ever done. Their reputation with programmers used to be great.It used to be the most common complaint you heardabout Apple was that their fans admired them too uncritically.The App Store has changed that.  Now a lot of programmershave started to see Apple as evil.How much of the goodwill Apple once had with programmers have theylost over the App Store?  A third?  Half?  And that\\'s just so far.The App Store is an ongoing karma leak.* * *How did Apple get into this mess?  Their fundamental problem isthat they don\\'t understand software.They treat iPhone apps the way they treat the music they sell throughiTunes.  Apple is the channel; they own the user; if you want toreach users, you do it on their terms. The record labels agreed,reluctantly.  But this model doesn\\'t work for software.  It doesn\\'twork for an intermediary to own the user.  The software businesslearned that in the early 1980s, when companies like VisiCorp showedthat although the words \"software\" and \"publisher\" fit together,the underlying concepts don\\'t.  Software isn\\'t like music or books.It\\'s too complicated for a third party to act as an intermediarybetween developer and user.   And yet that\\'s what Apple is tryingto be with the App Store: a software publisher.  And a particularlyoverreaching one at that, with fussy tastes and a rigidly enforcedhouse style.If software publishing didn\\'t work in 1980, it works even less nowthat software development has evolved from a small number of bigreleases to a constant stream of small ones.  But Apple doesn\\'tunderstand that either.  Their model of product development derivesfrom hardware.  They work on something till they think it\\'s finished,then they release it.  You have to do that with hardware, but becausesoftware is so easy to change, its design can benefit from evolution.The standard way to develop applications now is to launch fast anditerate.  Which means it\\'s a disaster to have long, random delayseach time you release a new version.Apparently Apple\\'s attitude is that developers should be more carefulwhen they submit a new version to the App Store.  They would saythat.  But powerful as they are, they\\'re not powerful enough toturn back the evolution of technology.  Programmers don\\'t uselaunch-fast-and-iterate out of laziness.  They use it because ityields the best results.  By obstructing that process, Apple ismaking them do bad work, and programmers hate that as much as Applewould.How would Apple like it if when they discovered a serious bug inOS\\xa0X, instead of releasing a software update immediately, they hadto submit their code to an intermediary who sat on it for a monthand then rejected it because it contained an icon they didn\\'t like?By breaking software development, Apple gets the opposite of whatthey intended: the version of an app currently available in the AppStore tends to be an old and buggy one.  One developer told me:As a result of their process, the App Store is full of half-baked  applications. I make a new version almost every day that I release  to beta users. The version on the App Store feels old and crappy.  I\\'m sure that a lot of developers feel this way: One emotion is  \"I\\'m not really proud about what\\'s in the App Store\", and it\\'s  combined with the emotion \"Really, it\\'s Apple\\'s fault.\"Another wrote:I believe that they think their approval process helps users by  ensuring quality.  In reality, bugs like ours get through all the  time and then it can take 4-8 weeks to get that bug fix approved,  leaving users to think that iPhone apps sometimes just don\\'t work.  Worse for Apple, these apps work just fine on other platforms  that have immediate approval processes.Actually I suppose Apple has a third misconception: that all thecomplaints about App Store approvals are not a serious problem.They must hear developers complaining.  But partners and suppliersare always complaining.  It would be a bad sign if they weren\\'t;it would mean you were being too easy on them.  Meanwhile the iPhoneis selling better than ever.  So why do they need to fix anything?They get away with maltreating developers, in the short term, becausethey make such great hardware.  I just bought a new 27\" iMac acouple days ago.  It\\'s fabulous.  The screen\\'s too shiny, and thedisk is surprisingly loud, but it\\'s so beautiful that you can\\'tmake yourself care.So I bought it, but I bought it, for the first time, with misgivings.I felt the way I\\'d feel buying something made in a country with abad human rights record.  That was new.  In the past when I boughtthings from Apple it was an unalloyed pleasure.  Oh boy!  They makesuch great stuff.  This time it felt like a Faustian bargain.  Theymake such great stuff, but they\\'re such assholes.  Do I really wantto support this company?* * *Should Apple care what people like me think?  What difference doesit make if they alienate a small minority of their users?There are a couple reasons they should care.  One is that theseusers are the people they want as employees.  If your company seemsevil, the best programmers won\\'t work for you.  That hurt Microsofta lot starting in the 90s.  Programmers started to feel sheepishabout working there.  It seemed like selling out.  When people fromMicrosoft were talking to other programmers and they mentioned wherethey worked, there were a lot of self-deprecating jokes about havinggone over to the dark side.  But the real problem for Microsoftwasn\\'t the embarrassment of the people they hired.  It was thepeople they never got.  And you know who got them?  Google andApple.  If Microsoft was the Empire, they were the Rebel Alliance.And it\\'s largely because they got more of the best people thatGoogle and Apple are doing so much better than Microsoft today.Why are programmers so fussy about their employers\\' morals?  Partlybecause they can afford to be.  The best programmers can workwherever they want.  They don\\'t have to work for a company theyhave qualms about.But the other reason programmers are fussy, I think, is that evilbegets stupidity.  An organization that wins by exercising powerstarts to lose the ability to win by doing better work.  And it\\'snot fun for a smart person to work in a place where the best ideasaren\\'t the ones that win.  I think the reason Google embraced \"Don\\'tbe evil\" so eagerly was not so much to impress the outside worldas to inoculate themselves against arrogance.That has worked for Google so far.  They\\'ve become morebureaucratic, but otherwise they seem to have held true to theiroriginal principles. With Apple that seems less the case.  When youlook at the famous1984 adnow, it\\'s easier to imagine Apple as thedictator on the screen than the woman with the hammer.In fact, if you read the dictator\\'s speech it sounds uncannily like aprophecy of the App Store.We have triumphed over the unprincipled dissemination of facts.We have created, for the first time in all history, a garden of  pure ideology, where each worker may bloom secure from the pests  of contradictory and confusing truths.The other reason Apple should care what programmers think of themis that when you sell a platform, developers make or break you.  Ifanyone should know this, Apple should.  VisiCalc made the Apple II.And programmers build applications for the platforms they use.  Mostapplications—most startups, probably—grow out of personal projects.Apple itself did.  Apple made microcomputers because that\\'s whatSteve Wozniak wanted for himself.  He couldn\\'t have afforded aminicomputer.Microsoft likewise started out making interpretersfor little microcomputers becauseBill Gates and Paul Allen were interested in using them.  It\\'s arare startup that doesn\\'t build something the founders use.The main reason there are so many iPhone apps is that so many programmershave iPhones.  They may know, because they read it in an article,that Blackberry has such and such market share.  But in practiceit\\'s as if RIM didn\\'t exist. If they\\'re going to build something,they want to be able to use it themselves, and that means buildingan iPhone app.So programmers continue to develop iPhone apps, even though Applecontinues to maltreat them.  They\\'re like someone stuck in an abusiverelationship.  They\\'re so attracted to the iPhone that they can\\'tleave.  But they\\'re looking for a way out.  One wrote:While I did enjoy developing for the iPhone, the control they  place on the App Store does not give me the drive to develop  applications as I would like. In fact I don\\'t intend to make any  more iPhone applications unless absolutely necessary.Can anything break this cycle?  No device I\\'ve seen so far could.Palm and RIM haven\\'t a hope.  The only credible contender is Android.But Android is an orphan; Google doesn\\'t really care about it, notthe way Apple cares about the iPhone.  Apple cares about the iPhonethe way Google cares about search.* * *Is the future of handheld devices one locked down by Apple?  It\\'sa worrying prospect.  It would be a bummer to have another grimmonoculture like we had in the 1990s.  In 1995, writing softwarefor end users was effectively identical with writing Windowsapplications.  Our horror at that prospect was the single biggestthing that drove us to start buildingweb apps.At least we know now what it would take to break Apple\\'s lock.You\\'d have to get iPhones out of programmers\\' hands.  If programmersused some other device for mobile web access, they\\'d start to developapps for that instead.How could you make a device programmers liked better than the iPhone?It\\'s unlikely you could make something better designed.  Appleleaves no room there.  So this alternative device probably couldn\\'twin on general appeal.  It would have to win by virtue of someappeal it had to programmers specifically.One way to appeal to programmers is with software.  If youcould think of an application programmers had to have, but thatwould be impossible in the circumscribed world of the iPhone, you could presumably get them to switch.That would definitely happen if programmers started to use handheldsas development machines—if handhelds displaced laptops theway laptops displaced desktops.  You need more control of a developmentmachine than Apple will let you have over an iPhone.Could anyone make a device that you\\'d carry around in your pocketlike a phone, and yet would also work as a development machine?It\\'s hard to imagine what it would look like.  But I\\'ve learnednever to say never about technology.  A phone-sized device thatwould work as a development machine is no more miraculous by presentstandards than the iPhone itself would have seemed by the standardsof 1995.My current development machine is a MacBook Air, which I use withan external monitor and keyboard in my office, and by itself whentraveling.  If there was a version half the size I\\'d prefer it.That still wouldn\\'t be small enough to carry around everywhere likea phone, but we\\'re within a factor of 4 or so.  Surely that gap isbridgeable.  In fact, let\\'s make it anRFS. Wanted: Woman with hammer.'},\n",

The single biggest thing the government could do to increase the number of startups in this country is a policy that would cost nothing: establish a new class of visa forstartup founders.The biggest constraint on the number of new startups that get created in the US is not tax policy or employment law or even Sarbanes-Oxley.  It's that we won't let the people who want to start them into the country.Letting just 10,000 startup founders into the country each year could have a visible effect on the economy.  If we assume 4 people per startup, which is probably an overestimate, that's 2500 new companies.Each year.They wouldn't all grow as big as Google, but out of 2500 some would come close.By definition these 10,000 founders wouldn't be taking jobs from Americans: it could be part of the terms of the visa that they couldn't work for existing companies, only new ones they'd founded.  In fact they'd cause there to be more jobs for Americans, because the companies they started would hire more employees as they grew.The tricky part might seem to be how one defined a startup. But that could be solved quite easily: let the market decide.  Startup investors work hard to find the best startups.  The government could not do better than to piggyback on their expertise, and use investment by recognized startup investors as the test of whether a company was a real startup.How would the government decide who's a startup investor?  The same way they decide what counts as a university for student visas. We'll establish our own accreditation procedure. We know who one another are.10,000 people is a drop in the bucket by immigration standards, but would represent a huge increase in the pool of startup founders.  I think this would have such a visible effect on the economy that it would make the legislator who introduced the bill famous.

Imeant that Python programmers are smart. It's a lot ofwork to learn a new programming language.  And people don'tlearn Python because it will get them a job; they learn itbecause they genuinely like to program and aren't satisfied with the languages theyalready know.Which makes them exactly the kind of programmerscompanies should want to hire.  Hence what, for lack of a bettername, I'll call the Python paradox: if a company chooses to writeits software in a comparatively esoteric language, they'll be able to hire better programmers, because they'll attract only thosewho cared enough to learn it.  And for programmers the paradox is even more pronounced: the languageto learn, if you want to get a good job, is a language thatpeople don't learn merely to get a job.Only a few companies have been smart enough to realize this so far.  But there is a kind of selection going on here too: they're exactly the companies programmers wouldmost like to work for.  Google, for example.  When they     advertise Java programming jobs, they also want Python experience.A friend of mine who knows nearly all the widely used languagesuses Python for most of his projects.  He says the main reasonis that he likes the way source code looks.  That may seema frivolous reason to choose one language over another.But it is not so frivolous as it sounds: when you program,you spend more time reading code than writing it.You push blobs of source code around the way a sculptor doesblobs of clay.  So a language that makes source code ugly ismaddening to an exacting programmer, as clay full of lumpswould be to a sculptor.At the mention of ugly source code, people will of course thinkof Perl.  But the superficial ugliness of Perl is not the sortI mean.  Real ugliness is not harsh-lookingsyntax, but having to build programs out of the wrongconcepts.

       "  'essay_text': 'If you asked people what was special about Einstein, most would saythat he was really smart. Even the ones who tried to give you amore sophisticated-sounding answer would probably think this first.Till a few years ago I would have given the same answer myself. Butthat wasn\\'t what was special about Einstein. What was special abouthim was that he had important new ideas. Being very smart was anecessary precondition for having those ideas, but the two are notidentical.It may seem a hair-splitting distinction to point out that intelligenceand its consequences are not identical, but it isn\\'t. There\\'s a biggap between them. Anyone who\\'s spent time around universities andresearch labs knows how big. There are a lot of genuinely smartpeople who don\\'t achieve very much.I grew up thinking that being smart was the thing most to be desired.Perhaps you did too. But I bet it\\'s not what you really want. Imagineyou had a choice between being really smart but discovering nothingnew, and being less smart but discovering lots of new ideas. Surelyyou\\'d take the latter. I would. The choice makes me uncomfortable,but when you see the two options laid out explicitly like that,it\\'s obvious which is better.The reason the choice makes me uncomfortable is that being smartstill feels like the thing that matters, even though I knowintellectually that it isn\\'t. I spent so many years thinking itwas. The circumstances of childhood are a perfect storm for fosteringthis illusion. Intelligence is much easier to measure than the valueof new ideas, and you\\'re constantly being judged by it. Whereaseven the kids who will ultimately discover new things aren\\'t usuallydiscovering them yet. For kids that way inclined, intelligence isthe only game in town.There are more subtle reasons too, which persist long into adulthood.Intelligence wins in conversation, and thus becomes the basis ofthe dominance hierarchy.Plus having new ideas is such a newthing historically, and even now done by so few people, that societyhasn\\'t yet assimilated the fact that this is the actual destination,and intelligence merely a means to an end.Why do so many smart people fail to discover anything new? Viewedfrom that direction, the question seems a rather depressing one.But there\\'s another way to look at it that\\'s not just more optimistic,but more interesting as well. Clearly intelligence is not the onlyingredient in having new ideas. What are the other ingredients?Are they things we could cultivate?Because the trouble with intelligence, they say, is that it\\'s mostlyinborn. The evidence for this seems fairly convincing, especiallyconsidering that most of us don\\'t want it to be true, and theevidence thus has to face a stiff headwind. But I\\'m not goingto get into that question here, because it\\'s the other ingredientsin new ideas that I care about, and it\\'s clear that many of themcan be cultivated.That means the truth is excitingly different from the story I gotas a kid. If intelligence is what matters, and also mostly inborn,the natural consequence is a sort ofBrave New Worldfatalism. Thebest you can do is figure out what sort of work you have an \"aptitude\"for, so that whatever intelligence you were born with will at leastbe put to the best use, and then work as hard as you can at it.Whereas if intelligence isn\\'t what matters, but only one of severalingredients in what does, and many of those aren\\'t inborn, thingsget more interesting. You have a lot more control, but the problemof how to arrange your life becomes that much more complicated.So what are the other ingredients in having new ideas? The factthat I can even ask this question proves the point I raised earlier— that society hasn\\'t assimilated the fact that it\\'s this and notintelligence that matters. Otherwise we\\'d all know the answersto such a fundamental question.I\\'m not going to try to provide a complete catalogue of the otheringredients here. This is the first time I\\'ve posedthe question to myself this way, and I think it may take a whileto answer. But I wrote recently about one of the most important:an obsessiveinterestin a particular topic. And this can definitely be cultivated.Another quality you need in order to discover new ideas isindependent-mindedness. I wouldn\\'t want to claim that this isdistinct from intelligence — I\\'d be reluctant to call someone smartwho wasn\\'t independent-minded — but though largely inborn, thisquality seems to be something that can be cultivated to some extent.There are general techniques for having new ideas — for example,for working on your ownprojectsandfor overcoming the obstacles you face withearlywork— and thesecan all be learned. Some of them can be learned by societies. Andthere are also collections of techniques for generating specific typesof new ideas, likestartup ideasandessay topics.And of course there are a lot of fairly mundane ingredients indiscovering new ideas, likeworking hard, getting enough sleep, avoiding certainkinds of stress, having the right colleagues, and finding tricksfor working on what you want even when it\\'s not what you\\'re supposedto be working on. Anything that prevents people from doing greatwork has an inverse that helps them to. And this class of ingredientsis not as boring as it might seem at first. For example, having newideas is generally associated with youth. But perhaps it\\'s not youthper se that yields new ideas, but specific things that come withyouth, like good health and lack of responsibilities. Investigatingthis might lead to strategies that will help people of any age tohave better ideas.One of the most surprising ingredients in having new ideas is writingability. There\\'s a class of new ideas that are best discovered bywriting essays and books. And that \"by\" is deliberate: you don\\'tthink of the ideas first, and then merely write them down. Thereis a kind of thinking that one does by writing, and if you\\'re clumsyat writing, or don\\'t enjoy doing it, that will get in your way ifyou try to do this kind of thinking.I predict the gap between intelligence and new ideas will turn outto be an interesting place. If we think of this gap merely as a measureof unrealized potential, it becomes a sort of wasteland that we try tohurry through with our eyes averted. But if we flip the question,and start inquiring into the other ingredients in new ideas thatit implies must exist, we can mine this gap for discoveries aboutdiscovery.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': \"some of thesmartest programmersI know are some of the least excited about it.My own feeling is that object-orientedprogramming is a useful technique in somecases, but it isn't something that has to pervade every program youwrite.  You should be able to define new types,but you shouldn't have to express every program as thedefinition of new types.I think there are five reasons people like object-oriented   programming, and three and a half of them are bad:Object-oriented programming is exciting   if you have a statically-typed language without lexical closures or macros.  To some degree, it offers a way around theselimitations.  (SeeGreenspun's Tenth Rule.)Object-oriented programming is popular in big companies,because it suits the way they write software.  At big companies,software tends to be written by large (and frequently changing)  teams ofmediocre programmers.  Object-oriented programming imposes adiscipline on these programmers that prevents any one of themfrom doing too much damage.  The price is that the resultingcode is bloated with protocols and full of duplication.  This is not too high a price for big companies, because theirsoftware is probably going to be bloated and full of duplication anyway.Object-orientedprogramming generates a lot of what looks like work.Back in the days of fanfold, there was a type of programmer whowould only put five or ten lines of code on a page, precededby twenty lines of elaborately formatted comments. Object-oriented programming is like crack for these people: it letsyou incorporate all this scaffolding right into your sourcecode.  Something that a Lisp hacker might handle by pushinga symbol onto a list becomes a whole file of classes andmethods.  So it is a good tool if you want to convince yourself,or someone else, that you are doing a lot of work.If a language is itself an object-oriented program, it canbe extended by users.  Well, maybe.  Or maybe you can doeven better by offering the sub-conceptsof object-oriented programming a la carte.  Overloading, for example, is not intrinsically tied to classes.  We'll see.Object-oriented abstractions map neatly onto the domainsof  certain specific kinds of programs, like simulations and CADsystems.I personally have never needed object-oriented abstractions.Common Lisp has an enormously powerful object system and I'venever used it once.  I've done a lot of things (e.g. making         hash tables full of closures) that would have required object-oriented techniques to do in wimpier languages, butI have never had to use CLOS.Maybe I'm just stupid, or have worked on some limited subsetof applications.  There is a danger in designing a languagebased on one's own experience of programming.  But it seemsmore dangerous to put stuff in that you've never needed because it's thought to be a good idea.Rees Re: OOSpanish Translation\"},\n",

       "  'essay_text': '(This is a new essay for the Japanese edition ofHackers & Painters.It tries to explain why Americans make some things well and others badly.)A few years ago an Italian friend of mine travelled by train fromBoston to Providence.  She had only been in America for acouple weeks and hadn\\'t seen much of the country yet.  She arrivedlooking astonished.  \"It\\'s sougly!\"People from other rich countries can scarcely imaginethe squalor of the man-made bits of America.  In travel booksthey show you mostly natural environments: the Grand Canyon,whitewater rafting, horses in a field.  If you seepictures with man-made things in them, it will be either aview of the New York skyline shot from a discreet distance,or a carefully cropped image of a seacoast town in Maine.How can it be, visitors must wonder.  How can the richest countryin the world look like this?Oddly enough, it may not be a coincidence.  Americans are goodat some things and bad at others.  We\\'re good at makingmovies and software, and bad at making cars and cities.And I think we may be good at what we\\'re good at for the samereason we\\'re bad at what we\\'re bad at.  We\\'re impatient.In America, if you want to do something, you don\\'t worry thatit might come out badly, or upset delicate social balances, orthat people might think you\\'re getting above yourself.  If youwant to do something, as Nike says,just do it.This works well in some fields and badly in others.  I suspectit works in movies and software because they\\'re both messy  processes.  \"Systematic\"is the last word I\\'d use to describe the waygood programmerswrite software.Code is not something they assemble painstakingly aftercareful planning, like the pyramids.  It\\'s something theyplunge into, working fast and constantly changing their minds,like a charcoal sketch.In software, paradoxicalas it sounds, good craftsmanship means working fast.If you work slowly and meticulously,you merely end up with a very fine implementation of your initial,mistaken idea.Working slowly and meticulously ispremature optimization.  Better to get aprototype done fast, and see what new ideasit gives you.It sounds like making movies works a lot like making software.Every movie is a Frankenstein, full of imperfectionsand usually quite different from what was originally envisioned.  But interesting, and finished fairly quickly.I think we get away with this in movies and softwarebecause they\\'re both malleable mediums.  Boldness pays.And if at the last minute two parts don\\'t quite   fit, you can figure out some hack that will at least concealthe problem.Not so with cars, or cities.  They are all too physical.If the car business worked like software or movies, you\\'dsurpass your competitors by making a car that weighed onlyfifty pounds, or folded up to the size of a motorcycle when   you wanted to park it.  But with physical products there aremore constraints.  You don\\'t win by dramatic innovationsso much as by good taste and attention to detail.The trouble is, the very word \"taste\"sounds slightly ridiculous to American ears.It seems pretentious, or frivolous, or even effeminate.Blue staters think it\\'s \"subjective,\" and red staters think it\\'s for sissies.  So anyone in Americawho really cares about design will be sailing upwind.Twenty years ago we used to hear that the problem withthe US car industry was the workers.We don\\'t hear that any more now that Japanese companiesare building cars in the US.   The problem withAmerican cars is bad design.  You can see that just bylooking at them.All that extra sheet metal on theAMC Matadorwasn\\'tadded by the workers.  The problemwith this car, as with American cars today, is that it wasdesigned by marketing people instead of designers.Why do the Japanese make better cars than us?  Some say it\\'sbecause their culture encourages cooperation.  That may comeinto it.   But in this case it seems more to the point thattheir culture prizes design and craftsmanship.For centuries the Japanese have made finer things than wehave in the West.  When you look at swords theymade in 1200, you just can\\'t believe the date on the labelis right.Presumably their cars fit together more   precisely than ours for the same reason their joinery always has.They\\'re obsessed with making things well.Not us.When we make something in America, our aim is just to get the   job done.  Once we reach that point, we take one of two routes.We can stop there, and have something crude butserviceable, like a Vise-grip.  Or we can improve it,which usually means encrusting it with gratuitous ornament.When we want to make a car \"better,\"we sticktail finson it, or make itlonger, or make thewindows smaller, depending on the current fashion.Ditto for houses.  In America you can have either a flimsy box bangedtogether out of two by fours and drywall, or a McMansion-- aflimsy box banged together out of two by fours and drywall,but larger, more dramatic-looking, and full of expensive fittings.Rich people don\\'t get better design or craftsmanship;they just get a larger, more conspicuous version of thestandard house.We don\\'t especially prize design or craftsmanship here.  Whatwe like is speed, and we\\'re willing to do something in an uglyway to get it done fast.  In somefields, like software or movies, this is a net win.But it\\'s not just that software and movies are malleable mediums.In those businesses, the designers (though they\\'renot generally called that) have more power.   Software companies, at least successful ones, tend to be runby programmers.  And in the film industry, though producersmay second-guess directors, the director controls most ofwhat appears on the screen.And so American software and movies, and Japanese cars, allhave this in common: the people in charge care aboutdesign-- the former because the designers are in charge, and the latterbecause the whole culture cares about design.I think most Japanese executives would be horrified atthe idea of making a bad car.  Whereas American executives,in their hearts, still believe the most important thing abouta car is the image it projects.Make a good car?  What\\'s \"good?\"  It\\'s sosubjective.If you want to know how to design a car, ask a focus group.Instead of relying on their own internal design compass(like Henry Ford did),American car companies try to make what marketing peoplethink consumers want.  But it isn\\'t working.  American cars continueto lose market share.  And the reason is that the customerdoesn\\'t want what he thinks he wants.Letting focus groups design your cars for you  only wins in the short term.  In the long term, it paysto bet on good design.  The focus group may say they want themeretricious feature du jour, but what they want even more isto imitate sophisticated buyers, and they, though asmall minority, really do care about good design.Eventually thepimps and drug dealers notice that the doctors and lawyershave switched from Cadillac to Lexus, and do the same.Apple is an interesting counterexample to the generalAmerican trend.  If you want to buy a nice CD player, you\\'llprobably buy a Japanese one.  But if you want to buy anMP3 player, you\\'ll probably buy an iPod.  What happened?Why doesn\\'t Sony dominate MP3 players?  Because Apple isin the consumer electronics business now, and unlikeother American companies, they\\'re obsessed with good design.

       "  'essay_text': 'About twenty years ago people noticed computers and TV were on acollision course and started to speculate about what they\\'d producewhen they converged.  We now know the answer: computers.  It\\'s clearnow that even by using the word \"convergence\" we were giving TV toomuch credit.  This won\\'t be convergence so much as replacement.People may still watch things they call \"TV shows,\" but they\\'llwatch them mostly on computers.What decided the contest for computers?  Four forces, three of whichone could have predicted, and one that would have been harder to.One predictable cause of victory is that the Internet is an openplatform.  Anyone can build whatever they want on it, and the marketpicks the winners.  So innovation happens at hacker speeds insteadof big company speeds.The second is Moore\\'s Law, which has worked its usual magic onInternet bandwidth.The third reason computers won is piracy. Users prefer it not just because it\\'s free, but because it\\'smore convenient.  Bittorrent and YouTube have already trained a newgeneration of viewers that the place to watch shows is on a computerscreen.The somewhat more surprising force was one specific type of innovation:social applications.  The average teenage kid has a pretty muchinfinite capacity for talking to their friends.  But they can\\'tphysically be with them all the time.  When I was in high schoolthe solution was the telephone.  Now it\\'s social networks, multiplayergames, and various messaging applications.  The way you reach themall is through a computer.Which means every teenage kid (a)wants a computer with an Internet connection, (b) has an incentiveto figure out how to use it, and (c) spends countless hours in frontof it.This was the most powerful force of all.  This was what made everyonewant computers.  Nerds got computers because they liked them.  Thengamers got them to play games on.  But it was connecting to otherpeople that got everyone else: that\\'s what made even grandmas and14 year old girls want computers.After decades of running an IV drip right into their audience,people in the entertainment business had understandably come tothink of them as rather passive.  They thought they\\'d be able todictate the way shows reached audiences.  But they underestimatedthe force of their desire to connect with one another.Facebook killed TV.  That is wildly oversimplified, of course, butprobably as close to the truth as you can get in three words.___The TV networks already seem, grudgingly, to see where things aregoing, and have responded by putting their stuff, grudgingly, online.But they\\'re still dragging their heels.  They still seem to wishpeople would watch shows on TV instead, just as newspapers that puttheir stories online still seem to wish people would wait till thenext morning and read them printed on paper.  They should both justface the fact that the Internet is the primary medium.They\\'d be in a better position if they\\'d done that earlier.  Whena new medium arises that\\'s powerful enough to make incumbentsnervous, then it\\'s probably powerful enough to win, and the bestthing they can do is jump in immediately.Whether they like it or not, big changes are coming, because theInternet dissolves the two cornerstones of broadcast media:synchronicity and locality.  On the Internet, you don\\'t have tosend everyone the same signal, and you don\\'t have to send it tothem from a local source.  People will watch what they want whenthey want it, and group themselves according to whatever sharedinterest they feel most strongly.  Maybe their strongest sharedinterest will be their physical location, but I\\'m guessing not.Which means local TV is probably dead.  It was an artifact oflimitations imposed by old technology.  If someone were creatingan Internet-based TV company from scratch now, they might have someplan for shows aimed at specific regions, but it wouldn\\'t be a toppriority.Synchronicity and locality are tied together.  TV network affiliatescare what\\'s on at 10 because that delivers viewers for local newsat 11.  This connection adds more brittleness than strength, however:people don\\'t watch what\\'s on at 10 because they want to watch thenews afterward.TV networks will fight these trends, because they don\\'t havesufficient flexibility to adapt to them.  They\\'re hemmed in by localaffiliates in much the same way car companies are hemmed in bydealers and unions.  Inevitably, the people running the networkswill take the easy route and try to keep the old model running fora couple more years, just as the record labels have done.A recent article in theWall Street Journaldescribed how TV networkswere trying to add more live shows, partly as a way to make viewerswatch TV synchronously instead of watching recorded shows when itsuited them.  Instead of delivering what viewers want, they\\'retrying to force them to change their habits to suit the networks\\'obsolete business model.  That never works unless you have a monopolyor cartel to enforce it, and even then it only works temporarily.The other reason networks like live shows is that they\\'re cheaperto produce.  There they have the right idea, but they haven\\'tfollowed it to its conclusion.   Live content can be way cheaperthan networks realize, and the way to take advantage of dramaticdecreases in cost is toincrease volume.  The networks are preventedfrom seeing this whole line of reasoning because they still thinkof themselves as being in the broadcast business—as sending onesignal to everyone.___Nowwould be a good time to start any company that competes withTV networks.  That\\'s what a lot of Internet startups are, thoughthey may not have had this as an explicit goal.  People only haveso many leisure hours a day, and TV is premised on such long sessions(unlike Google, which prides itself on sending users on their wayquickly) that anything that takes up their time is competing withit.  But in addition to such indirect competitors, I think TVcompanies will increasingly face direct ones.Even in cable TV, the long tail was lopped off prematurely by thethreshold you had to get over to start a new channel.  It will belonger on the Internet, and there will be more mobility within it.In this new world, the existing players will only have the advantagesany big company has in its market.That will change the balance of power between the networks and thepeople who produce shows.  The networks used to be gatekeepers.They distributed your work, and sold advertising on it.  Now thepeople who produce a show can distribute it themselves.  The mainvalue networks supply now is ad sales.  Which will tend to put themin the position of service providers rather than publishers.Shows will change even more.  On the Internet there\\'s no reason tokeep their current format, or even the fact that they have a singleformat.  Indeed, the more interesting sort of convergence that\\'scoming is between shows and games.  But on the question of whatsort of entertainment gets distributed on the Internet in 20 years,I wouldn\\'t dare to make any predictions, except that things willchange a lot.  We\\'ll get whatever the most imaginative people cancook up.  That\\'s why the Internet won.'},\n",

Here I want toexamine a more specific question: why were the exit polls so wrong?In Ohio, which Kerry ultimatelylost 49-51, exit polls gave him a 52-48 victory.  And this wasn\\'t justrandom error.  In every swing state they overestimated the Kerry vote.In Florida, which Bush ultimately won 52-47, exit polls predicteda dead heat.(These are not early numbers. They\\'re from about midnight eastern time, long after polls closed in Ohio and Florida.  And yet by thenext afternoon the exit poll numbers online corresponded to the returns.  The only way I can imagine this happening is if those incharge of the exit polls cooked the books after seeing the actualreturns.  But that\\'s another issue.)What happened?  The source of the problem may be a variant ofthe Bradley Effect.  This termwas invented after Tom Bradley, the black mayor of Los Angeles, lost an election for governor of California despite a comfortablelead in the polls.  Apparently voters were afraid to say  they planned to vote against him, lest their motives be(perhaps correctly) suspected.It seems likely that something similar happened in exit polls this year.In theory, exit polls ought to be very accurate.  You\\'re not asking people what they would do.  You\\'reasking what they just did.How can you get errors asking that?  Because some people don\\'trespond.  To get a truly random sample, pollsters ask, say, every20th person leaving the polling place who they voted for.  But noteveryone wants to answer.  And the pollsters can\\'t simply ignorethose who won\\'t, or their sample isn\\'t random anymore.  So whatthey do, apparently, is note down the age and race and sex of theperson, and guess from that who they voted for.This works so long as there is nocorrelationbetween who peoplevote for and whether they\\'re willing to talk about it.  But thisyear there may have been.  It may be that a significant number of those who voted forBush didn\\'t want to say so.Why not?  Because people in the US are more conservative than they\\'rewilling to admit.  The values of the elite in this country, at leastat the moment, are NPR values.  The average person, as I think bothRepublicans and Democrats would agree, is more socially conservative.  But while some openly flaunt the fact that they don\\'t share theopinions of the elite, others feel a little nervous about it, as if they had bad table manners.For example, according to current NPR values, youcan\\'t sayanything that might be perceived as disparaging towards homosexuals.  To do  so is \"homophobic.\"  And yet a large number of Americans are deeplyreligious, and the Bible is quite explicit on the subject ofhomosexuality.  What are they to do?  I think what many do is keep their opinions, but keep them to themselves.They know what they believe, but they also know what they\\'re supposedto believe.And so when a stranger (for example, a pollster) asksthem their opinion about something like gay marriage, they will notalways say what they really think.When the values of the elite are liberal, polls will tend tounderestimate the conservativeness of ordinary voters.  This seemsto me the leading theory to explain why the exit polls were so far off this year.  NPR values   said one ought to vote for Kerry.  So all the people who voted forKerry felt virtuous for doing so, and were eager to tell pollstersthey had. No one who voted for Kerry did it as an act of quietdefiance.Support for a Woman PresidentJapanese TranslationIf you liked this, you may also likeHackers & Painters.'},\n",

       "  'date': '1993',\n",
       "  'essay_text': '(This essay is from the introduction toOn Lisp.)It\\'s a long-standing principle of programming style that the functionalelements of a program should not be too large.  If some component of aprogram grows beyond the stage where it\\'s readily comprehensible,it becomes a mass of complexity which conceals errors as easilyas a big city conceals fugitives.  Such software will behard to read, hard to test, and hard to debug.In accordance with this principle, a large program must be dividedinto pieces, and the larger the program, the more it must be divided.How do you divide a program?  The traditional approach iscalledtop-down design:you say \"the purpose of theprogram is to do these seven things, so I divide it into seven majorsubroutines.  The first subroutine has to do these four things, soit in turn will have four of its own subroutines,\" and so on.This process continues until the whole program has the right levelof granularity-- each part large enough to do something substantial,but small enough to be understood as a single unit.Experienced Lisp programmers divide up their programs differently.As well as top-down design, they follow a principle whichcould be calledbottom-up design-- changing the languageto suit the problem.In Lisp, you don\\'t just write your program down toward the language,you also build the language up toward your program.  As you\\'rewriting a program you may think \"I wish Lisp had such-and-such anoperator.\" So you go and write it. Afterwardyou realize that using the new operator would simplify the design  of another part of the program, and so on.Language and program evolve together.Like the border between two warring states,the boundary between language and program is drawn and redrawn,until eventually it comes to rest along the mountains and rivers,the natural frontiers of your problem.In the end your program will look as if the language had beendesigned for it.And when language andprogram fit one another well, you end up with code which isclear, small, and efficient.It\\'s worth emphasizing that bottom-up design doesn\\'t meanjust writing the same program in a different order.  When youwork bottom-up, you usually end up with a different program.Instead of a single, monolithic program,you will get a larger language with more abstract operators,   and a smaller program written in it.  Instead of a lintel,you\\'ll get an arch.In typical code, once you abstract out the parts which aremerely bookkeeping, what\\'s left is much shorter;the higher you build up the language, the less distance youwill have to travel from the top down to it.This brings several advantages:By making the language do more of the work, bottom-up designyields programs which are smaller and more agile.  A shorterprogram doesn\\'t have to be divided into so many components, andfewer components means programs which are easier to read ormodify.  Fewer components also means fewer connections between   components, and thus less chance for errors there.  Asindustrial designers strive to reduce the number of moving partsin a machine, experienced Lisp programmers use bottom-up designto reduce the size and complexity of their programs.Bottom-up design promotes code re-use.When you write twoor more programs, many of the utilities you wrote for the firstprogram will also be useful in the succeeding ones.  Once you\\'ve  acquired a large substrate of utilities, writing a new program cantake only a fraction of the effort it would require if you had to start with raw Lisp.Bottom-up design makes programs easier to read.An instance of this typeof abstraction asks the reader to understand a general-purpose operator;an instance of functional abstraction asks the reader to understanda special-purpose subroutine. [1]Because it causes you always to be on the lookout for patternsin your code, working bottom-up helps to clarify your ideas aboutthe design of your program.  If two distant components of a programare similar in form, you\\'ll be led to notice the similarity andperhaps to redesign the program in a simpler way.Bottom-up design is possible to a certain degree in languagesother than Lisp.  Whenever you see library functions,bottom-up design is happening.  However, Lisp gives you much broaderpowers in this department, and augmenting the language plays aproportionately larger role in Lisp style-- so much so thatLisp is not just a different language, but a whole different wayof programming.It\\'s true that this style of development is better suited toprograms which can be written by small groups.  However, at thesame time, it extends the limits of what can be done by a smallgroup.  InThe Mythical Man-Month,Frederick Brooksproposed that the productivity of a group of programmersdoes not grow linearly with its size.  As the size of thegroup increases, the productivity of individual programmersgoes down.  The experience of Lisp programming  suggests a more cheerful wayto phrase this law: as the size of the group decreases, theproductivity of individual programmers goes up.A small group wins, relatively speaking, simply because it\\'ssmaller.  When a small group also takes advantage of thetechniques that Lisp makes possible, it canwin outright.New:Download On Lisp for Free.[1] \"But no one can readthe program without understanding all your new utilities.\"To see why such statements are usually mistaken,see Section 4.8.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'A few months ago I read aNew York Timesarticle on SouthKorean cram schools that saidAdmission to the right university can make or break an ambitious  young South Korean.A parent added:\"In our country, college entrance exams determine 70 to 80 percent  of a person\\'s future.\"It was striking how old fashioned this sounded.  Andyet when I was in high school it wouldn\\'t have seemed too far offas a description of the US.  Which means things must have beenchanging here.The course of people\\'s lives in the US now seems to be determinedless by credentials and more by performance than it was 25 yearsago.  Where you go to college still matters, but not like it usedto.What happened?_____Judging people by their academic credentials was in its time anadvance.  The practice seems to have begun in China, where startingin 587 candidates for the imperial civil service had to take anexam on classical literature.It was also a test of wealth,because the knowledge it tested was so specialized that passingrequired years of expensive training.  But though wealth was anecessary condition for passing, it was not a sufficient one.  Bythe standards of the rest of the world in 587, the Chinese systemwas very enlightened.  Europeans didn\\'t introduce formal civilservice exams till the nineteenth century, and even then they seemto have been influenced by the Chinese example.Before credentials, government positions were obtained mainly byfamily influence, if not outright bribery.   It was a great stepforward to judge people by their performance on a test.  But by nomeans a perfect solution.  When you judge people that way, you tendto get cram schools—which they did in Ming China and nineteenthcentury England just as much as in present day South Korea.What cram schools are, in effect, is leaks in a seal.  The use ofcredentialswas an attempt to seal off the direct transmission of power betweengenerations, and cram schools represent that power finding holesin the seal.  Cram schools turn wealth in one generation intocredentials in the next.It\\'s hard to beat this phenomenon, because the schools adjust to suitwhatever the tests measure.  When the tests are narrow andpredictable, you get cram schools on the classic model, like thosethat prepared candidates for Sandhurst (the British West Point) orthe classes American students take now to improve their SAT scores.But as the tests get broader, the schools do too.  Preparing acandidate for the Chinese imperial civil service exams took years,as prep school does today.  But the raison d\\'etre of all theseinstitutions has been the same: to beat the system._____History suggests that, all other things being equal, a societyprospers in proportion to its ability to prevent parents frominfluencing their children\\'s success directly.  It\\'s a fine thingfor parents to help their children indirectly—for example,by helping them to become smarter or more disciplined, which thenmakes them more successful.  The problem comes when parents usedirect methods: when they are able to use their own wealth or poweras a substitute for their children\\'s qualities.Parents will tend to do this when they can.  Parents will die fortheir kids, so it\\'s not surprising to find they\\'ll also push theirscruples to the limits for them.  Especially if other parents aredoing it.Sealing off this force has a double advantage.  Not only does asociety get \"the best man for the job,\" butparents\\' ambitions are diverted from direct methods to indirectones—to actually trying to raise their kids well.But we should expect it to be very hard to contain parents\\' effortsto obtain an unfair advantage for their kids.  We\\'re dealing withone of the most powerful forces in human nature.  We shouldn\\'t expectnaive solutions to work, any more than we\\'d expect naive solutionsfor keeping heroin out of a prison to work._____The obvious way to solve the problem is to make credentials better.If the tests a society uses are currently hackable, we can studythe way people beat them and try to plug the holes.  You can usethe cram schools to show you where most of the holes are.  Theyalso tell you when you\\'re succeeding in fixing them: when cramschools become less popular.A more general solutionwould be to push for increased transparency, especially at criticalsocial bottlenecks like college admissions.  In the US this processstill shows many outward signs of corruption.  For example, legacyadmissions.  The official story is that legacy status doesn\\'t carrymuch weight, because all it does is break ties: applicants arebucketed by ability, and legacy status is only used to decide betweenthe applicants in the bucket that straddles the cutoff.  But whatthis means is that a university can make legacy status have as muchor as little weight as they want, by adjusting the size of thebucket that straddles the cutoff.By gradually chipping away at the abuse of credentials, you couldprobably make them more airtight.  But what a long fight it wouldbe.  Especially when the institutions administering the tests don\\'treally want them to be airtight._____Fortunately there\\'s a better way to prevent the direct transmissionof power between generations.  Instead of trying to make credentialsharder to hack, we can also make them matter less.Let\\'s think about what credentials are for.  What they are,functionally, is a way of predicting performance.  If you couldmeasure actual performance, you wouldn\\'t need them.So why did they even evolve?  Why haven\\'t we just been measuringactual performance?  Think about where credentialism first appeared:in selecting candidates for large organizations.  Individualperformance is hard to measure in large organizations, and theharder performance is to measure, the more important it isto predict it.  If an organization could immediately and cheaplymeasure the performance of recruits, they wouldn\\'t need to examinetheir credentials.  They could take everyone and keep just the goodones.Large organizations can\\'t do this.  But a bunch of small organizationsin a market can come close.  A market takes every organization andkeeps just the good ones.  As organizations get smaller, thisapproaches taking every person and keeping just the good ones.  Soall other things being equal, a society consisting of more, smallerorganizations will care less about credentials._____That\\'s what\\'s been happening in the US.  That\\'s why those quotesfrom Korea sound so old fashioned.  They\\'re talking about an economylike America\\'s a few decades ago, dominated by a few big companies.The route for the ambitious in that sort of environment is to joinone and climb to the top.  Credentials matter a lot then.  In the culture of a large organization, an elite pedigree becomes a self-fulfillingprophecy.This doesn\\'t work in small companies.  Even if your colleagues wereimpressed by your credentials, they\\'d soon be parted from you ifyour performance didn\\'t match, because the company would go out ofbusiness and the people would be dispersed.In a world of small companies, performance is all anyone caresabout.  People hiring for a startup don\\'t care whether you\\'ve evengraduated from college, let alone which one.  All they care aboutis what you can do.  Which is in fact all that should matter, evenin a large organization.  The reason credentials have such prestigeis that for so long the large organizationsin a society tended to be the most powerful.  But in the US at leastthey don\\'t have the monopoly on power they once did, preciselybecause they can\\'t measure (and thus reward) individual performance.Why spend twenty years climbing the corporate ladder when you canget rewarded directly by the market?I realize I see a more exaggerated version of the change than mostother people.  As a partner at an early stage venture funding firm,I\\'m like a jumpmaster shoving people out of the old world ofcredentials and into the new one of performance.  I\\'m an agent ofthe change I\\'m seeing.  But I don\\'t think I\\'m imagining it.  It wasnot so easy 25 years ago for an ambitious person to choose to bejudged directly by the market.  You had to go through bosses, andthey were influenced by where you\\'d been to college._____What made it possible for small organizations to succeed in America?I\\'m still not entirely sure.  Startups are certainly a large partof it.  Small organizations can develop new ideas faster than largeones, and new ideas are increasingly valuable.But I don\\'t think startups account for all the shift from credentialsto measurement.  My friend Julian Weber told me that when he wentto work for a New York law firm in the 1950s they paid associatesfar less than firms do today.  Law firms then made no pretense ofpaying people according to the value of the work they\\'d done.  Paywas based on seniority.  The younger employees were paying theirdues.  They\\'d be rewarded later.The same principle prevailed at industrial companies.  When myfather was working at Westinghouse in the 1970s, he had peopleworking for him who made more than he did, because they\\'d been therelonger.Now companies increasingly have to pay employees market price forthe work they do.   One reason is that employees no longer trustcompanies to deliverdeferred rewards: why work to accumulatedeferred rewards at a company that might go bankrupt, or be takenover and have all its implicit obligations wiped out?  The otheris that some companies broke ranks and started to pay young employeeslarge amounts.  This was particularly true in consulting, law, andfinance, where it led to the phenomenon of yuppies.  The word israrely used today because it\\'s no longer surprising to see a 25year old with money, but in 1985 the sight of a 25 year oldprofessionalable to afford a new BMW was so novel that itcalled forth a new word.The classic yuppie worked for a small organization.  He didn\\'t workfor General Widget, but for the law firm that handled GeneralWidget\\'s acquisitions or the investment bank that floated theirbond issues.Startups and yuppies entered the American conceptual vocabularyroughly simultaneously in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  I don\\'tthink there was a causal connection.  Startups happened becausetechnology started to change so fast that big companies could nolonger keep a lid on the smaller ones.  I don\\'t think the rise ofyuppies was inspired by it; it seems more as if there was a changein the social conventions (and perhaps the laws) governing the waybig companies worked.  But the two phenomena rapidly fused to producea principle that now seems obvious: paying energetic young peoplemarket rates, and getting correspondingly high performance fromthem.At about the same time the US economy rocketed out of the doldrumsthat had afflicted it for most of the 1970s.  Was there a connection?I don\\'t know enough to say, but it felt like it at the time.  Therewas a lot of energy released._____Countries worried about their competitiveness are right to beconcerned about the number of startups started within them.  Butthey would do even better to examine the underlying principle.  Dothey let energetic young people get paid market rate for the workthey do?  The young are the test, because when people aren\\'t rewardedaccording to performance, they\\'re invariably rewarded according toseniority instead.All it takes is a few beachheads in your economy that pay forperformance.  Measurement spreads like heat.  If one part of asociety is better at measurement than others, it tends to push theothers to do better.  If people who are young but smart and drivencan make more by starting their own companies than by working forexisting ones, the existing companies are forced to pay more tokeep them.  So market rates gradually permeate every organization,even the government.The measurement of performance will tend to push even the organizationsissuing credentials into line.  When we were kids I used to annoymy sister by ordering her to do things I knew she was about to doanyway.  As credentials are superseded by performance, a similarrole is the best former gatekeepers can hope for.  Once credentialgranting institutions are no longer in the self-fullfilling prophecybusiness, they\\'ll have to work harder to predict the future._____Credentials are a step beyond bribery and influence.  But they\\'renot the final step.  There\\'s an even better way to block thetransmission of power between generations: to encourage the trendtoward an economy made of more, smaller units.  Then you can measurewhat credentials merely predict.No one likes the transmission of power between generations—notthe left or the right.  But the market forces favored by the rightturn out to be a better way of preventing it than the credentialsthe left are forced to fall back on.The era of credentials began to end when the power of largeorganizationspeakedin the late twentieth century.  Now we seemto be entering a new era based on measurement.  The reason the newmodel has advanced so rapidly is that it works so much better.  Itshows no sign of slowing.'},\n",

Butall art has to work on an audience, and—here\\'s the critical point—members of the audience share things in common.For example, nearly all humans find human faces engaging.  It seemsto be wired into us.  Babies can recognize faces practically frombirth.  In fact, faces seem to have co-evolved with our interestin them; the face is the body\\'s billboard.  So all other thingsbeing equal, a painting with faces in it will interest people morethan one without.One reason it\\'s easy to believe that taste is merely personalpreference is that, if it isn\\'t, how do you pick out the peoplewith better taste?  There are billions of people, each with theirown opinion; on what grounds can you prefer one to another?But if audiences have a lot in common, you\\'re not in a position ofhaving to choose one out of a random set of individual biases,because the set isn\\'t random.  All humans find faces engaging—practically by definition: face recognition is in our DNA.  And sohaving a notion of good art, in the sense of art that does its jobwell, doesn\\'t require you to pick out a few individuals and labeltheir opinions as correct.  No matter who you pick, they\\'ll findfaces engaging.Of course, space aliens probably wouldn\\'t find human faces engaging.But there might be other things they shared in common with us.  Themost likely source of examples is math.  I expect space aliens wouldagree with us most of the time about which of two proofs was better.Erdos thought so.  He called a maximally elegant proof one out ofGod\\'s book, and presumably God\\'s book is universal.Once you start talking about audiences, you don\\'t have to arguesimply that there are or aren\\'t standards of taste.  Instead tastesare a series of concentric rings, like ripples in a pond.  Thereare some things that will appeal to you and your friends, othersthat will appeal to most people your age, others that will appealto most humans, and perhaps others that would appeal to most sentientbeings (whatever that means).The picture is slightly more complicated than that, because in themiddle of the pond there are overlapping sets of ripples.  Forexample, there might be things that appealed particularly to men,or to people from a certain culture.If good art is art that interests its audience, then when you talkabout art being good, you also have to say for what audience.  Sois it meaningless to talk about art simply being good or bad?  No,because one audience is the set of all possible humans.  I thinkthat\\'s the audience people are implicitly talking about when theysay a work of art is good: they mean it would engage any human.And that is a meaningful test, because although, like any everydayconcept, \"human\" is fuzzy around the edges, there are a lot ofthings practically all humans have in common.  In addition to ourinterest in faces, there\\'s something special about primary colorsfor nearly all of us, because it\\'s an artifact of the way our eyeswork.  Most humans will also find images of 3D objects engaging,because that also seems to be built into our visual perception.And beneath that there\\'s edge-finding, which makes imageswith definite shapes more engaging than mere blur.Humans have a lot more in common than this, of course.  My goal isnot to compile a complete list, just to show that there\\'s some solidground here.  People\\'s preferences aren\\'t random.  So an artistworking on a painting and trying to decide whether to change somepart of it doesn\\'t have to think \"Why bother?  I might as well flipa coin.\" Instead he can ask \"What would make the painting moreinteresting to people?\"  And the reason you can\\'t equal Michelangeloby going out and buying a blank canvas is that the ceiling of theSistine Chapel is more interesting to people.A lot of philosophers have had a hard time believing it was possiblefor there to be objective standards for art. It seemed obvious thatbeauty, for example, was something that happened in the head of the observer,not something that was a property of objects.  It was thus \"subjective\" rather than \"objective.\"  But in fact if you narrow thedefinition of beauty to something that works a certain way onhumans, and you observe how much humans have in common, it turns outto be a property of objects after all.   You don\\'thave to choose between something being a property of the   subject or the object if subjects all react similarly.Being good art is thus a property of objects as much as, say, beingtoxic to humans is: it\\'s good art if it consistently affects humans in a certain way.ErrorSo could we figure out what the best art is by taking a vote?  Afterall, if appealing to humans is the test, we should be able to justask them, right?Well, not quite.  For products of nature that might work.  I\\'d bewilling to eat the apple the world\\'s population had voted mostdelicious, and I\\'d probably be willing to visit the beach they votedmost beautiful, but having to look at the painting they voted thebest would be a crapshoot.Man-made stuff is different.  For one thing, artists, unlike appletrees, often deliberately try to trick us.  Some tricks are quitesubtle.  For example, any work of art sets expectations by its levelof finish.  You don\\'t expect photographic accuracy in somethingthat looks like a quick sketch.  So one widely used trick, especiallyamong illustrators, is to intentionally make a painting or drawinglook like it was done faster than it was.  The average person looksat it and thinks: how amazingly skillful.  It\\'s like saying somethingclever in a conversation as if you\\'d thought of it on the spur ofthe moment, when in fact you\\'d worked it out the day before.Another much less subtle influence is brand.  If you go to see theMona Lisa, you\\'ll probably be disappointed, because it\\'s hiddenbehind a thick glass wall and surrounded by a frenzied crowd takingpictures of themselves in front of it.  At best you can see it theway you see a friend across the room at a crowded party.  The Louvremight as well replace it with copy; no one would be able to tell.And yet the Mona Lisa is a small, dark painting.  If you foundpeople who\\'d never seen an image of it and sent them to a museumin which it was hanging among other paintings with a tag labellingit as a portrait by an unknown fifteenth century artist, most wouldwalk by without giving it a second look.For the average person, brand dominates all other factors in thejudgement of art.  Seeing a painting they recognize from reproductionsis so overwhelming that their response to it as a painting is drownedout.And then of course there are the tricks people play on themselves.Most adults looking at art worry that if they don\\'t like what they\\'resupposed to, they\\'ll be thought uncultured.  This doesn\\'t justaffect what they claim to like; they actually make themselves likethings they\\'re supposed to.That\\'s why you can\\'t just take a vote.  Though appeal to people isa meaningful test, in practice you can\\'t measure it, just as youcan\\'t find north using a compass with a magnet sitting next to it.There are sources of error so powerful that if you take a vote, allyou\\'re measuring is the error.We can, however, approach our goal from another direction, by usingourselves as guinea pigs.  You\\'re human.  If you want to know whatthe basic human reaction to a piece of art would be, you can atleast approach that by getting rid of the sources of error in yourown judgements.For example, while anyone\\'s reaction to a famous painting will bewarped at first by its fame, there are ways to decrease its effects.One is to come back to the painting over and over.  After a fewdays the fame wears off, and you can start to see it as a painting.Another is to stand close.  A painting familiar from reproductionslooks more familiar from ten feet away; close in you see detailsthat get lost in reproductions, and which you\\'re therefore seeingfor the first time.There are two main kinds of error that get in the way of seeing awork of art: biases you bring from your own circumstances, andtricks played by the artist.  Tricks are straightforward to correctfor. Merely being aware of them usually prevents them from working.For example, when I was ten I used to be very impressed by airbrushedlettering that looked like shiny metal.  But once you study howit\\'s done, you see that it\\'s a pretty cheesy trick—one of thesort that relies on pushing a few visual buttons really hard totemporarily overwhelm the viewer.  It\\'s like trying to convincesomeone by shouting at them.The way not to be vulnerable to tricks is to explicitly seek outand catalog them.  When you notice a whiff of dishonesty comingfrom some kind of art, stop and figure out what\\'s going on.  Whensomeone is obviously pandering to an audience that\\'s easily fooled,whether it\\'s someone making shiny stuff to impress ten year olds,or someone making conspicuously avant-garde stuff to impress would-beintellectuals, learn how they do it.  Once you\\'ve seen enoughexamples of specific types of tricks, you start to become a connoisseurof trickery in general, just as professional magicians are.What counts as a trick?  Roughly, it\\'s something done with contemptfor the audience.  For example, the guys designing Ferraris in the1950s were probably designing cars that they themselves admired.Whereas I suspect over at General Motors the marketing people aretelling the designers, \"Most people who buy SUVs do it to seemmanly, not to drive off-road. So don\\'t worry about the suspension;just make that sucker as big and tough-looking as you can.\"I think with some effort you can make yourself nearly immune totricks.  It\\'s harder to escape the influence of your own circumstances,but you can at least move in that direction.  The way to do it isto travel widely, in both time and space.  If you go and see allthe different kinds of things people like in other cultures, andlearn about all the different things people have liked in the past,you\\'ll probably find it changes what you like.  I doubt you couldever make yourself into a completely universal person, if onlybecause you can only travel in one direction in time.  But if youfind a work of art that would appeal equally to your friends, topeople in Nepal, and to the ancient Greeks, you\\'re probably ontosomething.My main point here is not how to have good taste, but that therecan even be such a thing.  And I think I\\'ve shown that.  There issuch a thing as good art. It\\'s art that interests its human audience,and since humans have a lot in common, what interests them is notrandom.  Since there\\'s such a thing as good art, there\\'salso such a thing as good taste, which is the ability to recognizeit.If we were talking about the taste of apples, I\\'d agree that tasteis just personal preference.  Some people like certain kinds ofapples and others like other kinds, but how can you say that oneis right and the other wrong?The thing is, art isn\\'t apples.  Art is man-made. It comes with alot of cultural baggage, and in addition the people who make itoften try to trick us.  Most people\\'s judgement of art is dominatedby these extraneous factors; they\\'re like someone trying to judgethe taste of apples in a dish made of equal parts apples and jalapenopeppers.  All they\\'re tasting is the peppers.  So it turns out youcan pick out some people and say that they have better taste thanothers: they\\'re the ones who actually taste art like apples.Or to put it more prosaically, they\\'re the people who (a) are hardto trick, and (b) don\\'t just like whatever they grew up with.  Ifyou could find people who\\'d eliminated all such influences on theirjudgement, you\\'d probably still see variation in what they liked.But because humans have so much in common, you\\'d also find theyagreed on a lot.  They\\'d nearly all prefer the ceiling of the SistineChapel to a blank canvas.Making ItI wrote this essay because I was tired of hearing \"taste is subjective\"and wanted to kill it once and for all. Anyone who makes thingsknows intuitively that\\'s not true.  When you\\'re trying to make art,the temptation to be lazy is as great as in any other kind of work.Of course it matters to do a good job.  And yet you can see howgreat a hold \"taste is subjective\" has even in the art world by hownervous it makes people to talk about art being good or bad.  Thosewhose jobs require them to judge art, like curators, mostly resortto euphemisms like \"significant\" or \"important\" or (getting dangerouslyclose) \"realized.\"I don\\'t have any illusions that being able to talk about art beinggood or bad will cause the people who talk about it to have anythingmore useful to say.  Indeed, one of the reasons \"taste is subjective\"found such a receptive audience is that, historically, the thingspeople have said about good taste have generally been such nonsense.It\\'s not for the people who talk about art that I want to free theidea of good art, but for those whomakeit.  Right now, ambitiouskids going to art school run smack into a brick wall.  They arrivehoping one day to be as good as the famous artists they\\'ve seen inbooks, and the first thing they learn is that the concept of goodhas been retired.  Instead everyone is just supposed to exploretheir own personal vision.When I was in art school, we were looking one day at a slide ofsome great fifteenth century painting, and one of the students asked\"Why don\\'t artists paint like that now?\" The room suddenly gotquiet.  Though rarely asked out loud, this question lurks uncomfortablyin the back of every art student\\'s mind.  It was as if someone hadbrought up the topic of lung cancer in a meeting within PhilipMorris.\"Well,\" the professor replied, \"we\\'re interested in differentquestions now.\"  He was a pretty nice guy, but at the time I couldn\\'thelp wishing I could send him back to fifteenth century Florenceto explain in person to Leonardo & Co. how we had moved beyond theirearly, limited concept of art.  Just imagine that conversation.In fact, one of the reasons artists in fifteenth century Florence madesuch great things was that they believed you could make great things.They were intensely competitive and were always trying to outdoone another, like mathematicians or physicists today—maybe likeanyone who has ever done anything really well.The idea that you could make great things was not just a usefulillusion.  They were actually right.  So the most important consequenceof realizing there can be good art is that it frees artists to tryto make it.  To the ambitious kids arriving at art school this yearhoping one day to make great things, I say: don\\'t believe it whenthey tell you this is a naive and outdated ambition.  There is sucha thing as good art, and if you try to make it, there are peoplewho will notice.'},\n",

       "  'date': 'December 2019',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'There are two distinct ways to be politically moderate: on purposeand by accident. Intentional moderates are trimmers, deliberatelychoosing a position mid-way between the extremes of right and left.Accidental moderates end up in the middle, on average, because theymake up their own minds about each question, and the far right andfar left are roughly equally wrong.You can distinguish intentional from accidental moderates by thedistribution of their opinions. If the far left opinion on somematter is 0 and the far right opinion 100, an intentional moderate\\'sopinion on every question will be near 50. Whereas an accidentalmoderate\\'s opinions will be scattered over a broad range, but will,like those of the intentional moderate, average to about 50.Intentional moderates are similar to those on the far left and thefar right in that their opinions are, in a sense, not their own.The defining quality of an ideologue, whether on the left or theright, is to acquire one\\'s opinions in bulk. You don\\'t get to pickand choose. Your opinions about taxation can be predicted from youropinions about sex. And although intentional moderatesmight seem to be the opposite of ideologues, their beliefs (thoughin their case the word \"positions\" might be more accurate) are alsoacquired in bulk. If the median opinion shifts to the right or left,the intentional moderate must shift with it. Otherwise they stopbeing moderate.Accidental moderates, on the other hand, not only choose their ownanswers, but choose their own questions. They may not care at allabout questions that the left and right both think are terriblyimportant. So you can only even measure the politics of an accidentalmoderate from the intersection of the questions they care about andthose the left and right care about, and this cansometimes be vanishingly small.It is not merely a manipulative rhetorical trick to say \"if you\\'renot with us, you\\'re against us,\" but often simply false.Moderates are sometimes derided as cowards, particularly by the extreme left. But while it may be accurate to call intentionalmoderates cowards, openly being an accidental moderate requires themost courage of all, because you get attacked from both right andleft, and you don\\'t have the comfort of being an orthodox memberof a large group to sustain you.Nearly all the most impressive people I know are accidental moderates.If I knew a lot of professional athletes, or people in the entertainmentbusiness, that might be different. Being on the far left or farright doesn\\'t affect how fast you run or how well you sing. Butsomeone who works with ideas has to be independent-minded to do itwell.Or more precisely, you have to be independent-minded about the ideasyou work with. You could be mindlessly doctrinaire in your politicsand still be a good mathematician. In the 20th century, a lot ofvery smart people were Marxists — just no one who was smart aboutthe subjects Marxism involves. But if the ideas you use in yourwork intersect with the politics of your time, you have two choices:be an accidental moderate, or be mediocre.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'Why to Move to a Startup Hub',\n",
       "  'date': 'October 2007',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'After the lasttalkI gave, one of the organizers got up on thestage to deliver an impromptu rebuttal.  That never happened before.I only heard the first few sentences, but that was enough to tellwhat I said that upset him: that startups would do better if theymoved to Silicon Valley.This conference was in London, and most of the audience seemed tobe from the UK.  So saying startups should move to Silicon Valleyseemed like a nationalistic remark: an obnoxious American tellingthem that if they wanted to do things right they should all justmove to America.Actually I\\'m less American than I seem.  I didn\\'t say so, but I\\'mBritish by birth.  And just as Jews are ex officio allowed to tellJewish jokes, I don\\'t feel like I have to bother being diplomaticwith a British audience.The idea that startups would do better to move to Silicon Valleyis not even a nationalistic one.It\\'s the same thing I say tostartups in the US.  Y Combinator alternates between coasts every6 months. Every other funding cycle is in Boston.  And even thoughBoston is the second biggest startup hub in the US (and the world),we tell the startups from those cycles that their best bet is tomove to Silicon Valley.  If that\\'s true of Boston, it\\'s even moretrue of every other city.This is about cities, not countries.And I think I can prove I\\'m right.  You can easily reduce theopposing argument ad what most people would agree was absurdum.Few would be willing to claim that it doesn\\'t matter at all wherea startup is—that a startup operating out of a small agriculturaltown wouldn\\'t benefit from moving to a startup hub.  Most peoplecould see how it might be helpful to be in a place where there wasinfrastructure for startups, accumulated knowledge about how tomake them work, and other people trying to do it.  And yet whateverargument you use to prove that startups don\\'t need to move fromLondon to Silicon Valley could equally well be used to prove startupsdon\\'t need to move from smaller towns to London.The difference between cities is a matter of degree.  And if, asnearly everyone who knows agrees, startups are better off in SiliconValley than Boston, then they\\'re better off in Silicon Valley thaneverywhere else too.I realize I might seem to have a vested interest in this conclusion,because startups that move to the US might do it through Y Combinator.But the American startups we\\'ve funded will attest that I say thesame thing to them.I\\'m not claiming of course that every startup has to go to SiliconValley to succeed.  Just that all other things being equal, themore of a startup hub a place is, the better startups will do there.But other considerations can outweigh the advantages of moving.I\\'m not saying founders with families should uproot them to movehalfway around the world; that might be too much of a distraction.Immigration difficulties might be another reason to stay put.Dealing with immigration problems is like raising money: for somereason it seems to consume all your attention.  A startup can\\'tafford much of that.  One Canadian startup we funded spent about 6months working on moving to the US.  Eventually they just gave up,because they couldn\\'t afford to take so much time away from workingon their software.(If another country wanted to establish a rival to Silicon Valley,the single best thing they could do might be to create a specialvisa for startup founders.  US immigration policy is one of Silicon Valley\\'s biggest weaknesses.)If your startup is connected to a specific industry, you may bebetter off in one of its centers.  A startup doing something relatedto entertainment might want to be in New York or LA.And finally, if a good investor has committed to fundyou if you stay where you are, you should probably stay.  Findinginvestors is hard.  You generally shouldn\\'t pass up a definitefunding offer to move.In fact, the quality of the investors may be the main advantage ofstartup hubs.  Silicon Valley investors are noticeably more aggressivethan Boston ones.  Over and over, I\\'ve seen startups we\\'ve fundedsnatched by west coast investors out from under the noses of Bostoninvestors who saw them first but acted too slowly.  At this year\\'sBoston Demo Day, I told the audience that this happened every year,so if they saw a startup they liked, they should make them an offer.And yet within a month it had happened again: an aggressive westcoast VC who had met the founder of a YC-funded startup a weekbefore beat out a Boston VC who had known him for years.  By thetime the Boston VC grasped what was happening, the deal was alreadygone.Boston investors will admit they\\'re more conservative.  Some wantto believe this comes from the city\\'s prudent Yankee character.But Occam\\'s razor suggests the truth is less flattering.  Bostoninvestors are probably more conservative than Silicon Valley investorsfor the same reason Chicago investors are more conservative thanBoston ones.  They don\\'t understand startups as well.West coast investors aren\\'t bolder because they\\'re irresponsiblecowboys, or because the good weather makes them optimistic.  They\\'rebolder because they know what they\\'re doing.  They\\'re the skierswho ski on the diamond slopes.  Boldness is the essence of ventureinvesting.  The way you get big returns is not by trying to avoidlosses, but by trying to ensure you get some of the big hits. Andthe big hits often look risky at first.Like Facebook.  Facebook was started in Boston.  Boston VCs had thefirst shot at them.  But they said no, so Facebook moved to SiliconValley and raised money there.  The partner who turned them downnow says that \"may turn out to have been a mistake.\"Empirically, boldness wins.  If the aggressive ways of west coastinvestors are going to come back to bite them, it has been a longtime coming.  Silicon Valley has been pulling ahead of Boston sincethe 1970s.  If there was going to be a comeuppance for the westcoast investors, the bursting of the Bubble would have been it.But since then the west coast has just pulled further ahead.West coast investors are confident enough of their judgement to actboldly; east coast investors, not so much; but anyone who thinkseast coast investors act that way out of prudence should see thefrantic reactions of an east coast VC in the process of losing adeal to a west coast one.In addition to the concentration that comes from specialization,startup hubs are also markets.  And markets are usually centralized.Even now, when traders could be anywhere, they cluster in a fewcities.  It\\'s hard to say exactly what it is about face to facecontact that makes deals happen, but whatever it is, it hasn\\'t yetbeen duplicated by technology.Walk down University Ave at the right time, and you might overhearfive different people talking on the phone about deals.  In fact,this is part of the reason Y Combinator is in Boston half the time:it\\'s hard to stand that year round.  But though it can sometimesbe annoying to be surrounded by people who only think about onething, it\\'s the place to be if that one thing is what you\\'re tryingto do.I was talking recently to someone who works on search at Google.He knew a lot of people at Yahoo, so he was in a good position tocompare the two companies.  I asked him why Google was better atsearch.  He said it wasn\\'t anything specific Google did, but simplythat they understood search so much better.And that\\'s why startups thrive in startup hubs like Silicon Valley.Startups are a very specialized business, as specialized as diamondcutting.  And in startup hubs they understand it.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'What the Bubble Got Right',\n",
       "  'date': 'September 2004',\n",
       "  'essay_text': '(This essay is derived from an invited talk at ICFP 2004.)I had a front row seat for the Internet Bubble,because I worked at Yahoo during 1998 and 1999.  One day,when the stock was trading around $200, I sat down and calculatedwhat I thought the price should be. The answer I got was $12.  I went tothe next cubicle and told my friend Trevor.  \"Twelve!\" he said.He tried to sound indignant, but he didn\\'t quite manage it.  Heknew as well as I did that our valuation was crazy.Yahoo was a special case.  It was not just our price to earningsratio that was bogus.  Half our earnings were too.  Not inthe Enron way, of course.  The finance guys seemedscrupulous about reporting earnings.  What made ourearnings bogus was that Yahoo was, in effect, the center ofa Ponzi scheme.  Investors looked at Yahoo\\'s earningsand said to themselves, here is proof that Internet companies can makemoney.  So they invested in newstartups that promised to be the next Yahoo.  And as soon as these startupsgot the money, what did they do with it?Buy millions of dollars worth of advertising on Yahoo to promotetheir brand.  Result: a capital investment in a startup thisquarter shows up as Yahoo earnings next quarter—stimulatinganother round of investments in startups.As in a Ponzi scheme, what seemed to be the returns of this systemwere simply the latest round of investments in it.What made it not a Ponzi scheme was that it was unintentional.  At least, I think it was.  The venture capital business is pretty incestuous,and there were presumably people in a position, if not to createthis situation, to realize what was happening and to milk it.A year later the game was up.  Starting in January 2000, Yahoo\\'sstock price began to crash, ultimately losing 95% of itsvalue.Notice, though, that even with all the fat trimmed off its marketcap, Yahoo was still worth a lot.  Even at the morning-aftervaluations of March and April 2001, the people at Yahoo had managedto create a company worth about $8 billion in just six years.The fact is, despite all the nonsense we heardduring the Bubble about the \"new economy,\" there was acore of truth.  You needthat to get a really big bubble: you need to have somethingsolid at the center, so that even smart people are sucked in.(Isaac Newton and Jonathan Swift both lost moneyin the South Sea Bubble of 1720.)Now the pendulum has swung the other way.  Now anything thatbecame fashionable during the Bubble is ipso facto unfashionable.But that\\'s a mistake—an even bigger mistake than believingwhat everyone was saying in 1999.  Over the long term,what the Bubble got right will be more important than whatit got wrong.1. Retail VCAfter the excesses of the Bubble, it\\'s nowconsidered dubious to take companies public before they have earnings.But there is nothing intrinsically wrong withthat idea.  Taking a company public at an early stage is simplyretail VC: instead of going to venture capital firms for the last round offunding, you go to the public markets.By the end of the Bubble, companies going public with noearnings were being derided as \"concept stocks,\" as if itwere inherently stupid to invest in them.But investing in concepts isn\\'t stupid; it\\'s what VCs do,and the best of them are far from stupid.The stock of a company that doesn\\'t yet have earnings is  worthsomething.It may take a while for the market to learnhow to value such companies, just as it had to learn tovalue common stocks in the early 20th century.   But marketsare good at solving that kind of problem.  I wouldn\\'t besurprised if the market ultimately did a betterjob than VCs do now.Going public early will not be the right planfor every company.And it can of course bedisruptive—by distracting the management, or by making the earlyemployees suddenly rich.  But just as the market will learnhow to value startups, startups will learn how to minimizethe damage of going public.2. The InternetThe Internet genuinely is a big deal.  That was one reasoneven smart people were fooled by the Bubble.  Obviously it was going to have a huge effect.  Enough of an effect totriple the value of Nasdaq companies in two years?  No, as itturned out.  But it was hard to say for certain at the time. [1]The same thing happened during the Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles.What drove them was the invention of organized public finance(the South Sea Company, despite its name, was really a competitorof the Bank of England).  And that did turn out to bea big deal, in the long run.Recognizing an important trend turns out to be easier than figuring out how to profit from it.  The mistakeinvestors always seem to make is to take the trend too literally.Since the Internet was the big new thing, investors supposedthat the more Internettish the company, the better.  Hencesuch parodies as Pets.Com.In fact most of the money to be made from big trends is madeindirectly.  It was not the railroads themselves that made the most money during the railroad boom, but the companieson either side, like Carnegie\\'s steelworks, which made the rails,and Standard Oil, which used railroads to get oil to the East Coast,where it could be shipped to Europe.I think the Internet will have great effects,and that what we\\'ve seen so far is nothing compared to what\\'scoming.  But most of the winners will only indirectly beInternet companies; for every Google there will be tenJetBlues.3. ChoicesWhy will the Internet have great effects?  The general   argument is that new forms of communication always do.  They happenrarely (till industrial times there were just speech, writing, and printing),but when they do, they always cause a big splash.The specific argument, or one of them, is the Internet gives us  more choices.  In the \"old\" economy,the high cost of presenting information to people meant theyhad only a narrow range of options to choose from.  The tiny,expensive pipeline to consumers was tellingly named \"the channel.\"Control the channel and youcould feed them what you wanted, on your terms.  And itwas not just big corporations that dependedon this principle.  So, in their way, didlabor unions, the traditional news media,and the art and literary establishments.Winning depended not on doing good work, but on gaining controlof some bottleneck.There are signs that this is changing.Google has over 82 million unique users a month andannual revenues of about three billion dollars. [2]And yet have you ever seena Google ad?Something is going on here.Admittedly, Google is an extreme case.  It\\'s very easy forpeople to switch to a new search engine.  It costs littleeffort and no money to try a new one, and it\\'s easy tosee if the results are better.  And so Google doesn\\'thaveto advertise.  In a business like theirs, being the best isenough.The exciting thing about the Internet is that it\\'sshifting everything in that direction.The hard part, if you want to win by making the best stuff,is the beginning.  Eventually everyonewill learn by word of mouth that you\\'re the best,but how do you survive to that point?  And it is in this crucialstage that the Internet has the most effect.  First, theInternet lets anyone find you at almost zero cost.Second, it dramatically speeds up the rate at whichreputation spreads by word of mouth.  Together these mean that in manyfields the rule will be: Build it, and they will come.Make something great and put it online.That is a big change from the recipe for winning in thepast century.4. YouthThe aspect of the Internet Bubble that the press seemed mosttaken with was the youth of some of the startup founders.This too is a trend that will last.There is a huge standard deviation among 26 year olds.  Someare fit only for entry level jobs, but others areready to rule the world if they can find someone to handlethe paperwork for them.A 26 year old may not be very good at managing people ordealing with the SEC.  Those require experience.But those are also commodities, which can be handed off tosome lieutenant.  The most important quality in a CEO is hisvision for the company\\'s future.  What will they build next?And in that department, there are 26 year olds who cancompete with anyone.In 1970 a company president meant someone in his fifties, atleast.   If he had technologists working for him, they were treated like a racing stable: prized, but not powerful.  But as technology has grown more important, the power of nerdshas grown to reflect it.  Now it\\'s not enough for a CEO tohave someone smart he can ask about technical matters.   Increasingly,he has to be that person himself.As always, business has clung to old forms.  VCs still seemto want to install a legitimate-looking talking head as the CEO.  But increasingly the founders ofthe company are the real powers, and the grey-headed maninstalled by the VCs more like amusic group\\'s manager than a general.5. InformalityIn New York, the Bubble had dramatic consequences:suits went out of fashion.  They made one seem old.  So in1998 powerful New York types were suddenly wearingopen-necked shirts and khakis and oval wire-rimmed glasses,just like guys in Santa Clara.The pendulum has swung back a bit, driven in part by a panickedreaction by the clothing industry.  But I\\'m betting on theopen-necked shirts.  And this is not as frivolous a questionas it might seem.  Clothes are important, as all nerds can sense,though they may not realize it consciously.If you\\'re a nerd, you can understand how important clothes areby asking yourself how you\\'d feel about a companythat made you wear a suit and tie to work.  The idea soundshorrible, doesn\\'t it?  In fact, horrible far out of proportionto the mere discomfort of wearing such clothes.  A company thatmade programmers wear suits would have something deeply wrongwith it.And what would be wrong would be that how one presented oneselfcounted more than the quality of one\\'s ideas.That\\'sthe problem with formality.  Dressing up is not so much bad initself.  The problem is the receptor it binds to: dressingup is inevitably a substitutefor good ideas.   It is no coincidence that technicallyinept business types are known as \"suits.\"Nerds don\\'t just happen to dress informally.  They do it tooconsistently.  Consciously or not, they dress informally asa prophylactic measure against stupidity.6. NerdsClothing is only the most visible battleground in the waragainst formality.  Nerds tend to eschew formality of any sort.They\\'re not impressed by one\\'s job title, for example,or any of the other appurtenances of authority.Indeed, that\\'s practically the definition of a nerd.  I foundmyself talking recently to someone from Hollywood who was planninga show about nerds.  I thought it would be useful if Iexplained what a nerd was.  What I came up with was: someone whodoesn\\'t expend any effort on marketing himself.A nerd, in other words, is someone who concentrates on substance.So what\\'s the connection between nerds and technology? Roughlythat you can\\'t fool mother nature. In technical matters, youhave to get the right answers.  If your software miscalculatesthe path of a space probe, you can\\'t finesse your way out oftrouble by saying that your code is patriotic, or avant-garde,or any of the other dodges people use in nontechnicalfields.And as technology becomes increasingly important in theeconomy, nerd culture isrisingwith it.  Nerds are alreadya lot cooler than they were when I was a kid.  When I was incollege in the mid-1980s, \"nerd\" was still an insult.  Peoplewho majored in computer science generally tried to conceal it.Now women ask me where they can meet nerds.  (The answer thatsprings to mind is \"Usenix,\" but that would be like drinkingfrom a firehose.)I have no illusions about why nerd culture is becomingmore accepted.  It\\'s not because people arerealizing that substance is more important than marketing.It\\'s because the nerds are getting rich.  But that is not goingto change.7. OptionsWhat makes the nerds rich, usually, is stock options.  Now thereare moves afoot to make it harder for companies to grant   options.  To the extent there\\'s some genuine accounting abuse going on, by all means correct it.  But don\\'t kill the golden  goose.  Equity is the fuel that drives technical innovation.Options are a good idea because (a) they\\'re fair, and (b) theywork.  Someone who goes to work for a company is (one hopes)   adding to its value, and it\\'s only fair to give them a shareof it.  And as a purely practical measure, people work alotharder when they have options.  I\\'ve seen that first hand.The fact that a few crooks during the Bubble robbed theircompanies by granting themselves options doesn\\'t mean optionsare a bad idea.  During the railroad boom, some executivesenriched themselves by selling watered stock—by issuing moreshares than they said were outstanding.  But that doesn\\'t  make common stock a bad idea.  Crooks just use whatevermeans are available.If there is a problem with options, it\\'s that they rewardslightly the wrong thing.  Not surprisingly, people do what youpay them to. If you pay them by the hour, they\\'ll work a lot ofhours.  If you pay them by the volume of work done, they\\'llget a lot of work done (but only as you defined work).And if you pay them to raise thestock price, which is what options amount to, they\\'ll raisethe stock price.But that\\'s not quite what you want.  What you want is toincrease the actual value of the company, not its market cap.Over time the two inevitably meet, but not always as quicklyas options vest.  Which means options tempt employees, ifonly unconsciously, to \"pump and dump\"—to do thingsthat will make the companyseemvaluable.I found that when I was at Yahoo, I couldn\\'t help thinking,   \"how will this sound to investors?\"  when I should have beenthinking \"is this a good idea?\"So maybe the standard option deal needs to be tweaked slightly.Maybe options should be replaced with something tied moredirectly to earnings.  It\\'s still early days.8. StartupsWhat made the options valuable, for the most part, isthat they were options on the stock ofstartups.  Startups   were not of course a creation of the Bubble, but theywere more visible during the Bubble than ever before.One thing most people did learn about for the first timeduring the Bubble was the startupcreated with the intention of selling it.Originally astartup meant a small company that hoped to grow into abig one.  But increasingly startups are evolving into avehicle for developing technology on spec.As I wrote inHackers & Painters, employees seem to be mostproductive when they\\'re paid in proportion to the wealththey generate.  And the advantage of a startup—indeed,   almost its raison d\\'etre—is that it offers somethingotherwise impossible to obtain: a way ofmeasuringthat.In many businesses, it just makes more sense for companiesto get technology by buying startups rather than developing   it in house.  You pay more, but there is less risk,and risk is what big companies don\\'t want.  It makes theguys developing the technology more accountable, because theyonly get paid if they build the winner.  And you end up   with better technology, created faster, because things aremade in the innovative atmosphere of startups instead of the bureaucratic atmosphere of big companies.Our startup, Viaweb, was built to be sold.  We were openwith investors about that from the start.  And we were     careful to create something that could slot easily into alarger company.  That is the pattern for the future.9. CaliforniaThe Bubble was a California phenomenon.  When I showed upin Silicon Valley in 1998, I felt like an immigrant fromEastern Europe arriving in America in 1900.  Everyonewas so cheerful and healthy and rich.  It seemed a newand improved world.The press, ever eager to exaggerate small trends, now gives  one the impression that Silicon Valley is a ghost town.Not at all.  When I drive down 101 from the airport,I still feel a buzz of energy, as if there were a gianttransformer nearby.  Real estate is still more expensivethan just about anywhere else in the country.  The people     still look healthy, and the weather is still fabulous.The future is there.(I say \"there\" because I moved back to the East Coast afterYahoo.  I still wonder if this was a smart idea.)What makes the Bay Area superior is the attitude of thepeople.  I notice that when I come home to Boston.The first thing I see when I walk out of the airline terminalis the fat, grumpy guy incharge of the taxi line.  I brace myself for rudeness:remember, you\\'re back on the East Coast now.The atmosphere varies from city to city, and fragileorganisms like startups are exceedingly sensitive to such variation.If it hadn\\'t already been hijacked as a new euphemismfor liberal, the word to describe the atmosphere inthe Bay Area would be \"progressive.\"  People there are tryingto build the future.Boston has MIT and Harvard, but it also has a lot oftruculent, unionized employees like the police whorecently held the Democratic National Convention forransom, and a lot of people trying to be Thurston Howell.Two sides of an obsolete coin.Silicon Valley may not be the next Paris or London, but itis at least the next Chicago.  For the next fifty years,   that\\'s where new wealth will come from.10. ProductivityDuring the Bubble, optimistic analysts used to justify highprice to earnings ratios by saying that technology was going to increase productivity dramatically.  They were wrong aboutthe specific companies, but not so wrong about the underlyingprinciple.  I think one of the big trends we\\'ll see in thecoming century is a huge increase in productivity.Or more precisely, a huge increase invariationinproductivity.  Technology is a lever.  It doesn\\'t add;     it multiplies.  If the present range of productivity is  0 to 100, introducing a multiple of 10 increases the rangefrom 0 to 1000.One upshot of which is that the companies of the future maybe surprisingly small.  I sometimes daydream about how bigyou could grow a company (in revenues) without ever havingmore than ten people.  What would happen if you outsourcedeverything except product development?  If you tried this experiment,I think you\\'d be surprised at how far you could get. As Fred Brooks pointed out, small groups areintrinsically more productive, because theinternal friction in a group grows as thesquare of its size.Till quite recently, running a major companymeant managing an army of workers.  Our standards about howmany employees a company should have are still influenced byold patterns.  Startups are perforce small, because they can\\'tafford to hire a lot of people.  But I think it\\'s a big mistake forcompanies to loosen their belts as revenues increase.  Thequestion is not whether you can afford the extra salaries.   Can you afford the loss in productivity that comes from makingthe company bigger?The prospect of technological leverage will of course raise thespecter of unemployment.  I\\'m surprised people still worry aboutthis.After centuries of supposedly job-killing innovations,the number of jobs is within ten percent of the number of peoplewho want them.  This can\\'t be a coincidence.  There must be somekind of balancing mechanism.What\\'s NewWhen one looks over these trends, is there any overall theme?There does seem to be: that in the coming century, good ideaswill count for more.  That 26year olds with good ideas will increasingly have an edge over 50year olds with powerful connections.  That doing good work willmatter more than dressing up—or advertising, which is thesame thing for companies.  That peoplewill be rewarded a bit more in proportion to the value of whatthey create.If so, this is good news indeed.Good ideas always tend to win eventually.  The problem is,it can take a very long time.It took decades for relativity to be accepted, and thegreater part of a century to establish that central planning didn\\'t work.So even a small increase in therate at which good ideas win would be a momentouschange—big enough, probably, to justify a name likethe \"new economy.\"'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'A lot of cities look at Silicon Valley and ask \"How could we makesomething like that happen here?\"  Theorganicway to do it is toestablish a first-rate university in a place where rich people wantto live. That\\'s how Silicon Valley happened.  But could you shortcutthe process by funding startups?Possibly. Let\\'s consider what it would take.The first thing to understand is that encouraging startups is adifferent problem from encouraging startups in a particular city.The latter is much more expensive.People sometimes think they could improve the startup scene in theirtown by starting something likeY Combinatorthere, but in fact itwill have near zero effect.  I know because Y Combinator itself hadnear zero effect on Boston when we were based there half the year.The people we funded came from all over the country (indeed, theworld) and afterward they went wherever they could get morefunding—which generally meant Silicon Valley.The seed funding business is not a regional business, because atthat stage startups are mobile. They\\'re just a couple founders withlaptops.If you want to encourage startups in a particular city, you haveto fund startups that won\\'t leave.  There are two ways to do that:have rules preventing them from leaving, or fund them at the pointin their life when they naturally take root.  The first approachis a mistake, because it becomes a filter for selecting bad startups.If your terms force startups to do things they don\\'t want to, onlythe desperate ones will take your money.Good startups will move to another city as a condition of funding.What they won\\'t do is agree not to move the next time they needfunding.  So the only way to get them to stay is to give them enoughthat they never need to leave.___How much would that take?  If you want to keep startups from leavingyour town, you have to give them enough that they\\'re not temptedby an offer from Silicon Valley VCs that requires them to move.  Astartup would be able to refuse such an offer if they had grown tothe point where they were (a) rooted in your town and/or (b) sosuccessful that VCs would fund them even if they didn\\'t move.How much would it cost to grow a startup to that point? A minimumof several hundred thousand dollars.Wufooseem to have rootedthemselves in Tampa on $118k, but they\\'re an extreme case.  Onaverage it would take at least half a million.So if it seems too good to be true to think you could grow a localsilicon valley by giving startups $15-20k each like Y Combinator,that\\'s because it is.  To make them stick around you\\'d have to givethem at least 20 times that much.However, even that is an interesting prospect.  Suppose to be onthe safe side it would cost a million dollars per startup. If youcould get startups to stick to your town for a million apiece, thenfor a billion dollars you could bring in a thousand startups. That probably wouldn\\'t push you past Silicon Valley itself, but it might get you second place.For the price of a football stadium, any town that was decent tolive in could make itself one of the biggest startup hubs in theworld.What\\'s more, it wouldn\\'t take very long.   You could probably doit in five years.  During the term of one mayor. And it would geteasier over time, because the more startups you had in town, theless it would take to get new ones to move there. By the time youhad a thousand startups in town, the VCs wouldn\\'t be trying so hardto get them to move to Silicon Valley; instead they\\'d be openinglocal offices.  Then you\\'d really be in good shape.  You\\'d havestarted a self-sustaining chain reaction like the one that drivesthe Valley.___But now comes the hard part.  You have to pick the startups.  Howdo you do that?  Picking startups is a rare and valuable skill, andthe handful of people who have it are not readily hireable.  Andthis skill is so hard to measure that if a government did try tohire people with it, they\\'d almost certainly get the wrong ones.For example, a city could give money to a VC fund to establish alocal branch, and let them make the choices.  But only a bad VCfund would take that deal.  They wouldn\\'tseembad to the cityofficials.  They\\'d seem very impressive.  But they\\'d be bad atpicking startups.  That\\'s the characteristic failure mode of VCs.All VCs look impressive to limited partners.  The difference betweenthe good ones and the bad ones only becomes visible in the otherhalf of their jobs: choosing and advising startups.What you really want is a pool of local angel investors—peopleinvesting money they made from their own startups.  But unfortunatelyyou run into a chicken and egg problem here.  If your city isn\\'talready a startup hub, there won\\'t be people there who got richfrom startups. And there is no way I can think of that a city couldattract angels from outside. By definition they\\'re rich.  There\\'sno incentive that would make them move.However, a city could select startups by piggybacking on the expertiseof investors who weren\\'t local.  It would be pretty straightforwardto make a list of the most eminent Silicon Valley angels and fromthat to generate a list of all the startups they\\'d invested in.  Ifa city offered these companies a million dollars each to move, alot of the earlier stage ones would probably take it.Preposterous as this plan sounds, it\\'s probably the most efficientway a city could select good startups.It would hurt the startups somewhat to be separated from theiroriginal investors. On the other hand, the extra million dollarswould give them a lot more runway.___Would the transplanted startups survive?  Quite possibly. The onlyway to find out would be to try it.  It would be a pretty cheapexperiment, as civil expenditures go.  Pick 30 startups that eminentangels have recently invested in, give them each a million dollarsif they\\'ll relocate to your city, and see what happens after a year.If they seem to be thriving, you can try importing startups on alarger scale.Don\\'t be too legalistic about the conditions under which they\\'reallowed to leave.  Just have a gentlemen\\'s agreement.Don\\'t try to do it on the cheap and pick only 10 for the initialexperiment.  If you do this on too small a scale you\\'ll just guaranteefailure. Startups need to be around other startups.  30 would beenough to feel like a community.Don\\'t try to make them all work in some renovated warehouse you\\'vemade into an \"incubator.\"  Real startups prefer to work in theirown spaces.In fact, don\\'t impose any restrictions on the startups at all.Startup founders are mostlyhackers, and hackers are much moreconstrained by gentlemen\\'s agreements than regulations.  If theyshake your hand on a promise, they\\'ll keep it.  But show them alock and their first thought is how to pick it.Interestingly, the 30-startup experiment could be done by anysufficiently rich private citizen.  And what pressure it would put on the city if it worked.___Should the city take stock in return for the money?In principle they\\'re entitled to, but how would they choose valuationsfor the startups?  You couldn\\'t just give them all the same valuation:that would be too low for some (who\\'d turn you down) and too highfor others (because it might make their next round a \"down round\").And since we\\'re assuming we\\'re doing this without being able topick startups, we also have to assume we can\\'t value them, sincethat\\'s practically the same thing.Another reason not to take stock in the startups is that startupsare often involved in disreputable things.  So are establishedcompanies, but they don\\'t get blamed for it.  If someone getsmurdered by someone they met on Facebook, the press will treat thestory as if it were about Facebook.  If someone gets murdered bysomeone they met at a supermarket, the press will just treat it asa story about a murder.  So understand that if you invest in startups,they might build things that get used for pornography, or file-sharing,or the expression of unfashionable opinions.  You should probablysponsor this project jointly with your political opponents, so theycan\\'t use whatever the startups do as a club to beat you with.It would be too much of a political liability just to givethe startups the money, though.  So the best plan would be to make it convertible debt, but which didn\\'t convert except ina really big round, like $20 million.___How well this scheme worked would depend on thecity.  There aresome towns, like Portland, that would be easy to turn into startuphubs, and others, like Detroit, where it would really be an uphillbattle.  So be honest with yourself about the sort of town you havebefore you try this.It will be easier in proportion to how much your town resembles SanFrancisco.  Do you have good weather?  Do people live downtown, orhave they abandoned the center for the suburbs?  Would the city bedescribed as \"hip\" and \"tolerant,\" or as reflecting \"traditionalvalues?\"  Are there good universities nearby?  Are there walkableneighborhoods?  Would nerds feel at home?  If you answered yes toall these questions, you might be able not only to pull off thisscheme, but to do it for less than a million per startup.I realize the chance of any city havingthe political will to carry out this plan is microscopicallysmall.  I just wanted to explore what it would take if one did.How hard would it be to jumpstart a silicon valley?  It\\'sfascinating to think this prize might be withinthe reach of so many cities.  So even though they\\'ll all stillspend the money on the stadium, at least now someone can ask them:why did you choose to do that instead of becoming a seriousrival to Silicon Valley?'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': '\"Suits make a corporate comeback,\" says theNewYork Times.  Why does this sound familiar?  Maybe becausethe suit was also back inFebruary,September2004,June2004,March2004,September2003,November2002,April 2002,andFebruary2002.Why do the media keep running stories saying suits are back?  BecausePR firmstellthem to.  One of the most surprising things I discoveredduring my brief business career was the existence of the PR industry,lurking like a huge, quiet submarine beneath the news.  Of thestories you read in traditional media that aren\\'t about politics,crimes, or disasters, more than half probably come from PR firms.I know because I spent years hunting such \"press hits.\"  Our startup spentits entire marketing budget on PR: at a time when we were assemblingour own computers to save money, we were paying a PR firm $16,000a month.  And they were worth it.  PR is the news equivalent ofsearch engine optimization; instead of buying ads, which readersignore, you get yourself inserted directly into the stories.Our PR firmwas one of the best in the business.  In 18 months, they got presshits in over 60 different publications.And we weren\\'t the only ones they did great things for.  In 1997 I got a call from anotherstartup founder considering hiring them to promote his company.  Itold him they were PR gods, worth every penny of their outrageous   fees.  But I remember thinking his company\\'s name was odd.Why call an auction site \"eBay\"?SymbiosisPR is not dishonest.  Not quite.  In fact, the reason the best PRfirms are so effective is precisely that they aren\\'t dishonest.They give reporters genuinely valuable information.  A good PR firmwon\\'t bug reporters just because the client tells them to; they\\'veworked hard to build their credibility with reporters, and theydon\\'t want to destroy it by feeding them mere propaganda.If anyone is dishonest, it\\'s the reporters.  The main reason PR  firms exist is that reporters are lazy.  Or, to put it more nicely,overworked.  Really they ought to be out there digging up storiesfor themselves.  But it\\'s so tempting to sit in their offices andlet PR firms bring the stories to them.  After all, they know goodPR firms won\\'t lie to them.A good flatterer doesn\\'t lie, but tells his victim selective truths(what a nice color your eyes are). Good PR firms use the samestrategy: they give reporters stories that are true, but whose truthfavors their clients.For example, our PR firm often pitched stories about how the Web  let small merchants compete with big ones.  This was perfectly true.But the reason reporters ended up writing stories about thisparticular truth, rather than some other one, was that small merchantswere our target market, and we were paying the piper.Different publications vary greatly in their reliance on PR firms.At the bottom of the heap are the trade press, who make most oftheir money from advertising and would give the magazines away forfree if advertisers would let them.The averagetrade publication is a  bunch of ads, glued together by just enougharticles to make it look like a magazine.  They\\'re so desperate for\"content\" that some will print your press releases almost verbatim,if you take the trouble to write them to read like articles.At the other extreme are publications like theNew York Timesand theWall Street Journal.  Their reporters do go out andfind their own stories, at least some of the time.  They\\'ll listen to PR firms, but briefly and skeptically.  We managed to get press   hits in almost every publication we wanted, but we never managed to crack the print edition of theTimes.The weak point of the top reporters is not laziness, but vanity.You don\\'t pitch stories to them.  You have to approach them as ifyou were a specimen under their all-seeing microscope, and make itseem as if the story you want them to run is something they thought of themselves.Our greatest PR coup was a two-part one.  We estimated, based onsome fairly informal math, that there were about 5000 stores on theWeb.  We got one paper to print this number, which seemed neutral   enough.  But once this \"fact\" was out there in print, we could quoteit to other publications, and claim that with 1000 users we had 20%of the online store market.This was roughly true.  We really did have the biggest share of theonline store market, and 5000 was our best guess at its size.  Butthe way the story appeared in the press sounded a lot more definite.Reporters like definitive statements.  For example, many of thestories about Jeremy Jaynes\\'s conviction say that he was one of the10 worst spammers.  This \"fact\" originated in Spamhaus\\'s ROKSO list,which I think even Spamhaus would admit is a rough guess at the topspammers.  The first stories about Jaynes cited this source, butnow it\\'s simply repeated as if it were part of the indictment.All you can say with certainty about Jaynes is that he was a fairlybig spammer.  But reporters don\\'t want to print vague stuff like\"fairly big.\"  They want statements with punch, like \"top ten.\" AndPR firms give them what they want.Wearing suits, we\\'re told, will make us3.6percentmore productive.BuzzWhere the work of PR firms really does get deliberately misleading is inthe generation of \"buzz.\"  They usually feed the same story to    several different publications at once.  And when readers see similarstories in multiple places, they think there is some important trendafoot.  Which is exactly what they\\'re supposed to think.When Windows 95 was launched, people waited outside storesat midnight to buy the first copies.  None of them would have beenthere without PR firms, who generated such a buzz inthe news media that it became self-reinforcing, like a nuclear chainreaction.I doubt PR firms realize it yet, but the Web makes it possible to  track them at work.  If you search for the obvious phrases, youturn up several efforts over the years to place stories about the  return of the suit.  For example, the Reuters articlethat got picked up byUSATodayin September 2004.  \"The suit is back,\" it begins.Trend articles like this are almost always the work ofPR firms.  Once you know how to read them, it\\'s straightforward tofigure out who the client is.  With trend stories, PR firms usuallyline up one or more \"experts\" to talk about the industry generally. In this case we get three: the NPD Group, the creative director ofGQ, and a research director at Smith Barney.Whenyou get to the end of the experts, look for the client. And bingo, there it is: The Men\\'s Wearhouse.Not surprising, considering The Men\\'s Wearhouse was at that moment running ads saying \"The Suit is Back.\"  Talk about a successfulpress hit-- a wire service article whose first sentence is your ownad copy.The secret to finding other press hits from a given pitchis to realize that they all started from the same document back atthe PR firm.  Search for a few key phrases and the names of theclients and the experts, and you\\'ll turn up other variants of this story.Casualfridays are out and dress codes are inwrites Diane E. LewisinThe Boston Globe.  In a remarkable coincidence, Ms. Lewis\\'sindustry contacts also include the creative director of GQ.Ripped jeans and T-shirts are out,writes Mary Kathleen Flynn inUS News & World Report.  Andshe tooknows the creative director of GQ.Men\\'s suitsare backwrites Nicole Ford in Sexbuzz.Com (\"the ultimate men\\'sentertainment magazine\").Dressingdown loses appeal as men suit up at the officewrites TenishaMercer ofThe Detroit News.Now that so many news articles are online, I suspect you could finda similar pattern for most trend stories placed by PR firms.  Ipropose we call this new sport \"PR diving,\" and I\\'m sure there arefar more striking examples out there than this clump of five stories.OnlineAfter spending years chasing them, it\\'s now second natureto me to recognize press hits for what they are.  But before wehired a PR firm I had no idea where articles in the mainstream mediacame from.  I could tell a lot of them were crap, but I didn\\'trealize why.Remember the exercises in critical reading you did in school, whereyou had to look at a piece of writing and step back and ask whetherthe author was telling the whole truth?  If you really want to bea critical reader, it turns out you have to step back one stepfurther, and ask not just whether the author is telling the truth,butwhy he\\'s writing about this subject at all.Online, the answer tends to be a lot simpler.  Most people whopublish online write what they write for the simple reason thatthey want to.  Youcan\\'t see the fingerprints of PR firms all over the articles, asyou can in so many print publications-- which is one of the reasons,though they may not consciously realize it, that readers trustbloggers more thanBusiness Week.I was talking recently to a friend who works for abig newspaper.  He thought the print media were in serious trouble,and that they were still mostly in denial about it.  \"They thinkthe decline is cyclic,\" he said.  \"Actually it\\'s structural.\"In other words, the readers are leaving, and they\\'re not comingback.Why? I think the main reason is that the writing online is more honest.Imagine how incongruous theNew York Timesarticle aboutsuits would sound if you read it in a blog:The urge to look corporate-- sleek, commanding,  prudent, yet with just a touch of hubris on your well-cut sleeve--  is an unexpected development in a time of business disgrace.The problemwith this article is not just that it originated in a PR firm.The whole tone is bogus.  This is the tone of someone writing downto their audience.Whatever its flaws, the writing you find onlineis authentic.  It\\'s not mystery meat cooked upout of scraps of pitch letters and press releases, and pressed into molds of zippyjournalese.  It\\'s people writing what they think.I didn\\'t realize, till there was an alternative, just how artificialmost of the writing in the mainstream media was.  I\\'m not sayingI used to believe what I read inTimeandNewsweek.  Since highschool, at least, I\\'ve thought of magazines like that more asguides to what ordinary people were beingtoldto think than as  sources of information.  But I didn\\'t realize till the last  few years that writing for publication didn\\'t have to mean writingthat way.  I didn\\'t realize you could write as candidly andinformally as you would if you were writing to a friend.Readers aren\\'t the only ones who\\'ve noticed thechange.  The PR industry has too.A hilariousarticleon the site of the PR Society of America gets to the heart of the   matter:Bloggers are sensitive about becoming mouthpieces  for other organizations and companies, which is the reason they  began blogging in the first place.PR people fear bloggers for the same reason readerslike them.  And that means there may be a struggle ahead.  Asthis new kind of writing draws readers away from traditional media, weshould be prepared for whatever PR mutates into to compensate.  When I think   how hard PR firms work to score press hits in the traditional   media, I can\\'t imagine they\\'ll work any less hard to feed storiesto bloggers, if they can figure out how.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'The Hardest Lessons for Startups to Learn',\n",
       "  'date': 'April 2006',\n",
       "  'essay_text': '(This essay is derived from a talk at the 2006Startup School.)The startups we\\'ve funded so far are pretty quick, but they seemquicker to learn some lessons than others.  I think it\\'s becausesome things about startups are kind of counterintuitive.We\\'ve nowinvestedin enough companies that I\\'ve learned a trickfor determining which points are the counterintuitive ones:they\\'re the ones I have to keep repeating.So I\\'m going to number these points, and maybe with future startupsI\\'ll be able to pull off a form of Huffman coding. I\\'ll make themall read this, and then instead of nagging them in detail, I\\'lljust be able to say:number four!1. Release Early.The thing I probably repeat most is this recipe for a startup: geta version 1 out fast, then improve it based on users\\' reactions.By \"release early\" I don\\'t mean you should release something fullof bugs, but that you should release something minimal.  Users hatebugs, but they don\\'t seem to mind a minimal version 1, if there\\'smore coming soon.There are several reasons it pays to get version 1 done fast.  Oneis that this is simply the right way to write software, whether fora startup or not.  I\\'ve been repeating that since 1993, and I haven\\'t seen much since tocontradict it.  I\\'ve seen a lot of startups die because they weretoo slow to release stuff, and none because they were too quick.One of the things that will surprise you if you build somethingpopular is that you won\\'t know your users.Redditnow has almost half a millionunique visitors a month.  Who are all those people?  They have noidea.  No web startup does.  And since you don\\'t know your users,it\\'s dangerous to guess what they\\'ll like.  Better to releasesomething and let them tell you.Wufootook this to heart and releasedtheir form-builder before the underlying database.  You can\\'t evendrive the thing yet, but 83,000 people came to sit in the driver\\'sseat and hold the steering wheel.  And Wufoo got valuable feedbackfrom it: Linux users complained they used too much Flash, so theyrewrote their software not to.  If they\\'d waited to release everythingat once, they wouldn\\'t have discovered this problem till it wasmore deeply wired in.Even if you had no users, it would still be important to releasequickly, because for a startup the initial release acts as a shakedowncruise.  If anything major is broken-- if the idea\\'s no good,for example, or the founders hate one another-- the stress of gettingthat first version out will expose it.  And if you have such problemsyou want to find them early.Perhaps the most important reason to release early, though, is thatit makes you work harder.  When you\\'re working on something thatisn\\'t released, problems are intriguing.  In something that\\'s outthere, problems are alarming.  There is a lot more urgency once yourelease.  And I think that\\'s precisely why people put it off.  Theyknow they\\'ll have to work a lot harder once they do.2. Keep Pumping Out Features.Of course, \"release early\" has a second component, without whichit would be bad advice.  If you\\'re going to start with somethingthat doesn\\'t do much, you better improve it fast.What I find myself repeating is \"pump out features.\"  And this ruleisn\\'t just for the initial stages.  This is something all startupsshould do for as long as they want to be considered startups.I don\\'t mean, of course, that you should make your application evermore complex.  By \"feature\" I mean one unit of hacking-- one quantumof making users\\' lives better.As with exercise, improvements beget improvements.  If you run everyday, you\\'ll probably feel like running tomorrow.  But if you skiprunning for a couple weeks, it will be an effort to drag yourselfout.  So it is with hacking: the more ideas you implement, the moreideas you\\'ll have.  You should make your system better at least insome small way every day or two.This is not just a good way to get development done; it is also aform of marketing.  Users love a site that\\'s constantly improving.In fact, users expect a site to improve.  Imagine if you visited asite that seemed very good, and then returned two months later andnot one thing had changed.  Wouldn\\'t it start to seem lame?They\\'ll like you even better when you improve in response to theircomments, because customers are used to companies ignoring them.If you\\'re the rare exception-- a company that actually listens--you\\'ll generate fanatical loyalty.  You won\\'t need to advertise,because your users will do it for you.This seems obvious too, so why do I have to keep repeating it?  Ithink the problem here is that people get used to how things are.Once a product gets past the stage where it has glaring flaws, youstart to get used to it, and gradually whatever features it happensto have become its identity.  For example, I doubt many people atYahoo (or Google for that matter) realized how much better web mailcould be till Paul Buchheit showed them.I think the solution is to assume that anything you\\'ve made is farshort of what it could be.  Force yourself, as a sort of intellectualexercise, to keep thinking of improvements.  Ok, sure, what youhave is perfect.  But if you had to change something, what wouldit be?If your product seems finished, there are two possible explanations:(a) it is finished, or (b) you lack imagination.  Experience suggests(b) is a thousand times more likely.3. Make Users Happy.Improving constantly is an instance of a more general rule: makeusers happy.  One thing all startups have in common is that theycan\\'t force anyone to do anything.  They can\\'t force anyone to usetheir software, and they can\\'t force anyone to do deals with them.A startup has to sing for its supper.  That\\'s why the successfulones make great things.  They have to, or die.When you\\'re running a startup you feel like a little bit of debrisblown about by powerful winds.  The most powerful wind is users.They can either catch you and loft you up into the sky, as they didwith Google, or leave you flat on the pavement, as they do withmost startups.  Users are a fickle wind, but more powerful than anyother.  If they take you up, no competitor can keep you down.As a little piece of debris, the rational thing for you to do isnot to lie flat, but to curl yourself into a shape the wind willcatch.I like the wind metaphor because it reminds you how impersonal thestream of traffic is.  The vast majority of people who visit yoursite will be casual visitors.  It\\'s them you have to design yoursite for.  The people who really care will find what they want bythemselves.The median visitor will arrive with their finger poised on the Backbutton.  Think about your own experience: most links youfollow lead to something lame.  Anyone who has used the web formore than a couple weeks has beentrainedto click on Back afterfollowing a link.  So your site has to say \"Wait!  Don\\'t click onBack.  This site isn\\'t lame.  Look at this, for example.\"There are two things you have to do to make people pause.  The mostimportant is to explain, as concisely as possible, what the hellyour site is about.  How often have you visited a site that seemedto assume you already knew what they did?  For example, the corporatesitethat says thecompany makesenterprise content management solutions for business that enable  organizations to unify people, content and processes to minimize  business risk, accelerate time-to-value and sustain lower total  cost of ownership.An established company may get away with such an opaque description,but no startup can.  A startupshould be able to explain in one or two sentences exactly what itdoes.And not just to users.  You need this for everyone:investors, acquirers, partners, reporters, potential employees, andeven current employees.  You probably shouldn\\'t even start a companyto do something that can\\'t be described compellingly in one or twosentences.The other thing I repeat is to give people everything you\\'ve got,right away.  If you have something impressive, try to put it on thefront page, because that\\'s the only one most visitors will see.Though indeed there\\'s a paradox here: the more you push the goodstuff toward the front, the more likely visitors are to explorefurther.In the best case these two suggestions get combined: you tellvisitors what your site is about byshowingthem.  One of thestandard pieces of advice in fiction writing is \"show, don\\'t tell.\"Don\\'t say that a character\\'s angry; have him grind his teeth, orbreak his pencil in half.  Nothing will explain what your site doesso well as using it.The industry term here is \"conversion.\"  The job of your site isto convert casual visitors into users-- whatever your definitionof a user is.  You can measure this in your growth rate.  Eitheryour site is catching on, or it isn\\'t, and you must know which.  Ifyou have decent growth, you\\'ll win in the end, no matter how obscureyou are now.  And if you don\\'t, you need to fix something.4. Fear the Right Things.Another thing I find myself saying a lot is \"don\\'t worry.\"  Actually,it\\'s more often \"don\\'t worry about this; worry about that instead.\"Startups are right to be paranoid, but they sometimes fear the wrongthings.Most visible disasters are not so alarming as they seem.  Disastersare normal in a startup: a founder quits, you discover a patentthat covers what you\\'re doing, your servers keep crashing, you runinto an insoluble technical problem, you have to change your name,a deal falls through-- these are all par for the course.  They won\\'tkill you unless you let them.Nor will most competitors.  A lot of startups worry \"what if Googlebuilds something like us?\"  Actually big companies are not the onesyou have to worry about-- not even Google.  The people at Googleare smart, but no smarter than you; they\\'re not as motivated, becauseGoogle is not going to go out of business if this one product fails;and even at Google they have a lot of bureaucracy to slow them down.What you should fear, as a startup, is not the established players,but other startups you don\\'t know exist yet.  They\\'re way moredangerous than Google because, like you, they\\'re cornered animals.Looking just at existing competitors can give you a false sense ofsecurity.  You should compete against what someone elsecouldbedoing, not just what you can see people doing.  A corollary is thatyou shouldn\\'t relax just because you have no visible competitorsyet.  No matter what your idea, there\\'s someone else out thereworking on the same thing.That\\'s the downside of it being easier to start a startup: more peopleare doing it.  But I disagree with Caterina Fake when she says thatmakes this a bad time to start a startup.  More people are startingstartups, but not as many more as could.  Most college graduatesstill think they have to get a job.  The average person can\\'t ignoresomething that\\'s been beaten into their head since they were threejust because serving web pages recently got a lot cheaper.And in any case, competitors are not the biggest threat.  Way morestartups hose themselves than get crushed by competitors.  Thereare a lot of ways to do it, but the three main ones are internaldisputes, inertia, and ignoring users.  Each is, by itself, enoughto kill you.  But if I had to pick the worst, it would be ignoringusers.  If you want a recipe for a startup that\\'s going to die,here it is: a couple of founders who have some great idea they knoweveryone is going to love, and that\\'s what they\\'re going to build,no matter what.Almost everyone\\'s initial plan is broken.  If companies stuck totheir initial plans, Microsoft would be selling programming languages,and Apple would be selling printed circuit boards.  In both casestheir customers told them what their business should be-- and theywere smart enough to listen.As Richard Feynman said, the imagination of nature is greater thanthe imagination of man.  You\\'ll find more interesting things bylooking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking.This principle is very powerful.  It\\'s why the best abstract paintingstill falls short of Leonardo, for example.  And it applies tostartups too.  No idea for a product could ever be so clever as theones you can discover by smashing a beam of prototypes into a beamof users.5. Commitment Is a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy.I now have enough experience with startups to be able to say whatthe most important quality is in a startup founder, and it\\'s notwhat you might think.  The most important quality in a startupfounder is determination.  Not intelligence-- determination.This is a little depressing.  I\\'d like to believe Viaweb succeededbecause we were smart, not merely determined.  A lot of people inthe startup world want to believe that.  Not just founders, butinvestors too.  They like the idea of inhabiting a world ruled byintelligence.  And you can tell they really believe this, becauseit affects their investment decisions.Time after time VCs invest in startups founded by eminent professors.This may work in biotech, where a lot of startups simply commercializeexisting research, but in software you want to invest in students,not professors.  Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google were all founded bypeople who dropped out of school to do it.  What students lack inexperience they more than make up in dedication.Of course, if you want to get rich, it\\'s not enough merely to bedetermined.  You have to be smart too, right?  I\\'d like to thinkso, but I\\'ve had an experience that convinced me otherwise: I spentseveral years living in New York.You can lose quite a lot in the brains department and it won\\'t killyou.  But lose even a little bit in the commitment department, andthat will kill you very rapidly.Running a startup is like walking on your hands: it\\'s possible, butit requires extraordinary effort.  If an ordinary employee wereasked to do the things a startup founder has to, he\\'d be veryindignant.  Imagine if you were hired at some big company, and inaddition to writing software ten times faster than you\\'d ever hadto before, they expected you to answer support calls, administerthe servers, design the web site, cold-call customers, find thecompany office space, and go out and get everyone lunch.And to do all this not in the calm, womb-like atmosphere of a bigcompany, but against a backdrop of constant disasters.  That\\'s thepart that really demands determination.  In a startup, there\\'salways some disaster happening.  So if you\\'re the least bit inclinedto find an excuse to quit, there\\'s always one right there.But if you lack commitment, chances are it will have been hurtingyou long before you actually quit.  Everyone who deals with startupsknows how important commitment is, so if they sense you\\'re ambivalent,they won\\'t give you much attention.  If you lack commitment, you\\'lljust find that for some mysterious reason good things happen toyour competitors but not to you.  If you lack commitment, it willseem to you that you\\'re unlucky.Whereas if you\\'re determined to stick around, people will payattention to you, because odds are they\\'ll have to deal with youlater.  You\\'re a local, not just a tourist, so everyone has to cometo terms with you.At Y Combinator we sometimes mistakenly fund teams who have theattitude that they\\'re going to give this startup thing a shot forthree months, and if something great happens, they\\'ll stick withit-- \"something great\" meaning either that someone wants to buythem or invest millions of dollars in them.  But if this is yourattitude, \"something great\" is very unlikely to happen to you,because both acquirers and investors judge you by your level ofcommitment.If an acquirer thinks you\\'re going to stick around no matter what,they\\'ll be more likely to buy you, because if they don\\'t and youstick around, you\\'ll probably grow, your price will go up, andthey\\'ll be left wishing they\\'d bought you earlier.  Ditto forinvestors.  What really motivates investors, even big VCs, is notthe hope of good returns, but the fear of missing out.So ifyou make it clear you\\'re going to succeed no matter what, and the onlyreason you need them is to make it happen a little faster, you\\'remuch more likely to get money.You can\\'t fake this.  The only way to convince everyone that you\\'reready to fight to the death is actually to be ready to.You have to be the right kind of determined, though.  I carefullychose the word determined rather than stubborn, because stubbornnessis a disastrous quality in a startup.  You have to be determined,but flexible, like a running back.  A successful running back doesn\\'tjust put his head down and try to run through people.  He improvises:if someone appears in front of him, he runs around them; if someonetries to grab him, he spins out of their grip; he\\'ll even run inthe wrong direction briefly if that will help.  The one thing he\\'llnever do is stand still.6. There Is Always Room.I was talking recently to a startup founder about whether it mightbe good to add a social component to their software.  He said hedidn\\'t think so, because the whole social thing was tapped out.Really?  So in a hundred years the only social networking siteswill be the Facebook, MySpace, Flickr, and Del.icio.us?  Not likely.There is always room for new stuff.  At every point in history,even the darkest bits of the dark ages, people were discoveringthings that made everyone say \"why didn\\'t anyone think of thatbefore?\"  We know this continued to be true up till 2004, when theFacebook was founded-- though strictly speaking someone else didthink of that.The reason we don\\'t see the opportunities all around us is that weadjust to however things are, and assume that\\'s how things have tobe.  For example, it would seem crazy to most people to try to makea better search engine than Google.  Surely that field, at least,is tapped out.  Really?  In a hundred years-- or even twenty-- arepeople still going to search for information using something likethe current Google?  Even Google probably doesn\\'t think that.In particular, I don\\'t think there\\'s any limit to the number ofstartups.  Sometimes you hear people saying \"All these guys startingstartups now are going to be disappointed. How many little startupsare Google and Yahoo going to buy, after all?\" That sounds cleverlyskeptical, but I can prove it\\'s mistaken.  No one proposes thatthere\\'s some limit to the number of people who can be employed inan economy consisting of big, slow-moving companies with a couplethousand people each.  Why should there be any limit to the numberwho could be employed by small, fast-moving companies with ten each?It seems to me the only limit would be the number of people whowant to work that hard.The limit on the number of startups is not the number that can getacquired by Google and Yahoo-- though it seems even that shouldbe unlimited, if the startups were actually worth buying-- but theamount of wealth that can be created.  And I don\\'t think there\\'sany limit on that, except cosmological ones.So for all practical purposes, there is no limit to the number ofstartups.  Startups make wealth, which means they make things peoplewant, and if there\\'s a limit on the number of things people want,we are nowhere near it.  I still don\\'t even have a flying car.7. Don\\'t Get Your Hopes Up.This is another one I\\'ve been repeating since long before Y Combinator.It was practically the corporate motto at Viaweb.Startup founders are naturally optimistic.  They wouldn\\'t do itotherwise.  But you should treat your optimism the way you\\'d treatthe core of a nuclear reactor: as a source of power that\\'s alsovery dangerous.  You have to build a shield around it, or it willfry you.The shielding of a reactor is not uniform; the reactor would beuseless if it were.  It\\'s pierced in a few places to let pipes in.An optimism shield has to be pierced too.  I think the place todraw the line is between what you expect of yourself, and what youexpect of other people.  It\\'s ok to be optimistic about what youcan do, but assume the worst about machines and other people.This is particularly necessary in a startup, because you tend tobe pushing the limits of whatever you\\'re doing.  So things don\\'thappen in the smooth, predictable way they do in the rest of theworld.  Things change suddenly, and usually for the worse.Shielding your optimism is nowhere more important than with deals.If your startup is doing a deal, just assume it\\'s not going tohappen.  The VCs who say they\\'re going to invest in you aren\\'t.The company that says they\\'re going to buy you isn\\'t.  The bigcustomer who wants to use your system in their whole company won\\'t.Then if things work out you can be pleasantly surprised.The reason I warn startups not to get their hopes up is not to savethem from beingdisappointedwhen things fall through.  It\\'sfor a more practical reason: to prevent them from leaning theircompany against something that\\'s going to fall over, taking themwith it.For example, if someone says they want to invest in you, there\\'s anatural tendency to stop looking for other investors.  That\\'s whypeople proposing deals seem so positive: theywantyou tostop looking.  And you want to stop too, because doing deals is apain.  Raising money, in particular, is a huge time sink.  So youhave to consciously force yourself to keep looking.Even if you ultimately do the first deal, it will be to your advantageto have kept looking, because you\\'ll get better terms.  Deals aredynamic; unless you\\'re negotiating with someone unusually honest,there\\'s not a single point where you shake hands and the deal\\'sdone. There are usually a lot of subsidiary questions to be clearedup after the handshake, and if the other side senses weakness-- ifthey sense you need this deal-- they will be very tempted to screwyou in the details.VCs and corp dev guys are professional negotiators.  They\\'re trainedto take advantage of weakness.So while they\\'re often niceguys, they just can\\'t help it.  And as pros they do this more thanyou.  So don\\'t even try to bluff them.  The only way a startup canhave any leverage in a deal is genuinely not to need it.  And ifyou don\\'t believe in a deal, you\\'ll be less likely to depend on it.So I want to plant a hypnotic suggestion in your heads: when youhear someone say the words \"we want to invest in you\" or \"we wantto acquire you,\" I want the following phrase to appear automaticallyin your head:don\\'t get your hopes up.Just continue runningyour company as if this deal didn\\'t exist.  Nothing is more likelyto make it close.The way to succeed in a startup is to focus on the goal of gettinglots of users, and keep walking swiftly toward it while investorsand acquirers scurry alongside trying to wave money in your face.Speed, not MoneyThe way I\\'ve described it, starting a startup sounds pretty stressful.It is.  When I talk to the founders of the companies we\\'ve funded,they all say the same thing: I knew it would be hard, but I didn\\'trealize it would be this hard.So why do it?  It would be worth enduring a lot of pain and stressto do something grand or heroic, but just to make money?  Is makingmoney really that important?No, not really.  It seems ridiculous to me when people take businesstoo seriously.  I regard making money as a boring errand to be gotout of the way as soon as possible.  There is nothing grand orheroic about starting a startup per se.So why do I spend so much time thinking about startups?  I\\'ll tellyou why.  Economically, a startup is best seen not as a way to getrich, but as a way to work faster.  You have to make a living, anda startup is a way to get that done quickly, instead of letting itdrag on through your whole life.We take it for granted most of the time, but human life is fairlymiraculous.  It is also palpably short.  You\\'re given this marvellousthing, and then poof, it\\'s taken away.  You can see why peopleinvent gods to explain it.  But even to people who don\\'t believein gods, life commands respect.  There are times in most of ourlives when the days go by in a blur, and almost everyone has asense, when this happens, of wasting something precious.  As BenFranklin said, if you love life, don\\'t waste time, because time iswhat life is made of.So no, there\\'s nothing particularly grand about making money.  That\\'snot what makes startups worth the trouble.  What\\'s important aboutstartups is the speed.  By compressing the dull but necessary taskof making a living into the smallest possible time, you show respectfor life, and there is something grand about that.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'We may be able to improve the accuracy of Bayesian spam filtersby having them follow links to see what\\'swaiting at the other end.  Richard Jowsey ofdeath2spamnow doesthis in borderline cases, and reports that it works well.Why only do it in borderline cases?  And why only do it once?As I mentioned inWill Filters Kill Spam?,following all the urls ina spam would have an amusing side-effect.  If popular email clientsdid this in order to filter spam, the spammer\\'s serverswould take a serious pounding.  The more I think about this,the better an idea it seems.  This isn\\'t just amusing; itwould be hard to imagine a more perfectly targeted counterattackon spammers.So I\\'d like to suggest an additional feature to thoseworking on spam filters: a \"punish\" mode which,if turned on, would spider every urlin a suspected spam n times, where n could be set by the user. [1]As many people have noted, one of the problems with thecurrent email system is that it\\'s too passive.  It doeswhatever you tell it.  So far all the suggestions for fixingthe problem seem to involve new protocols.  This one  wouldn\\'t.If widely used, auto-retrieving spam filters would makethe email systemrebound.The huge volume of thespam, which has so far worked in the spammer\\'s favor,would now work against him, like a branch snapping back in   his face.   Auto-retrieving spam filters would drive thespammer\\'scostsup, and his sales down:  his bandwidth usagewould go through the roof, and his servers would grind to ahalt under the load, which would make them unavailableto the people who would have responded to the spam.Pump out a million emails an hour, get amillion hits an hour on your servers.We would want to ensure that this is only done tosuspected spams.  As a rule, any url sent to millions ofpeople is likely to be a spam url, so submitting every httprequest in every email would work fine nearly all the time.But there are a few cases where this isn\\'t true: the urlsat the bottom of mails sent from free email services likeYahoo Mail and Hotmail, for example.To protect such sites, and to prevent abuse, auto-retrievalshould be combined with blacklists of spamvertised sites.Only sites on a blacklist would get crawled, andsites would be blacklistedonly after being inspected by humans. The lifetime of a spammust be several hours at least, soit should be easy to update such a list in time tointerfere with a spam promoting a new site. [2]High-volume auto-retrieval would only be practical for userson high-bandwidthconnections, but there are enough of those to cause spammersserious trouble.   Indeed, this solution neatlymirrors the problem.  The problem with spam is that inorder to reach a few gullible people the spammer sends mail to everyone.  The non-gullible recipientsare merely collateral damage.  But the non-gullible majoritywon\\'t stop getting spam until they can stop (or threaten tostop) the gulliblefrom responding to it.  Auto-retrieving spam filters offerthem a way to do this.Would that kill spam?  Not quite.  The biggest spammerscould probably protect their servers against auto-retrieving filters.  However, the easiest and cheapest way for themto do it would be to include working unsubscribe links in   their mails.  And this would be a necessity for smaller fry,and for \"legitimate\" sites that hired spammers to promotethem.  So if auto-retrieving filters became widespread,they\\'d become auto-unsubscribing filters.In this scenario, spam would, like OS crashes, viruses, andpopups, become one of those plagues that only afflict peoplewho don\\'t bother to use the right software.'},\n",

       "  'date': 'Want to start a startup?',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.January 2006To do something well you have to like it.   That idea is not exactlynovel.  We\\'ve got it down to four words: \"Do what you love.\"  Butit\\'s not enough just to tell people that.  Doing what you love iscomplicated.The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids.  When Iwas a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition.Life had two states: some of the time adults were making you dothings, and that was called work; the rest of the time you coulddo what you wanted, and that was called playing.  Occasionally thethings adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playingwasn\\'t — for example, if you fell and hurt yourself.  But exceptfor these few anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined asnot-fun.And it did not seem to be an accident. School, it was implied, wastediousbecauseit was preparation for grownup work.The world then was divided into two groups, grownups and kids.Grownups, like some kind of cursed race, had to work.  Kids didn\\'t,but they did have to go to school, which was a dilute version ofwork meant to prepare us for the real thing.  Much as we dislikedschool, the grownups all agreed that grownup work was worse, andthat we had it easy.Teachers in particular all seemed to believe implicitly that workwas not fun.  Which is not surprising: work wasn\\'t fun for most ofthem.  Why did we have to memorize state capitals instead of playingdodgeball?  For the same reason they had to watch over a bunch ofkids instead of lying on a beach.  You couldn\\'t just do what youwanted.I\\'m not saying we should let little kids do whatever they want.They may have to be made to work on certain things.  But if we makekids work on dull stuff, it might be wise to tell them that tediousnessis not the defining quality of work, and indeed that the reasonthey have to work on dull stuff now is so they can work on moreinteresting stuff later.Once, when I was about 9 or 10, my father told me I could be whateverI wanted when I grew up, so long as I enjoyed it.  I remember thatprecisely because it seemed so anomalous.  It was like being toldto use dry water.  Whatever I thought he meant, I didn\\'t think hemeant work couldliterallybe fun — fun like playing.  Ittook me years to grasp that.JobsBy high school, the prospect of an actual job was on the horizon.Adults would sometimes come to speak to us about their work, or wewould go to see them at work.  It was always understood that theyenjoyed what they did.  In retrospect I think one may have: theprivate jet pilot.  But I don\\'t think the bank manager really did.The main reason they all acted as if they enjoyed their work waspresumably the upper-middle class convention that you\\'re supposedto.  It would not merely be bad for your career to say that youdespised your job, but a social faux-pas.Why is it conventional to pretend to like what you do?  The firstsentence of this essay explains that.  If you have to like somethingto do it well, then the most successful people will all like whatthey do.  That\\'s where the upper-middle class tradition comes from.Just as houses all over America are full ofchairsthat are, withoutthe owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of chairs designed250 years ago for French kings, conventional attitudes about workare, without the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations ofthe attitudes of people who\\'ve done great things.What a recipe for alienation.  By the time they reach an age tothink about what they\\'d like to do, most kids have been thoroughlymisled about the idea of loving one\\'s work.  School has trainedthem to regard work as an unpleasant duty.  Having a job is saidto be even more onerous than schoolwork.  And yet all the adultsclaim to like what they do.  You can\\'t blame kids for thinking \"Iam not like these people; I am not suited to this world.\"Actually they\\'ve been told three lies: the stuff they\\'ve been taughtto regard as work in school is not real work; grownup work is not(necessarily) worse than schoolwork; and many of the adults aroundthem are lying when they say they like what they do.The most dangerous liars can be the kids\\' own parents.  If you takea boring job to give your family a high standard of living, as somany people do, you risk infecting your kids with the idea thatwork is boring.Maybe it would be better for kids in this onecase if parents were not so unselfish.  A parent who set an exampleof loving their work might help their kids more than an expensivehouse.It was not till I was in college that the idea of work finally brokefree from the idea of making a living.  Then the important questionbecame not how to make money, but what to work on.  Ideally thesecoincided, but some spectacular boundary cases (like Einstein inthe patent office) proved they weren\\'t identical.The definition of work was now to make some original contributionto the world, and in the process not to starve.  But after the habitof so many years my idea of work still included a large componentof pain.  Work still seemed to require discipline, because onlyhard problems yielded grand results, and hard problems couldn\\'tliterally be fun.   Surely one had to force oneself to work on them.If you think something\\'s supposed to hurt, you\\'re less likely tonotice if you\\'re doing it wrong.  That about sums up my experienceof graduate school.BoundsHow muchare you supposed to like what you do?  Unless youknow that, you don\\'t know when to stop searching. And if, like mostpeople, you underestimate it, you\\'ll tend to stop searching tooearly.  You\\'ll end up doing something chosen for you by your parents,or the desire to make money, or prestige — or sheer inertia.Here\\'s an upper bound: Do what you love doesn\\'t mean, do what youwould like to do mostthis second.  Even Einstein probablyhad moments when he wanted to have a cup of coffee, but told himselfhe ought to finish what he was working on first.It used to perplex me when I read about people who liked what theydid so much that there was nothing they\\'d rather do.  There didn\\'tseem to be any sort of work I likedthatmuch.  If I had achoice of (a) spending the next hour working on something or (b)be teleported to Rome and spend the next hour wandering about, wasthere any sort of work I\\'d prefer?  Honestly, no.But the fact is, almost anyone would rather, at any given moment,float about in the Carribbean, or have sex, or eat some deliciousfood, than work on hard problems.  The rule about doing what youlove assumes a certain length of time.  It doesn\\'t mean, do whatwill make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiestover some longer period, like a week or a month.Unproductive pleasures pall eventually.  After a while you get tiredof lying on the beach.  If you want to stay happy, you have to dosomething.As a lower bound, you have to like your work more than any unproductivepleasure.  You have to like what you do enough that the concept of\"spare time\" seems mistaken.  Which is not to say you have to spendall your time working.  You can only work so much before you gettired and start to screw up.  Then you want to do something else— even something mindless.  But you don\\'t regard this time as theprize and the time you spend working as the pain you endure to earnit.I put the lower bound there for practical reasons.  If your workis not your favorite thing to do, you\\'ll have terrible problemswith procrastination.  You\\'ll have to force yourself to work,  andwhen you resort to that the results are distinctly inferior.To be happy I think you have to be doing something you not onlyenjoy, but admire.  You have to be able to say, at the end, wow,that\\'s pretty cool.  This doesn\\'t mean you have to make something.If you learn how to hang glide, or to speak a foreign languagefluently, that will be enough to make you say, for a while at least,wow, that\\'s pretty cool.  What there has to be is a test.So one thing that falls just short of the standard, I think, isreading books.  Except for some books in math and the hard sciences,there\\'s no test of how well you\\'ve read a book, and that\\'s whymerely reading books doesn\\'t quite feel like work.  You have to dosomething with what you\\'ve read to feel productive.I think the best test is one Gino Lee taught me: to try to do thingsthat would make your friends say wow.  But it probably wouldn\\'tstart to work properly till about age 22, because most people haven\\'thad a big enough sample to pick friends from before then.SirensWhat you should not do, I think, is worry about the opinion ofanyone beyond your friends.  You shouldn\\'t worry about prestige.Prestige is the opinion of the rest of the world.  When you can askthe opinions of people whose judgement you respect, what does itadd to consider the opinions of people you don\\'t even know?This is easy advice to give.  It\\'s hard to follow, especially whenyou\\'re young.Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warpseven your beliefs about what you enjoy.  It causes you to work noton what you like, but what you\\'d like to like.That\\'s what leads people to try to write novels, for example.  Theylike reading novels.  They notice that people who write them winNobel prizes.  What could be more wonderful, they think, than tobe a novelist?  But liking the idea of being a novelist is notenough; you have to like the actual work of novel-writing if you\\'regoing to be good at it; you have to like making up elaborate lies.Prestige is just fossilized inspiration.  If you do anything wellenough, you\\'llmakeit prestigious.  Plenty of things we nowconsider prestigious were anything but at first.  Jazz comes tomind — though almost any established art form would do.   So justdo what you like, and let prestige take care of itself.Prestige is especially dangerous to the ambitious.  If you want tomake ambitious people waste their time on errands, the way to doit is to bait the hook with prestige.  That\\'s the recipe for gettingpeople to give talks, write forewords, serve on committees, bedepartment heads, and so on.  It might be a good rule simply toavoid any prestigious task. If it didn\\'t suck, they wouldn\\'t havehad to make it prestigious.Similarly, if you admire two kinds of work equally, but one is moreprestigious, you should probably choose the other.  Your opinionsabout what\\'s admirable are always going to be slightly influencedby prestige, so if the two seem equal to you, you probably havemore genuine admiration for the less prestigious one.The other big force leading people astray is money.  Money by itselfis not that dangerous.  When something pays well but is regardedwith contempt, like telemarketing, or prostitution, or personalinjury litigation, ambitious people aren\\'t tempted by it.  Thatkind of work ends up being done by people who are \"just trying tomake a living.\"  (Tip: avoid any field whose practitioners saythis.)  The danger is when money is combined with prestige, as in,say, corporate law, or medicine.  A comparatively safe and prosperouscareer with some automatic baseline prestige is dangerously temptingto someone young, who hasn\\'t thought much about what they reallylike.The test of whether people love what they do is whether they\\'d doit even if they weren\\'t paid for it — even if they had to work atanother job to make a living.  How many corporate lawyers would dotheir current work if they had to do it for free, in their sparetime, and take day jobs as waiters to support themselves?This test is especially helpful in deciding between different kindsof academic work, because fields vary greatly in this respect.  Mostgood mathematicians would work on math even if there were no jobsas math professors, whereas in the departments at the other end ofthe spectrum, the availability of teaching jobs is the driver:people would rather be English professors than work in ad agencies,and publishing papers is the way you compete for such jobs.  Mathwould happen without math departments, but it is the existence ofEnglish majors, and therefore jobs teaching them, that calls intobeing all those thousands of dreary papers about gender and identityin the novels of Conrad.  No one doesthatkind of thing for fun.The advice of parents will tend to err on the side of money.  Itseems safe to say there are more undergrads who want to be novelistsand whose parents want them to be doctors than who want to be doctorsand whose parents want them to be novelists.  The kids think theirparents are \"materialistic.\" Not necessarily.  All parents tend tobe more conservative for their kids than they would for themselves,simply because, as parents, they share risks more than rewards.  Ifyour eight year old son decides to climb a tall tree, or your teenagedaughter decides to date the local bad boy, you won\\'t get a sharein the excitement, but if your son falls, or your daughter getspregnant, you\\'ll have to deal with the consequences.DisciplineWith such powerful forces leading us astray, it\\'s not surprisingwe find it so hard to discover what we like to work on.  Most peopleare doomed in childhood by accepting the axiom that work = pain.Those who escape this are nearly all lured onto the rocks by prestigeor money.  How many even discover something they love to work on?A few hundred thousand, perhaps, out of billions.It\\'s hard to find work you love; it must be, if so few do.  So don\\'tunderestimate this task.  And don\\'t feel bad if you haven\\'t succeededyet.  In fact, if you admit to yourself that you\\'re discontented,you\\'re a step ahead of most people, who are still in denial.  Ifyou\\'re surrounded by colleagues who claim to enjoy work that youfind contemptible, odds are they\\'re lying to themselves.  Notnecessarily, but probably.Although doing great work takes less discipline than people think — because the way to do great work is to find something you like somuch that you don\\'t have to force yourself to do it —findingwork you love does usually require discipline.   Some people arelucky enough to know what they want to do when they\\'re 12, and justglide along as if they were on railroad tracks.  But this seems theexception.  More often people who do great things have careers withthe trajectory of a ping-pong ball.  They go to school to study A,drop out and get a job doing B, and then become famous for C aftertaking it up on the side.Sometimes jumping from one sort of work to another is a sign ofenergy, and sometimes it\\'s a sign of laziness.  Are you droppingout, or boldly carving a new path?  You often can\\'t tell yourself.Plenty of people who will later do great things seem to be disappointmentsearly on, when they\\'re trying to find their niche.Is there some test you can use to keep yourself honest?  One is totry to do a good job at whatever you\\'re doing, even if you don\\'tlike it.  Then at least you\\'ll know you\\'re not using dissatisfactionas an excuse for being lazy.  Perhaps more importantly, you\\'ll getinto the habit of doing things well.Another test you can use is: always produce.  For example, if youhave a day job you don\\'t take seriously because you plan to be anovelist, are you producing?  Are you writing pages of fiction,however bad?  As long as you\\'re producing, you\\'ll know you\\'re notmerely using the hazy vision of the grand novel you plan to writeone day as an opiate.  The view of it will be obstructed by the alltoo palpably flawed one you\\'re actually writing.\"Always produce\" is also a heuristic for finding the work you love.If you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automaticallypush you away from things you think you\\'re supposed to work on,toward things you actually like.  \"Always produce\" will discoveryour life\\'s work the way water, with the aid of gravity, finds thehole in your roof.Of course, figuring out what you like to work on doesn\\'t mean youget to work on it.  That\\'s a separate question.  And if you\\'reambitious you have to keep them separate: you have to make a consciouseffort to keep your ideas about what you want from being contaminatedby what seems possible.It\\'s painful to keep them apart, because it\\'s painful to observethe gap between them. So most people pre-emptively lower theirexpectations.  For example, if you asked random people on the streetif they\\'d like to be able to draw like Leonardo, you\\'d find mostwould say something like \"Oh, I can\\'t draw.\"  This is more a statementof intention than fact; it means, I\\'m not going to try.  Becausethe fact is, if you took a random person off the street and somehowgot them to work as hard as they possibly could at drawing for thenext twenty years, they\\'d get surprisingly far.  But it would requirea great moral effort; it would mean staring failure in the eye everyday for years.  And so to protect themselves people say \"I can\\'t.\"Another related line you often hear is that not everyone can dowork they love — that someone has to do the unpleasant jobs.  Really?How do you make them?  In the US the only mechanism for forcingpeople to do unpleasant jobs is the draft, and that hasn\\'t beeninvoked for over 30 years.  All we can do is encourage people todo unpleasant work, with money and prestige.If there\\'s something people still won\\'t do, it seems as if societyjust has to make do without.  That\\'s what happened with domesticservants.  For millennia that was the canonical example of a job\"someone had to do.\"  And yet in the mid twentieth century servantspractically disappeared in rich countries, and the rich have justhad to do without.So while there may be some things someone has to do, there\\'s a goodchance anyone saying that about any particular job is mistaken.Most unpleasant jobs would either get automated or go undone if noone were willing to do them.Two RoutesThere\\'s another sense of \"not everyone can do work they love\"that\\'s all too true, however.  One has to make a living, and it\\'shard to get paid for doing work you love.  There are two routes tothat destination:The organic route: as you become more eminent, gradually to  increase the parts of your job that you like at the expense of  those you don\\'t.The two-job route: to work at things you don\\'t like to get money  to work on things you do.The organic route is more common.  It happens naturally to anyonewho does good work.  A young architect has to take whatever workhe can get, but if he does well he\\'ll gradually be in a positionto pick and choose among projects.  The disadvantage of this routeis that it\\'s slow and uncertain.  Even tenure is not real freedom.The two-job route has several variants depending on how long youwork for money at a time.  At one extreme is the \"day job,\" whereyou work regular hours at one job to make money, and work on whatyou love in your spare time.  At the other extreme you work atsomething till you makeenoughnot to have to work for money again.The two-job route is less common than the organic route, becauseit requires a deliberate choice.  It\\'s also more dangerous.  Lifetends to get more expensive as you get older, so it\\'s easy to getsucked into working longer than you expected at the money job.Worse still, anything you work on changes you.  If you work toolong on tedious stuff, it will rot your brain.  And the best payingjobs are most dangerous, because they require your full attention.The advantage of the two-job route is that it lets you jump overobstacles.  The landscape of possible jobs isn\\'t flat; there arewalls of varying heights between different kinds of work.The trick of maximizing the parts of your job that you like can get youfrom architecture to product design, but not, probably, to music.If you make money doing one thing and then work on another, youhave more freedom of choice.Which route should you take?  That depends on how sure you are ofwhat you want to do, how good you are at taking orders, how muchrisk you can stand, and the odds that anyone will pay (in yourlifetime) for what you want to do.  If you\\'re sure of the generalarea you want to work in and it\\'s something people are likely topay you for, then you should probably take the organic route.  Butif you don\\'t know what you want to work on, or don\\'t like to takeorders, you may want to take the two-job route, if you can standthe risk.Don\\'t decide too soon.  Kids who know early what they want to doseem impressive, as if they got the answer to some math questionbefore the other kids.  They have an answer, certainly, but oddsare it\\'s wrong.A friend of mine who is a quite successful doctor complains constantlyabout her job.  When people applying to medical school ask her foradvice, she wants to shake them and yell \"Don\\'t do it!\"  (But shenever does.) How did she get into this fix?  In high school shealready wanted to be a doctor.  And she is so ambitious and determinedthat she overcame every obstacle along the way — including,unfortunately, not liking it.Now she has a life chosen for her by a high-school kid.When you\\'re young, you\\'re given the impression that you\\'ll getenough information to make each choice before you need to make it.But this is certainly not so with work.  When you\\'re deciding whatto do, you have to operate on ridiculously incomplete information.Even in college you get little idea what various types of work arelike.  At best you may have a couple internships, but not all jobsoffer internships, and those that do don\\'t teach you much more aboutthe work than being a batboy teaches you about playing baseball.In the design of lives, as in the design of most other things, youget better results if you use flexible media.  So unless you\\'refairly sure what you want to do, your best bet may be to choose atype of work that could turn into either an organic or two-jobcareer.  That was probably part of the reason I chose computers.You can be a professor, or make a lot of money, or morph it intoany number of other kinds of work.It\\'s also wise, early on, to seek jobs that let you do many differentthings, so you can learn faster what various kinds of work are like.Conversely, the extreme version of the two-job route is dangerousbecause it teaches you so little about what you like.  If you workhard at being a bond trader for ten years, thinking that you\\'llquit and write novels when you have enough money, what happens whenyou quit and then discover that you don\\'t actually like writingnovels?Most people would say, I\\'d take that problem.  Give me a milliondollars and I\\'ll figure out what to do.  But it\\'s harder than itlooks.  Constraints give your life shape.  Remove them and mostpeople have no idea what to do: look at what happens to those whowin lotteries or inherit money.  Much as everyone thinks they wantfinancial security, the happiest people are not those who have it,but those who like what they do.  So a plan that promises freedomat the expense of knowing what to do with it may not be as good asit seems.Whichever route you take, expect a struggle.  Finding work you loveis very difficult.  Most people fail.  Even if you succeed, it\\'srare to be free to work on what you want till your thirties orforties.  But if you have the destination in sight you\\'ll be morelikely to arrive at it.  If you know you can love work, you\\'re inthe home stretch, and if you know what work you love, you\\'repractically there.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'A few days ago I finally figured out something I\\'ve wondered aboutfor 25 years: the relationship between wisdom and intelligence.Anyone can see they\\'re not the same by the number of people who aresmart, but not very wise.  And yet intelligence and wisdom do seemrelated.  How?What is wisdom?  I\\'d say it\\'s knowing what to do in a lot ofsituations.  I\\'m not trying to make a deep point here about thetrue nature of wisdom, just to figure out how we use the word.  Awise person is someone who usually knows the right thing to do.And yet isn\\'t being smart also knowing what to do in certainsituations?  For example, knowing what to do when the teacher tellsyour elementary school class to add all the numbers from 1 to 100?Some say wisdom and intelligence apply to different types ofproblems—wisdom to human problems and intelligence to abstractones.  But that isn\\'t true.  Some wisdom has nothing to do withpeople: for example, the wisdom of the engineer who knows certainstructures are less prone to failure than others.  And certainlysmart people can find clever solutions to human problems as wellas abstract ones.Another popular explanation is that wisdom comes from experiencewhile intelligence is innate.  But people are not simply wise inproportion to how much experience they have.  Other things mustcontribute to wisdom besides experience, and some may be innate: areflective disposition, for example.Neither of the conventional explanations of the difference betweenwisdom and intelligence stands up to scrutiny.  So what is thedifference?  If we look at how people use the words \"wise\" and\"smart,\" what they seem to mean is different shapes of performance.Curve\"Wise\" and \"smart\" are both ways of saying someone knows what todo.  The difference is that \"wise\" means one has a high averageoutcome across all situations, and \"smart\" means one does spectacularlywell in a few.  That is, if you had a graph in which the x axisrepresented situations and the y axis the outcome, the graph of thewise person would be high overall, and the graph of the smart personwould have high peaks.The distinction is similar to the rule that one should judge talentat its best and character at its worst.  Except you judge intelligenceat its best, and wisdom by its average.  That\\'s how the two arerelated: they\\'re the two different senses in which the same curvecan be high.So a wise person knows what to do in most situations, while a smartperson knows what to do in situations where few others could.  Weneed to add one more qualification: we should ignore cases wheresomeone knows what to do because they have inside information.But aside from that, I don\\'t think we can get much more specificwithout starting to be mistaken.Nor do we need to.  Simple as it is, this explanation predicts, orat least accords with, both of the conventional stories about thedistinction between wisdom and intelligence.  Human problems arethe most common type, so being good at solving those is key inachieving a high average outcome.   And it seems natural that ahigh average outcome depends mostly on experience, but that dramaticpeaks can only be achieved by people with certain rare, innatequalities; nearly anyone can learn to be a good swimmer, but to bean Olympic swimmer you need a certain body type.This explanation also suggests why wisdom is such an elusive concept:there\\'s no such thing.  \"Wise\" means something—that one ison average good at making the right choice.  But giving the name\"wisdom\" to the supposed quality that enables one to do that doesn\\'tmean such a thing exists.  To the extent \"wisdom\" means anything,it refers to a grab-bag of qualities as various as self-discipline,experience, and empathy.Likewise, though \"intelligent\" means something, we\\'re asking fortrouble if we insist on looking for a single thing called \"intelligence.\"And whatever its components, they\\'re not all innate.  We use theword \"intelligent\" as an indication of ability: a smart person cangrasp things few others could.  It does seem likely there\\'s someinborn predisposition to intelligence (and wisdom too), but thispredisposition is not itself intelligence.One reason we tend to think of intelligence as inborn is that peopletrying to measure it have concentrated on the aspects of it thatare most measurable.  A quality that\\'s inborn will obviously bemore convenient to work with than one that\\'s influenced by experience,and thus might vary in the course of a study.  The problem comeswhen we drag the word \"intelligence\" over onto what they\\'re measuring.If they\\'re measuring something inborn, they can\\'t be measuringintelligence.  Three year olds aren\\'t smart.   When we describe oneas smart, it\\'s shorthand for \"smarter than other three year olds.\"SplitPerhaps it\\'s a technicality to point out that a predisposition tointelligence is not the same as intelligence.  But it\\'s an importanttechnicality, because it reminds us that we can become smarter,just as we can become wiser.The alarming thing is that we may have to choose between the two.If wisdom and intelligence are the average and peaks of the samecurve, then they converge as the number of points on the curvedecreases.  If there\\'s just one point, they\\'re identical: the averageand maximum are the same.  But as the number of points increases,wisdom and intelligence diverge.  And historically the number ofpoints on the curve seems to have been increasing: our ability istested in an ever wider range of situations.In the time of Confucius and Socrates, people seem to have regardedwisdom, learning, and intelligence as more closely related than wedo.  Distinguishing between \"wise\" and \"smart\" is a modern habit.And the reason we do is that they\\'ve been diverging.  As knowledgegets more specialized, there are more points on the curve, and thedistinction between the spikes and the average becomes sharper,like a digital image rendered with more pixels.One consequence is that some old recipes may have become obsolete.At the very least we have to go back and figure out if they werereally recipes for wisdom or intelligence.  But the really strikingchange, as intelligence and wisdom drift apart, is that we may haveto decide which we prefer.  We may not be able to optimize for bothsimultaneously.Society seems to have voted for intelligence.  We no longer admirethe sage—not the way people did two thousand years ago.  Nowwe admire the genius.  Because in fact the distinction we beganwith has a rather brutal converse: just as you can be smart withoutbeing very wise, you can be wise without being very smart.  Thatdoesn\\'t sound especially admirable.  That gets you James Bond, whoknows what to do in a lot of situations, but has to rely on Q forthe ones involving math.Intelligence and wisdom are obviously not mutually exclusive.  Infact, a high average may help support high peaks.  But there arereasons to believe that at some point you have to choose betweenthem.  One is the example of very smart people, who are so oftenunwise that in popular culture this now seems to be regarded as therule rather than the exception.  Perhaps the absent-minded professoris wise in his way, or wiser than he seems, but he\\'s not wise inthe way Confucius or Socrates wanted people to be.NewFor both Confucius and Socrates, wisdom, virtue, and happiness werenecessarily related.  The wise man was someone who knew what theright choice was and always made it; to be the right choice, it hadto be morally right; he was therefore always happy, knowing he\\'ddone the best he could.  I can\\'t think of many ancient philosopherswho would have disagreed with that, so far as it goes.\"The superior man is always happy; the small man sad,\" said Confucius.Whereas a few years ago I read an interview with a mathematicianwho said that most nights he went to bed discontented, feeling hehadn\\'t made enough progress.The Chinese and Greek words wetranslate as \"happy\" didn\\'t mean exactly what we do by it, butthere\\'s enough overlap that this remark contradicts them.Is the mathematician a small man because he\\'s discontented?  No;he\\'s just doing a kind of work that wasn\\'t very common in Confucius\\'sday.Human knowledge seems to grow fractally.  Time after time, somethingthat seemed a small and uninteresting area—experimental error,even—turns out, when examined up close, to have as much init as all knowledge up to that point.  Several of the fractal budsthat have exploded since ancient times involve inventing anddiscovering new things.  Math, for example, used to be something ahandful of people did part-time.  Now it\\'s the career of thousands.And in work that involves making new things, some old rules don\\'tapply.Recently I\\'ve spent some time advising people, and there I find theancient rule still works: try to understand the situation as wellas you can, give the best advice you can based on your experience,and then don\\'t worry about it, knowing you did all you could.  ButI don\\'t have anything like this serenity when I\\'m writing an essay.Then I\\'m worried.  What if I run out of ideas?  And when I\\'m writing,four nights out of five I go to bed discontented, feeling I didn\\'tget enough done.Advising people and writing are fundamentally different types ofwork.  When people come to you with a problem and you have to figureout the right thing to do, you don\\'t (usually) have to inventanything.  You just weigh the alternatives and try to judge whichis the prudent choice.  Butprudencecan\\'t tell me what sentenceto write next.  The search space is too big.Someone like a judge or a military officer can in much of his workbe guided by duty, but duty is no guide in making things.  Makersdepend on something more precarious: inspiration.  And like mostpeople who lead a precarious existence, they tend to be worried,not contented.  In that respect they\\'re more like the small man ofConfucius\\'s day, always one bad harvest (or ruler) away fromstarvation. Except instead of being at the mercy of weather andofficials, they\\'re at the mercy of their own imagination.LimitsTo me it was a relief just to realize it might be ok to be discontented.The idea that a successful person should be happy has thousands ofyears of momentum behind it.  If I was any good, why didn\\'t I havethe easy confidence winners are supposed to have?  But that, I nowbelieve, is like a runner asking \"If I\\'m such a good athlete, whydo I feel so tired?\" Good runners still get tired; they just gettired at higher speeds.People whose work is to invent or discover things are in the sameposition as the runner.  There\\'s no way for them to do the bestthey can, because there\\'s no limit to what they could do.  Theclosest you can come is to compare yourself to other people.  Butthe better you do, the less this matters.  An undergrad who getssomething published feels like a star.  But for someone at the topof the field, what\\'s the test of doing well?  Runners can at leastcompare themselves to others doing exactly the same thing; if youwin an Olympic gold medal, you can be fairly content, even if youthink you could have run a bit faster.  But what is a novelist todo?Whereas if you\\'re doing the kind of work in which problems arepresented to you and you have to choose between several alternatives,there\\'s an upper bound on your performance: choosing the best everytime.  In ancient societies, nearly all work seems to have been ofthis type.  The peasant had to decide whether a garment was worthmending, and the king whether or not to invade his neighbor, butneither was expected to invent anything.  In principle they couldhave; the king could have invented firearms, then invaded hisneighbor.  But in practice innovations were so rare that they weren\\'texpected of you, any more than goalkeepers are expected to scoregoals.In practice, it seemed as if there was a correct decisionin every situation, and if you made it you\\'d done your job perfectly,just as a goalkeeper who prevents the other team from scoring isconsidered to have played a perfect game.In this world, wisdom seemed paramount.Even now, most peopledo work in which problems are put before them and they have tochoose the best alternative.  But as knowledge has grown morespecialized, there are more and more types of work in which peoplehave to make up new things, and in which performance is thereforeunbounded.  Intelligence has become increasingly important relativeto wisdom because there is more room for spikes.RecipesAnother sign we may have to choose between intelligence and wisdomis how different their recipes are.  Wisdom seems to come largelyfrom curing childish qualities, and intelligence largely fromcultivating them.Recipes for wisdom, particularly ancient ones, tend to have aremedial character.  To achieve wisdom one must cut away all thedebris that fills one\\'s head on emergence from childhood, leavingonly the important stuff.  Both self-control and experience havethis effect: to eliminate the random biases that come from your ownnature and from the circumstances of your upbringing respectively.That\\'s not all wisdom is, but it\\'s a large part of it.  Much ofwhat\\'s in the sage\\'s head is also in the head of every twelve yearold.  The difference is that in the head of the twelve year oldit\\'s mixed together with a lot of random junk.The path to intelligence seems to be through working on hard problems.You develop intelligence as you might develop muscles, throughexercise.  But there can\\'t be too much compulsion here.  No amountof discipline can replace genuine curiosity.  So cultivatingintelligence seems to be a matter of identifying some bias in one\\'scharacter—some tendency to be interested in certain types ofthings—and nurturing it.  Instead of obliterating youridiosyncrasies in an effort to make yourself a neutral vessel forthe truth, you select one and try to grow it from a seedling intoa tree.The wise are all much alike in their wisdom, but very smart peopletend to be smart in distinctive ways.Most of our educational traditions aim at wisdom. So perhaps onereason schools work badly is that they\\'re trying to make intelligenceusing recipes for wisdom.  Most recipes for wisdom have an elementof subjection.  At the very least, you\\'re supposed to do what theteacher says.  The more extreme recipes aim to break down yourindividuality the way basic training does.  But that\\'s not the routeto intelligence.  Whereas wisdom comes through humility, it mayactually help, in cultivating intelligence, to have a mistakenlyhigh opinion of your abilities, because that encourages you to keepworking.  Ideally till you realize how mistaken you were.(The reason it\\'s hard to learn new skills late in life is not justthat one\\'s brain is less malleable.  Another probably even worseobstacle is that one has higher standards.)I realize we\\'re on dangerous ground here.  I\\'m not proposing theprimary goal of education should be to increase students\\' \"self-esteem.\"That just breeds laziness.  And in any case, it doesn\\'t really foolthe kids, not the smart ones.  They can tell at a young age that acontest where everyone wins is a fraud.A teacher has to walk a narrow path: you want to encourage kids tocome up with things on their own, but you can\\'t simply applaudeverything they produce.  You have to be a good audience: appreciative,but not too easily impressed.  And that\\'s a lot of work.  You haveto have a good enough grasp of kids\\' capacities at different agesto know when to be surprised.That\\'s the opposite of traditional recipes for education.  Traditionallythe student is the audience, not the teacher; the student\\'s job isnot to invent, but to absorb some prescribed body of material.  (Theuse of the term \"recitation\" for sections in some colleges is afossil of this.) The problem with these old traditions is thatthey\\'re too much influenced by recipes for wisdom.DifferentI deliberately gave this essay a provocative title; of course it\\'sworth being wise.  But I think it\\'s important to understand therelationship between intelligence and wisdom, and particularly whatseems to be the growing gap between them.  That way we can avoidapplying rules and standards to intelligence that are really meantfor wisdom.  These two senses of \"knowing what to do\" are moredifferent than most people realize.  The path to wisdom is throughdiscipline, and the path to intelligence through carefully selectedself-indulgence.  Wisdom is universal, and intelligence idiosyncratic.And while wisdom yields calmness, intelligence much of the timeleads to discontentment.That\\'s particularly worth remembering.  A physicist friend recentlytold me half his department was on Prozac.  Perhaps if we acknowledgethat some amount of frustration is inevitable in certain kindsof work, we can mitigate its effects.  Perhaps we can box it up andput it away some of the time, instead of letting it flow togetherwith everyday sadness to produce what seems an alarmingly largepool.  At the very least, we can avoid being discontented aboutbeing discontented.If you feel exhausted, it\\'s not necessarily because there\\'s somethingwrong with you.  Maybe you\\'re just running fast.'},\n",

       "  'date': 'April 2008',\n",
       "  'essay_text': '(This essay is derived from a talk at the 2008 Startup School.)About a month after we started Y Combinator we came up with thephrase that became our motto: Make something people want.  We\\'velearned a lot since then, but if I were choosing now that\\'s stillthe one I\\'d pick.Another thing we tell founders is not to worry too much about thebusiness model, at least at first.  Not because making money isunimportant, but because it\\'s so much easier than building somethinggreat.A couple weeks ago I realized that if you put those two ideastogether, you get something surprising.  Make something people want.Don\\'t worry too much about making money.  What you\\'ve got is adescription of a charity.When you get an unexpected result like this, it could either be abug or a new discovery.  Either businesses aren\\'t supposed to belike charities, and we\\'ve proven by reductio ad absurdum that oneor both of the principles we began with is false.  Or we have a newidea.I suspect it\\'s the latter, because as soon as this thought occurredto me, a whole bunch of other things fell into place.ExamplesFor example, Craigslist.  It\\'s not a charity, but they run it likeone.  And they\\'re astoundingly successful.  When you scan down thelist of most popular web sites, the number of employees at Craigslistlooks like a misprint. Their revenues aren\\'t as high as they couldbe, but most startups would be happy to trade places with them.In Patrick O\\'Brian\\'s novels, his captains always try to get upwindof their opponents.  If you\\'re upwind, you decide when and if toengage the other ship.  Craigslist is effectively upwind of enormousrevenues.  They\\'d face some challenges if they wanted to make more,but not the sort you face when you\\'re tacking upwind, trying toforce a crappy product on ambivalent users by spending ten timesas much on sales as on development.I\\'m not saying startups should aim to end up like Craigslist.They\\'re a product of unusual circumstances.  But they\\'re a goodmodel for the early phases.Google looked a lot like a charity in the beginning. They didn\\'thave ads for over a year.  At year 1, Google was indistinguishablefrom a nonprofit.  If a nonprofit or government organization hadstarted a project to index the web, Google at year 1 is the limitof what they\\'d have produced.Back when I was working on spam filters I thought it would be agood idea to have a web-based email service with good spam filtering.I wasn\\'t thinking of it as a company.  I just wanted to keep peoplefrom getting spammed.  But as I thought more about this project, Irealized it would probably have to be a company.  It would costsomething to run, and it would be a pain to fund with grants anddonations.That was a surprising realization.  Companies often claim to bebenevolent, but it was surprising to realize there were purelybenevolent projects that had to be embodied as companies to work.I didn\\'t want to start another company, so I didn\\'t do it.  But ifsomeone had, they\\'d probably be quite rich now.  There was a windowof about two years when spam was increasing rapidly but all the bigemail services had terrible filters.  If someone had launched anew, spam-free mail service, users would have flocked to it.Notice the pattern here?  From either direction we get to the samespot.  If you start from successful startups, you find they oftenbehaved like nonprofits.  And if you start from ideas for nonprofits,you find they\\'d often make good startups.PowerHow wide is this territory?  Would all good nonprofits be goodcompanies?  Possibly not.  What makes Google so valuable is thattheir users have money.  If you make people with money love you,you can probably get some of it.  But could you also base a successfulstartup on behaving like a nonprofit to people who don\\'t have money?Could you, for example, grow a successful startup out of curing anunfashionable but deadly disease like malaria?I\\'m not sure, but I suspect that if you pushed this idea, you\\'d besurprised how far it would go.  For example, people who apply to YCombinator don\\'t generally have much money, and yet we can profitby helping them, because with our help they could make money.  Maybethe situation is similar with malaria.  Maybe an organization thathelped lift its weight off a country could benefit from the resultinggrowth.I\\'m not proposing this is a serious idea.  I don\\'t know anythingabout malaria.  But I\\'ve been kicking ideas around long enough toknow when I come across a powerful one.One way to guess how far an idea extends is to ask yourself at whatpoint you\\'d bet against it.  The thought of betting against benevolenceis alarming in the same way as saying that something is technicallyimpossible.  You\\'re just asking to be made a fool of, because theseare such powerful forces.For example, initially I thought maybe this principle only appliedto Internet startups.  Obviously it worked for Google, but whatabout Microsoft?  Surely Microsoft isn\\'t benevolent?  But when Ithink back to the beginning, they were.  Compared to IBM they werelike Robin Hood.  When IBM introduced the PC, they thought theywere going to make money selling hardware at high prices.  But bygaining control of the PC standard, Microsoft opened up the marketto any manufacturer.  Hardware prices plummeted, and lots of peoplegot to have computers who couldn\\'t otherwise have afforded them.It\\'s the sort of thing you\\'d expect Google to do.Microsoft isn\\'t so benevolent now.  Now when one thinks of whatMicrosoft does to users, all the verbs that come to mind begin withF.And yet it doesn\\'t seem to pay.Their stock price has been flat for years.  Back when they wereRobin Hood, their stock price rose like Google\\'s.  Could there bea connection?You can see how there would be.  When you\\'re small, you can\\'t bullycustomers, so you have to charm them.  Whereas when you\\'re big youcan maltreat them at will, and you tend to, because it\\'s easierthan satisfying them.  You grow big by being nice, but you can staybig by being mean.You get away with it till the underlying conditions change, andthen all your victims escape.  So \"Don\\'t be evil\" may be the mostvaluable thing Paul Buchheit made for Google, because it may turnout to be an elixir of corporate youth.  I\\'m sure they find itconstraining, but think how valuable it will be if it saves themfrom lapsing into the fatal laziness that afflicted Microsoft andIBM.The curious thing is, this elixir is freely available to any othercompany.  Anyone can adopt \"Don\\'t be evil.\"  The catch is thatpeople will hold you to it.  So I don\\'t think you\\'re going to seerecord labels or tobacco companies using this discovery.MoraleThere\\'s a lot of external evidence that benevolence works.  But howdoes it work?  One advantage of investing in a large number ofstartups is that you get a lot of data about how they work.  Fromwhat we\\'ve seen, being good seems to help startups in three ways:it improves their morale, it makes other people want to help them,and above all, it helps them be decisive.Morale is tremendously important to a startup—so importantthat morale alone is almost enough to determine success.  Startupsare often described as emotional roller-coasters. One minute you\\'regoing to take over the world, and the next you\\'re doomed.  Theproblem with feeling you\\'re doomed is not just that it makes youunhappy, but that it makes youstop working.  So the downhillsof the roller-coaster are more of a self fulfilling prophecy thanthe uphills.  If feeling you\\'re going to succeed makes you workharder, that probably improves your chances of succeeding, but iffeeling you\\'re going to fail makes you stop working, that practicallyguarantees you\\'ll fail.Here\\'s where benevolence comes in.  If you feel you\\'re really helpingpeople, you\\'ll keep working even when it seems like your startupis doomed.  Most of us have some amount of natural benevolence.The mere fact that someone needs you makes you want to help them.So if you start the kind of startup where users come back each day,you\\'ve basically built yourself a giant tamagotchi.  You\\'ve madesomething you need to take care of.Blogger is a famous example of a startup that went through reallylow lows and survived.  At one point they ran out of money andeveryone left. Evan Williams came in to work the next day, and therewas no one but him.  What kept him going?  Partly that users neededhim.  He was hosting thousands of people\\'s blogs. He couldn\\'t justlet the site die.There are many advantages of launching quickly, but the most importantmay be that once you have users, the tamagotchi effect kicks in.Once you have users to take care of, you\\'re forced to figure outwhat will make them happy, and that\\'s actually very valuableinformation.The added confidence that comes from trying to help people canalso help you with investors. One of the founders ofChatteroustold me recently that he and his cofounder had decided that this servicewas something the world needed, so they were going to keep workingon it no matter what, even if they had to move back to Canada and livein their parents\\' basements.Once they realized this, they stopped caring so much what investors thoughtabout them.  They still met with them, but they weren\\'t going todie if they didn\\'t get their money.  And you know what?  The investorsgot a lot more interested.  They could sense that the Chatterouseswere going to do this startup with or without them.If you\\'re really committed and your startup is cheap to run, youbecome very hard to kill.  And practically all startups, even themost successful, come close to death at some point.  So if doinggood for people gives you a sense of mission that makes you harderto kill, that alone more than compensates for whatever you lose bynot choosing a more selfish project.HelpAnother advantage of being good is that it makes other people wantto help you.  This too seems to be an inborn trait in humans.One of the startups we\\'ve funded,Octopart, is currently locked ina classic battle of good versus evil.  They\\'re a search site forindustrial components.  A lot of people need to search for components,and before Octopart there was no good way to do it.  That, it turnedout, was no coincidence.Octopart built the right way to search for components.  Users likeit and they\\'ve been growing rapidly.  And yet for most of Octopart\\'slife, the biggest distributor, Digi-Key, has been trying to forcethem take their prices off the site.  Octopart is sending themcustomers for free, and yet Digi-Key is trying to make that trafficstop.  Why?  Because their current business model depends onovercharging people who have incomplete information about prices.They don\\'t want search to work.The Octoparts are the nicest guys in the world.  They dropped outof the PhD program in physics at Berkeley to do this.  They justwanted to fix a problem they encountered in their research.  Imaginehow much time you could save the world\\'s engineers if they coulddo searches online.  So when I hear that a big, evil company istrying to stop them in order to keep search broken, it makes mereally want to help them. It makes me spend more time on the Octopartsthan I do with most of the other startups we\\'ve funded.  It justmade me spend several minutes telling you how great they are.  Why?Because they\\'re good guys and they\\'re trying to help the world.If you\\'re benevolent, people will rally around you: investors,customers, other companies, and potential employees.  In the longterm the most important may be the potential employees.  I thinkeveryone knows now thatgood hackersare much better than mediocreones.  If you can attract the best hackers to work for you, asGoogle has, you have a big advantage.  And the very best hackerstend to be idealistic.  They\\'re not desperate for a job.  They canwork wherever they want.  So most want to work on things that willmake the world better.CompassBut the most important advantage of being good is that it acts asa compass.  One of the hardest parts of doing a startup is that youhave so many choices.  There are just two or three of you, and athousand things you could do. How do you decide?Here\\'s the answer: Do whatever\\'s best for your users.  You can holdonto this like a rope in a hurricane, and it will save you ifanything can.  Follow it and it will take you through everythingyou need to do.It\\'s even the answer to questions that seem unrelated, like how toconvince investors to give you money.  If you\\'re a good salesman,you could try to just talk them into it.  But the more reliableroute is to convince them through your users: if you make somethingusers love enough to tell their friends, you grow exponentially,and that will convince any investor.Being good is a particularly useful strategy for making decisionsin complex situations because it\\'s stateless.  It\\'s like tellingthe truth.  The trouble with lying is that you have to remembereverything you\\'ve said in the past to make sure you don\\'t contradictyourself.  If you tell the truth you don\\'t have to remember anything,and that\\'s a really useful property in domains where things happenfast.For example, Y Combinator has now invested in 80 startups, 57 ofwhich are still alive.  (The rest have died or merged or beenacquired.)  When you\\'re trying to advise 57 startups, it turns outyou have to have a stateless algorithm.  You can\\'t have ulteriormotives when you have 57 things going on at once, because you can\\'tremember them.  So our rule is just to do whatever\\'s best for thefounders.  Not because we\\'re particularly benevolent, but becauseit\\'s the only algorithm that works on that scale.When you write something telling people to be good, you seem to beclaiming to be good yourself.  So I want to say explicitly that Iam not a particularly good person.  When I was a kid I was firmlyin the camp of bad.  The way adults used the word good, it seemedto be synonymous with quiet, so I grew up very suspicious of it.You know how there are some people whose names come up in conversationand everyone says \"He\\'ssucha great guy?\"  People never saythat about me.  The best I get is \"he means well.\"  I am not claimingto be good.  At best I speak good as a second language.So I\\'m not suggesting you be good in the usual sanctimonious way.I\\'m suggesting it because it works.  It will work not just as astatement of \"values,\" but as a guide to strategy,and even a design spec for software.  Don\\'t just not be evil.  Begood.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'There\\'s one kind of opinion I\\'d be very afraid to express publicly.If someone I knew to be both a domain expert and a reasonable personproposed an idea that sounded preposterous, I\\'d be very reluctantto say \"That will never work.\"Anyone who has studied the history of ideas, and especially thehistory of science, knows that\\'s how big things start. Someoneproposes an idea that sounds crazy, most people dismiss it, thenit gradually takes over the world.Most implausible-sounding ideas are in fact bad and could be safelydismissed. But not when they\\'re proposed by reasonable domainexperts. If the person proposing the idea is reasonable, then theyknow how implausible it sounds. And yet they\\'re proposing it anyway.That suggests they know something you don\\'t. And if they have deepdomain expertise, that\\'s probably the source of it.Such ideas are not merely unsafe to dismiss, but disproportionatelylikely to be interesting. When the average person proposes animplausible-sounding idea, its implausibility is evidence of theirincompetence. But when a reasonable domain expert does it, thesituation is reversed. There\\'s something like an efficient markethere: on average the ideas that seem craziest will, if correct,have the biggest effect. So if you can eliminate the theory thatthe person proposing an implausible-sounding idea is incompetent,its implausibility switches from evidence that it\\'s boring toevidence that it\\'s exciting.Such ideas are not guaranteed to work. But they don\\'t have to be.They just have to be sufficiently good bets — to have sufficientlyhigh expected value. And I think on average they do. I think if youbet on the entire set of implausible-sounding ideas proposed byreasonable domain experts, you\\'d end up net ahead.The reason is that everyone is too conservative. The word \"paradigm\"is overused, but this is a case where it\\'s warranted. Everyone istoo much in the grip of the current paradigm. Even the people whohave the new ideas undervalue them initially. Which means thatbefore they reach the stage of proposing them publicly, they\\'vealready subjected them to an excessively strict filter.The wise response to such an idea is not to make statements, butto ask questions, because there\\'s a real mystery here. Why has thissmart and reasonable person proposed an idea that seems so wrong?Are they mistaken, or are you? One of you has to be. If you\\'re theone who\\'s mistaken, that would be good to know, because it meansthere\\'s a hole in your model of the world. But even if they\\'remistaken, it should be interesting to learn why. A trap that anexpert falls into is one you have to worry about too.This all seems pretty obvious. And yet there are clearly a lot ofpeople who don\\'t share my fear of dismissing new ideas. Why do theydo it? Why risk looking like a jerk now and a fool later, insteadof just reserving judgement?One reason they do it is envy. If you propose a radical new ideaand it succeeds, your reputation (and perhaps also your wealth)will increase proportionally. Some people would be envious if thathappened, and this potential envy propagates back into a convictionthat you must be wrong.Another reason people dismiss new ideas is that it\\'s an easy wayto seem sophisticated. When a new idea first emerges, it usuallyseems pretty feeble. It\\'s a mere hatchling. Received wisdom is afull-grown eagle by comparison. So it\\'s easy to launch a devastatingattack on a new idea, and anyone who does will seem clever to thosewho don\\'t understand this asymmetry.This phenomenon is exacerbated by the difference between how thoseworking on new ideas and those attacking them are rewarded. Therewards for working on new ideas are weighted by the value of theoutcome. So it\\'s worth working on something that only has a 10%chance of succeeding if it would make things more than 10x better.Whereas the rewards for attacking new ideas are roughly constant;such attacks seem roughly equally clever regardless of the target.People will also attack new ideas when they have a vested interestin the old ones. It\\'s not surprising, for example, that some ofDarwin\\'s harshest critics were churchmen. People build whole careerson some ideas. When someone claims they\\'re false or obsolete, theyfeel threatened.The lowest form of dismissal is mere factionalism: to automaticallydismiss any idea associated with the opposing faction. The lowestform of all is to dismiss an idea because of who proposed it.But the main thing that leads reasonable people to dismiss new ideasis the same thing that holds people back from proposing them: thesheer pervasiveness of the current paradigm. It doesn\\'t just affectthe way we think; it is the Lego blocks we build thoughts out of.Popping out of the current paradigm is something only a few peoplecan do. And even they usually have to suppress their intuitions atfirst, like a pilot flying through cloud who has to trust hisinstruments over his sense of balance.Paradigms don\\'t just define our present thinking. They also vacuumup the trail of crumbs that led to them, making our standards fornew ideas impossibly high. The current paradigm seems so perfectto us, its offspring, that we imagine it must have been acceptedcompletely as soon as it was discovered — that whatever the church thoughtof the heliocentric model, astronomers must have been convinced assoon as Copernicus proposed it. Far, in fact, from it. Copernicuspublished the heliocentric model in 1532, but it wasn\\'t till themid seventeenth century that the balance of scientific opinionshifted in its favor.Few understand how feeble new ideas look when they first appear.So if you want to have new ideas yourself, one of the most valuablethings you can do is to learn what they look like when they\\'re born.Read about how new ideas happened, and try to get yourself into theheads of people at the time. How did things look to them, when thenew idea was only half-finished, and even the person who had it wasonly half-convinced it was right?But you don\\'t have to stop at history. You can observe big new ideasbeing born all around you right now. Just look for a reasonabledomain expert proposing something that sounds wrong.If you\\'re nice, as well as wise, you won\\'t merely resist attackingsuch people, but encourage them. Having new ideas is a lonelybusiness. Only those who\\'ve tried it know how lonely. These peopleneed your help. And if you help them, you\\'ll probably learn somethingin the process.'},\n",

Most people are even incapable of forming such opinions.\"— EinsteinThere has been a lot of talk about privilege lately. Although the\\rconcept is overused, there is something to it, and in particular\\rto the idea that privilege makes you blind — that you can\\'t see\\rthings that are visible to someone whose life is very different\\rfrom yours.But one of the most pervasive examples of this kind of blindness\\ris one that I haven\\'t seen mentioned explicitly. I\\'m going to call\\ritorthodox privilege: The more conventional-minded someone is, the\\rmore it seems to them that it\\'s safe for everyone to express their\\ropinions.It\\'s safe forthemto express their opinions, because the source\\rof their opinions is whatever it\\'s currently acceptable to believe.\\rSo it seems to them that it must be safe for everyone. They literally\\rcan\\'t imagine a true statement that would get you in trouble.And yet at every point in history, thereweretrue things that would\\rget you in trouble to say. \\rIs ours the first where this\\risn\\'t so? What an amazing coincidence that would be.Surely it should at least be the default assumption that our time\\ris not unique, and that there are true things you can\\'t say now,\\rjust as there have always been. You would think. But even in the\\rface of such overwhelming historical evidence, most people will go\\rwith their gut on this one.In the most extreme cases, people suffering from orthodox\\rprivilege will not only deny that there\\'s anything true that \\ryou can\\'t say, but will accuse you of heresy merely for saying there is. \\rThough if there\\'s more than one heresy current in\\ryour time, these accusations will be weirdly non-deterministic:\\ryou must either be an xist or a yist.Frustrating as it is to deal with these people, it\\'s important to\\rrealize that they\\'re in earnest. They\\'re not pretending they think\\rit\\'s impossible for an idea to be both unorthodox and true. The\\rworld really looks that way to them.Indeed, this is a uniquely tenacious form of privilege. People can\\rovercome the blindness induced by most forms of privilege by learning\\rmore about whatever they\\'re not. But they can\\'t overcome orthodox\\rprivilege just by learning more. They\\'d have to become more\\rindependent-minded. If that happens at all, it doesn\\'t happen on\\rthe time scale of one conversation.It may be possible to convince some people that orthodox privilege\\rmust exist even though they can\\'t sense it, just as one can with,\\rsay, dark matter. There may be some who could be convinced, for\\rexample, that it\\'s very unlikely that this is the first point in\\rhistory at which there\\'s nothing true you can\\'t say, even if they\\rcan\\'t imagine specific examples.But in general I don\\'t think it will work to say\\r\"check your privilege\" about this type of privilege, because those\\rin its demographic don\\'t realize they\\'re in it. It doesn\\'t seem to\\rconventional-minded people that they\\'re conventional-minded. It\\rjust seems to them that they\\'re right. Indeed, they tend to be\\rparticularly sure of it.Perhaps the solution is to appeal to politeness. If someone says\\rthey can hear a high-pitched noise that you can\\'t, it\\'s only polite\\rto take them at their word, instead of demanding evidence that\\'s\\rimpossible to produce, or simply denying that they hear anything.\\rImagine how rude that would seem.

       " {'title': 'Modeling a Wealth Tax',\n",
       "  'date': 'August 2020',\n",
       "  'essay_text': \"Some politicians are proposing to introduce wealth taxes in additionto income and capital gains taxes. Let's try modeling the effects of various levelsof wealth tax to see what they would mean in practice for a startupfounder.Suppose you start a successful startup in your twenties, and thenlive for another 60 years. How much of your stock will a wealth taxconsume?If the wealth tax applies to all your assets, it's easy tocalculate its effect. A wealth tax of 1% means you get to keep99% of your stock each year. After 60 years the proportionof stock you'll have left will be .99^60, or .547. So astraight 1% wealth tax means the government will over thecourse of your life take 45% of your stock.(Losing shares does not, obviously, mean becomingnetpoorer unless the value per share is increasing by less than the wealth tax rate.)Here's how much stock the government would take over 60years at various levels of wealth tax:wealth taxgovernment takes0.1%6%0.5%26%1.0%45%2.0%70%3.0%84%4.0%91%5.0%95%A wealth tax will usually have a threshold at which it starts.How much difference would a high threshold make? To model that,we need to make some assumptions about the initial value ofyour stock and the growth rate.Suppose your stock is initiallyworth $2 million, and the company's trajectory is as follows:the value of your stock grows 3x for 2 years, then 2x for 2 years,then 50% for 2 years, afterwhich you just get a typical public company growth rate,which we'll call 8%.Suppose the wealth tax threshold is$50 million. How much stock does the government take now?wealth taxgovernment takes0.1%5%0.5%23%1.0%41%2.0%65%3.0%79%4.0%88%5.0%93%It may at first seem surprising that such apparently small tax ratesproduce such dramatic effects. A 2% wealth tax with a $50\\xa0millionthreshold takes about two thirds of a successful founder's stock.The reason wealth taxes have such dramatic effects is that they'reapplied over and over to the same money. Income taxhappens every year, but only to that year's income. Whereas if youlive for 60 years after acquiring some asset, a wealth tax will taxthat same asset 60 times. A wealth tax compounds.NoteIn practice, eventually some of this 8% would come in the form of dividends, which are taxed as income at issue, so this model actuallyrepresents the most optimistic case for the founder.\"},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'In high school I decided I was going to study philosophy in college.I had several motives, some more honorable than others.  One of theless honorable was to shock people.  College was regarded as jobtraining where I grew up, so studying philosophy seemed an impressivelyimpractical thing to do.  Sort of like slashing holes in your clothesor putting a safety pin through your ear, which were other formsof impressive impracticality then just coming into fashion.But I had some more honest motives as well.  I thought studyingphilosophy would be a shortcut straight to wisdom.  All the peoplemajoring in other things would just end up with a bunch of domainknowledge.  I would be learning what was really what.I\\'d tried to read a few philosophy books.  Not recent ones; youwouldn\\'t find those in our high school library.  But I tried toread Plato and Aristotle.  I doubt I believed I understood them,but they sounded like they were talking about something important.I assumed I\\'d learn what in college.The summer before senior year I took some college classes.  I learneda lot in the calculus class, but I didn\\'t learn much in Philosophy101.  And yet my plan to study philosophy remained intact.  It wasmy fault I hadn\\'t learned anything.  I hadn\\'t read the books wewere assigned carefully enough.  I\\'d give Berkeley\\'sPrinciplesof Human Knowledgeanother shot in college.  Anything so admiredand so difficult to read must have something in it, if one couldonly figure out what.Twenty-six years later, I still don\\'t understand Berkeley.  I havea nice edition of his collected works.  Will I ever read it?  Seemsunlikely.The difference between then and now is that now I understand whyBerkeley is probably not worth trying to understand.  I think I seenow what went wrong with philosophy, and how we might fix it.WordsI did end up being a philosophy major for most of college.  Itdidn\\'t work out as I\\'d hoped.  I didn\\'t learn any magical truthscompared to which everything else was mere domain knowledge.  ButI do at least know now why I didn\\'t.  Philosophy doesn\\'t reallyhave a subject matter in the way math or history or most otheruniversity subjects do.  There is no core of knowledge one mustmaster.  The closest you come to that is a knowledge of what variousindividual philosophers have said about different topics over theyears.  Few were sufficiently correct that people have forgottenwho discovered what they discovered.Formal logic has some subject matter. I took several classes inlogic.  I don\\'t know if I learned anything from them.It does seem to me very important to be able to flip ideas around inone\\'s head: to see when two ideas don\\'t fully cover the space ofpossibilities, or when one idea is the same as another but with acouple things changed.  But did studying logic teach me the importanceof thinking this way, or make me any better at it?  I don\\'t know.There are things I know I learned from studying philosophy.  Themost dramatic I learned immediately, in the first semester offreshman year, in a class taught by Sydney Shoemaker.  I learnedthat I don\\'t exist.  I am (and you are) a collection of cells thatlurches around driven by various forces, and calls itselfI.  Butthere\\'s no central, indivisible thing that your identity goes with.You could conceivably lose half your brain and live.  Which meansyour brain could conceivably be split into two halves and eachtransplanted into different bodies.  Imagine waking up after suchan operation.  You have to imagine being two people.The real lesson here is that the concepts we use in everyday lifeare fuzzy, and break down if pushed too hard.  Even a concept asdear to us asI.  It took me a while to grasp this, but when Idid it was fairly sudden, like someone in the nineteenth centurygrasping evolution and realizing the story of creation they\\'d beentold as a child was all wrong.Outside of math there\\'s a limitto how far you can push words; in fact, it would not be a baddefinition of math to call it the study of terms that have precisemeanings.  Everyday words are inherently imprecise.  They work wellenough in everyday life that you don\\'t notice.  Words seem to work,just as Newtonian physics seems to.  But you can always make thembreak if you push them far enough.I would say that this has been, unfortunately for philosophy, thecentral fact of philosophy.  Most philosophical debates are notmerely afflicted by but driven by confusions over words.  Do wehave free will?  Depends what you mean by \"free.\" Do abstract ideasexist?  Depends what you mean by \"exist.\"Wittgenstein is popularly credited with the idea that most philosophicalcontroversies are due to confusions over language.  I\\'m not surehow much credit to give him.  I suspect a lot of people realizedthis, but reacted simply by not studying philosophy, rather thanbecoming philosophy professors.How did things get this way?  Can something people have spentthousands of years studying really be a waste of time?  Those areinteresting questions.  In fact, some of the most interestingquestions you can ask about philosophy.  The most valuable way toapproach the current philosophical tradition may be neither to getlost in pointless speculations like Berkeley, nor to shut them downlike Wittgenstein, but to study it as an example of reason gonewrong.HistoryWestern philosophy really begins with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.What we know of their predecessors comes from fragments and referencesin later works; their doctrines could be described as speculativecosmology that occasionally strays into analysis.  Presumably theywere driven by whatever makes people in every other society inventcosmologies.With Socrates, Plato, and particularly Aristotle, this traditionturned a corner.  There started to be a lot more analysis.  I suspectPlato and Aristotle were encouraged in this by progress in math.Mathematicians had by then shown that you could figure things outin a much more conclusive way than by making up fine sounding storiesabout them.People talk so much about abstractions now that we don\\'t realizewhat a leap it must have been when they first started to.  It waspresumably many thousands of years between when people first starteddescribing things as hot or cold and when someone asked \"what isheat?\"  No doubt it was a very gradual process.  We don\\'t know ifPlato or Aristotle were the first to ask any of the questions theydid.  But their works are the oldest we have that do this on a largescale, and there is a freshness (not to say naivete) about themthat suggests some of the questions they asked were new to them,at least.Aristotle in particular reminds me of the phenomenon that happenswhen people discover something new, and are so excited by it thatthey race through a huge percentage of the newly discovered territoryin one lifetime.  If so, that\\'s evidence of how new this kind ofthinking was.This is all to explain how Plato and Aristotle can be very impressiveand yet naive and mistaken.  It was impressive even to ask thequestions they did.  That doesn\\'t mean they always came up withgood answers.  It\\'s not considered insulting to say that ancientGreek mathematicians were naive in some respects, or at least lackedsome concepts that would have made their lives easier.  So I hopepeople will not be too offended if I propose that ancient philosopherswere similarly naive.  In particular, they don\\'t seem to have fullygrasped what I earlier called the central fact of philosophy: thatwords break if you push them too far.\"Much to the surprise of the builders of the first digital computers,\"Rod Brooks wrote, \"programs written for them usually did not work.\"Something similar happened when people first started tryingto talk about abstractions.  Much to their surprise, they didn\\'tarrive at answers they agreed upon.  In fact, they rarely seemedto arrive at answers at all.They were in effect arguing about artifacts induced by sampling attoo low a resolution.The proof of how useless some of their answers turned out to be ishow little effect they have.  No one after reading Aristotle\\'sMetaphysicsdoes anything differently as a result.Surely I\\'m not claiming that ideas have to have practical applicationsto be interesting?  No, they may not have to.  Hardy\\'s boast thatnumber theory had no use whatsoever wouldn\\'t disqualify it.  Buthe turned out to be mistaken.  In fact, it\\'s suspiciously hard tofind a field of math that truly has no practical use.  And Aristotle\\'sexplanation of the ultimate goal of philosophy in Book A of theMetaphysicsimplies that philosophy should be useful too.Theoretical KnowledgeAristotle\\'s goal was to find the most general of general principles.The examples he gives are convincing: an ordinary worker buildsthings a certain way out of habit; a master craftsman can do morebecause he grasps the underlying principles.  The trend is clear:the more general the knowledge, the more admirable it is.  But thenhe makes a mistake—possibly the most important mistake in thehistory of philosophy.  He has noticed that theoretical knowledgeis often acquired for its own sake, out of curiosity, rather thanfor any practical need.  So he proposes there are two kinds oftheoretical knowledge: some that\\'s useful in practical matters andsome that isn\\'t.  Since people interested in the latter are interestedin it for its own sake, it must be more noble.  So he sets as hisgoal in theMetaphysicsthe exploration of knowledge that has nopractical use.  Which means no alarms go off when he takes on grandbut vaguely understood questions and ends up getting lost in a seaof words.His mistake was to confuse motive and result.  Certainly, peoplewho want a deep understanding of something are often driven bycuriosity rather than any practical need.  But that doesn\\'t meanwhat they end up learning is useless.  It\\'s very valuable in practiceto have a deep understanding of what you\\'re doing; even if you\\'renever called on to solve advanced problems, you can see shortcutsin the solution of simple ones, and your knowledge won\\'t break downin edge cases, as it would if you were relying on formulas youdidn\\'t understand.  Knowledge is power.  That\\'s what makes theoreticalknowledge prestigious.  It\\'s also what causes smart people to becurious about certain things and not others; our DNA is not sodisinterested as we might think.So while ideas don\\'t have to have immediate practical applicationsto be interesting, the kinds of things we find interesting willsurprisingly often turn out to have practical applications.The reason Aristotle didn\\'t get anywhere in theMetaphysicswaspartly that he set off with contradictory aims: to explore the mostabstract ideas, guided by the assumption that they were useless.He was like an explorer looking for a territory to the north ofhim, starting with the assumption that it was located to the south.And since his work became the map used by generations of futureexplorers, he sent them off in the wrong direction as well.Perhaps worst of all, he protected them from both the criticism ofoutsiders and the promptings of their own inner compass by establishingthe principle that the most noble sort of theoretical knowledge hadto be useless.TheMetaphysicsis mostly a failed experiment.  A few ideas fromit turned out to be worth keeping; the bulk of it has had no effectat all.  TheMetaphysicsis among the least read of all famousbooks.  It\\'s not hard to understand the way Newton\\'sPrincipiais, but the way a garbled message is.Arguably it\\'s an interesting failed experiment.  But unfortunatelythat was not the conclusion Aristotle\\'s successors derived fromworks like theMetaphysics.Soon after, the western worldfell on intellectual hard times.  Instead of version 1s to besuperseded, the works of Plato and Aristotle became revered textsto be mastered and discussed.  And so things remained for a shockinglylong time.  It was not till around 1600 (in Europe, where the centerof gravity had shifted by then) that one found people confidentenough to treat Aristotle\\'s work as a catalog of mistakes.  Andeven then they rarely said so outright.If it seems surprising that the gap was so long, consider how littleprogress there was in math between Hellenistic times and theRenaissance.In the intervening years an unfortunate idea took hold:  that itwas not only acceptable to produce works like theMetaphysics,but that it was a particularly prestigious line of work, done by aclass of people called philosophers.  No one thought to go back anddebug Aristotle\\'s motivating argument.  And so instead of correctingthe problem Aristotle discovered by falling into it—that you caneasily get lost if you talk too loosely about very abstract ideas—they continued to fall into it.The SingularityCuriously, however, the works they produced continued to attractnew readers.  Traditional philosophy occupies a kind of singularityin this respect.  If you write in an unclear way about big ideas,you produce something that seems tantalizingly attractive toinexperienced but intellectually ambitious students.  Till one knowsbetter, it\\'s hard to distinguish something that\\'s hard to understandbecause the writer was unclear in his own mind from something likea mathematical proof that\\'s hard to understand because the ideasit represents are hard to understand.  To someone who hasn\\'t learnedthe difference, traditional philosophy seems extremely attractive:as hard (and therefore impressive) as math, yet broader in scope.That was what lured me in as a high school student.This singularity is even more singular in having its own defensebuilt in.  When things are hard to understand, people who suspectthey\\'re nonsense generally keep quiet.  There\\'s no way to prove atext is meaningless.  The closest you can get is to show that theofficial judges of some class of texts can\\'t distinguish them fromplacebos.And so instead of denouncing philosophy, most people who suspectedit was a waste of time just studied other things.  That alone isfairly damning evidence, considering philosophy\\'s claims.  It\\'ssupposed to be about the ultimate truths. Surely all smart peoplewould be interested in it, if it delivered on that promise.Because philosophy\\'s flaws turned away the sort of people who mighthave corrected them, they tended to be self-perpetuating.  BertrandRussell wrote in a letter in 1912:Hitherto the people attracted to philosophy have been mostly those  who loved the big generalizations, which were all wrong, so that  few people with exact minds have taken up the subject.His response was to launch Wittgenstein at it, with dramatic results.I think Wittgenstein deserves to be famous not for the discoverythat most previous philosophy was a waste of time, which judgingfrom the circumstantial evidence must have been made by every smartperson who studied a little philosophy and declined to pursue itfurther, but for how he acted in response.Instead of quietlyswitching to another field, he made a fuss, from inside.  He wasGorbachev.The field of philosophy is still shaken from the fright Wittgensteingave it.Later in life he spent a lot of time talking abouthow words worked.  Since that seems to be allowed, that\\'s what alot of philosophers do now.  Meanwhile, sensing a vacuum in themetaphysical speculation department, the people who used to doliterary criticism have been edging Kantward, under new names like\"literary theory,\" \"critical theory,\" and when they\\'re feelingambitious, plain \"theory.\"  The writing is the familiar word salad:Gender is not like some of the other grammatical modes which  express precisely a mode of conception without any reality that  corresponds to the conceptual mode, and consequently do not express  precisely something in reality by which the intellect could be  moved to conceive a thing the way it does, even where that motive  is not something in the thing as such.The singularity I\\'ve described is not going away.  There\\'s a marketfor writing that sounds impressive and can\\'t be disproven. Therewill always be both supply and demand.  So if one group abandonsthis territory, there will always be others ready to occupy it.A ProposalWe may be able to do better.  Here\\'s an intriguing possibility.Perhaps we should do what Aristotle meant to do, instead of whathe did.  The goal he announces in theMetaphysicsseems one worthpursuing: to discover the most general truths.  That sounds good.But instead of trying to discover them because they\\'re useless,let\\'s try to discover them because they\\'re useful.I propose we try again, but that we use that heretofore despisedcriterion, applicability, as a guide to keep us from wonderingoff into a swamp of abstractions.  Instead of trying to answer thequestion:What are the most general truths?let\\'s try to answer the questionOf all the useful things we can say, which are the most general?The test of utility I propose is whether we cause people who readwhat we\\'ve written to do anything differently afterward.  Knowingwe have to give definite (if implicit) advice will keep us fromstraying beyond the resolution of the words we\\'re using.The goal is the same as Aristotle\\'s; we just approach it from adifferent direction.As an example of a useful, general idea, consider that of thecontrolled experiment.  There\\'s an idea that has turned out to bewidely applicable.  Some might say it\\'s part of science, but it\\'snot part of any specific science; it\\'s literally meta-physics (inour sense of \"meta\").   The idea of evolution is another. It turnsout to have quite broad applications—for example, in geneticalgorithms and even product design.  Frankfurt\\'s distinction betweenlying and bullshitting seems a promising recent example.These seem to me what philosophy should look like: quite generalobservations that would cause someone who understood them to dosomething differently.Such observations will necessarily be about things that are impreciselydefined.  Once you start using words with precise meanings, you\\'redoing math.  So starting from utility won\\'t entirely solve theproblem I described above—it won\\'t flush out the metaphysicalsingularity.  But it should help.  It gives people with goodintentions a new roadmap into abstraction.  And they may therebyproduce things that make the writing of the people with bad intentionslook bad by comparison.One drawback of this approach is that it won\\'t produce the sort ofwriting that gets you tenure.  And not just because it\\'s not currentlythe fashion.  In order to get tenure in any field you must notarrive at conclusions that members of tenure committees can disagreewith.  In practice there are two kinds of solutions to this problem.In math and the sciences, you can prove what you\\'re saying, or atany rate adjust your conclusions so you\\'re not claiming anythingfalse (\"6 of 8 subjects had lower blood pressure after the treatment\").In the humanities you can either avoid drawing any definite conclusions(e.g. conclude that an issue is a complex one), or draw conclusionsso narrow that no one cares enough to disagree with you.The kind of philosophy I\\'m advocating won\\'t be able to take eitherof these routes.  At best you\\'ll be able to achieve the essayist\\'sstandard of proof, not the mathematician\\'s or the experimentalist\\'s.And yet you won\\'t be able to meet the usefulness test withoutimplying definite and fairly broadly applicable conclusions.  Worsestill, the usefulness test will tend to produce results that annoypeople: there\\'s no use in telling people things they already believe,and people are often upset to be told things they don\\'t.Here\\'s the exciting thing, though.  Anyone can do this.  Gettingto general plus useful by starting with useful and cranking up thegenerality may be unsuitable for junior professors trying to gettenure, but it\\'s better for everyone else, including professors whoalready have it.  This side of the mountain is a nice gradual slope.You can start by writing things that are useful but very specific,and then gradually make them more general.  Joe\\'s has good burritos.What makes a good burrito?  What makes good food?  What makesanything good?  You can take as long as you want.  You don\\'t haveto get all the way to the top of the mountain.  You don\\'t have totell anyone you\\'re doing philosophy.If it seems like a daunting task to do philosophy, here\\'s anencouraging thought.  The field is a lot younger than it seems.Though the first philosophers in the western tradition lived about2500 years ago, it would be misleading to say the field is 2500years old, because for most of that time the leading practitionersweren\\'t doing much more than writing commentaries on Plato orAristotle while watching over their shoulders for the next invadingarmy.  In the times when they weren\\'t, philosophy was hopelesslyintermingled with religion.  It didn\\'t shake itself free till acouple hundred years ago, and even then was afflicted by thestructural problems I\\'ve described above.  If I say this, some willsay it\\'s a ridiculously overbroad and uncharitable generalization,and others will say it\\'s old news, but here goes: judging from theirworks, most philosophers up to the present have been wasting theirtime.  So in a sense the field is still at the first step.That sounds a preposterous claim to make.  It won\\'t seem sopreposterous in 10,000 years.  Civilization always seems old, becauseit\\'s always the oldest it\\'s ever been.  The only way to say whethersomething is really old or not is by looking at structural evidence,and structurally philosophy is young; it\\'s still reeling from theunexpected breakdown of words.Philosophy is as young now as math was in 1500.  There is a lotmore to discover.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.May 2005(This essay is derived from a talk at the Berkeley CSUA.)The three big powers on the Internet now are Yahoo, Google, andMicrosoft.  Average age of their founders: 24.  So it is prettywell established now that grad students can start successfulcompanies.  And if grad students can do it, why not undergrads?Like everything else in technology, the cost of starting a startuphas decreased dramatically.  Now it\\'s so low that it has disappearedinto the noise. The main cost of starting a Web-basedstartup is food and rent.  Which means it doesn\\'t cost much moreto start a company than to be a total slacker.  You can probablystart a startup on ten thousand dollars of seed funding, if you\\'reprepared to live on ramen.The less it costs to start a company, the less you need the permissionof investors to do it.  So a lot of people will be able to startcompanies now who never could have before.The most interesting subset may be those in their early twenties.I\\'m not so excited about founders who have everything investorswant except intelligence, or everything except energy.  The mostpromising group to be liberated by the new, lower threshold arethose who have everything investors want except experience.Market RateI once claimed thatnerdswere unpopularin secondary school mainly because they had better things to dothan work full-time at being popular.  Some said I was just tellingpeople what they wanted to hear.  Well, I\\'m now about to do thatin a spectacular way: I think undergraduates are undervalued.Or more precisely, I think few realize the hugespread in the value of 20 year olds.  Some, it\\'s true, are not verycapable.  But others are more capable than all but a handful of 30year olds.Till now the problem has always been that it\\'s difficult to pickthem out.  Every VC in the world, if they could go back in time,would try to invest in Microsoft.  But which would have then?  Howmany would have understood that this particular 19 year old wasBill Gates?It\\'s hard to judge the young because (a) they change rapidly, (b)there is great variation between them, and (c) they\\'re individuallyinconsistent.  That last one is a big problem.  When you\\'re young,you occasionally say and do stupid things even when you\\'re smart.So if the algorithm is to filter out people who say stupid things,as many investors and employers unconsciously do, you\\'re going toget a lot of false positives.Most organizations who hire people right out of college are onlyaware of the average value of 22 year olds, which is not that high.  And so the idea for most of the twentieth century was that everyonehad to begin as a trainee in someentry-leveljob.  Organizations  realized there was a lot of variation in the incoming stream, butinstead of pursuing this thought they tended to suppress it, in thebelief that it was good for even the most promising kids to start at the bottom, so they didn\\'t get swelled heads.The most productive young people willalwaysbe undervaluedby large organizations, because the young have no performance tomeasure yet, and any error in guessing their ability will tend toward the mean.What\\'s an especially productive 22 year old to do?  One thing you   can do is go over the heads of organizations, directly to the users.Any company that hires you is, economically, acting as a proxy forthe customer.  The rate at which they value you (though they maynot consciously realize it) is an attempt to guess your value to  the user.  But there\\'s a way to appeal their judgement.  If youwant, you can opt to be valued directly by users, by starting yourown company.The market is a lot more discerning than any employer.  And it iscompletely non-discriminatory.  On the Internet, nobody knows you\\'rea dog.  And more to the point, nobody knows you\\'re 22.  All userscare about is whether your site or software gives them what theywant.  They don\\'t care if the person behind it is a high school kid.If you\\'re really productive, why not make employers pay market ratefor you?  Why go work as an ordinary employee for a bigcompany, when you could start a startup and make them buy it to getyou?When most people hear the word \"startup,\" they think of the famous ones that have gone public.  But most startups that succeed do itby getting bought.  And usually the acquirer doesn\\'t just want thetechnology, but the people who created it as well.Often big companies buy startups before they\\'re profitable.  Obviouslyin such cases they\\'re not after revenues.  What they want is the  development team and the software they\\'ve built so far.  When astartup gets bought for 2 or 3 million six months in, it\\'s reallymore of a hiring bonus than an acquisition.I think this sort of thing will happen more and more, and that it will be better for everyone.  It\\'s obviously better for the peoplewho start the startup, because they get a big chunk of money upfront.  But I think it will be better for the acquirers too.  Thecentral problem in big companies, and the main reason they\\'re so much less productive than small companies, is the difficulty ofvaluing each person\\'s work.  Buying larval startups solves that   problem for them: the acquirer doesn\\'t pay till the developers haveproven themselves.  Acquirers are protected on the downside, but   still get most of the upside.Product DevelopmentBuying startups also solves another problem afflicting big companies:they can\\'t do product development.  Big companies are good atextracting the value from existing products, but bad at creating   new ones.Why? It\\'s worth studying this phenomenon in detail, because this  is the raison d\\'etre of startups.To start with, most big companies have some kind of turf to protect,and this tends to warp their development decisions.  For example,Web-basedapplications are hot now, butwithin Microsoft there mustbe a lot of ambivalence about them, because the very idea of Web-basedsoftware threatens the desktop.  So any Web-based application that  Microsoft ends up with, will probably, like Hotmail, be something   developed outside the company.Another reason big companies are bad at developing new products isthat the kind of people who do that tend not to have much power inbig companies (unless they happen to be the CEO).  Disruptivetechnologies are developed by disruptive people.  And they eitherdon\\'t work for the big company, or have been outmaneuvered by yes-menand have comparatively little influence.Big companies also lose because they usually only build one of eachthing.  When you only have one Web browser, you can\\'t do anythingreally risky with it.  If ten different startups design ten differentWeb browsers and you take the best, you\\'ll probably get somethingbetter.The more general version of this problem is that there are too manynew ideas for companies to explore them all.  There might be 500   startups right now who think they\\'re making something Microsoftmight buy.  Even Microsoft probably couldn\\'t manage 500 developmentprojects in-house.Big companies also don\\'t pay people the right way.  People developinga new product at a big company get paid roughly the same whetherit succeeds or fails.  People at a startup expect to get rich ifthe product succeeds, and get nothing if it fails.So naturallythe people at the startup work a lot harder.The mere bigness of big companies is an obstacle.  In startups,  developers are often forced to talk directly to users, whether theywant to or not, because there is no one else to do sales and support.It\\'s painful doing sales, but you learn much more fromtrying to sell people something than reading what   they said in focus groups.And then of course, big companies are bad at product development because they\\'re bad at everything.  Everything happens slower inbig companies than small ones, and product development is somethingthat has to happen fast, because you have to go through a lot of   iterations to get something good.TrendI think the trend of big companies buying startups will onlyaccelerate.  One of the biggest remaining obstacles is pride.  Most  companies, at least unconsciously, feel they ought to be able todevelop stuff in house, and that buying startups is to some degree an admission of failure.  And so, as people generally do withadmissions of failure, they put it off for as long as possible.That makes the acquisition very expensive when it finally happens.What companies should do is go out and discover startups when they\\'reyoung, before VCs have puffed them up into something that costshundreds of millions to acquire.  Much of what VCs add, the acquirerdoesn\\'t need anyway.Why don\\'t acquirers try to predict the companies they\\'re going tohave to buy for hundreds of millions, and grab them early for a     tenth or a twentieth of that?  Because they can\\'t predict the winnersin advance?  If they\\'re only paying a twentieth as much, they onlyhave to predict a twentieth as well.  Surely they can manage that.I think companies that acquire technology will gradually learn to go after earlier stage startups.  They won\\'t necessarily buy themoutright.  The solution may be some hybrid of investment andacquisition: for example, to buy a chunk of the company and get anoption to buy the rest later.When companies buy startups, they\\'re effectively fusing recruiting and product development.  And I think that\\'s more efficient than doing the two separately, because you always get people who arereally committed to what they\\'re working on.Plus this method yields teams of developers who already work welltogether.  Any conflicts between them have been ironed out under   the very hot iron of running a startup.  By the time the acquirer  gets them, they\\'re finishing one another\\'s sentences.  That\\'s  valuable in software, because so many bugs occur at the boundaries between different people\\'s code.InvestorsThe increasing cheapness of starting a company doesn\\'t just givehackers more power relative to employers.  It also gives them more power relative to investors.The conventional wisdom among VCs is that hackers shouldn\\'t be   allowed to run their own companies.  The founders are supposed to  accept MBAs as their bosses, and themselves take on some title like  Chief Technical Officer.  There may be cases where this is a good idea.  But I think founders will increasingly be able to push backin the matter of control, because they just don\\'t need the investors\\'money as much as they used to.Startups are a comparatively new phenomenon.  Fairchild Semiconductoris considered the first VC-backed startup, and they were founded   in 1959, less than fifty years ago.  Measured on the time scale of   social change, what we have now is pre-beta.  So we shouldn\\'t assumethe way startups work now is the way they have to work.Fairchild needed a lot of money to get started.  They had to buildactual factories.  What does the first round of venture funding fora Web-based startup get spent on today?  More money can\\'t getsoftware written faster; it isn\\'t needed for facilities, becausethose can now be quite cheap; all money can really buy you is salesand marketing.  A sales force is worth something, I\\'ll admit.  Butmarketing is increasingly irrelevant.  On the Internet, anythinggenuinely good will spread by word of mouth.Investors\\' power comes from money.  When startups need less money,   investors have less power over them.  So future founders may nothave to accept new CEOs if they don\\'t want them.  The VCs will have to be dragged kicking and screaming down this road, but like manythings people have to be dragged kicking and screaming toward, itmay actually be good for them.Google is a sign of the way things are going.  As a condition offunding, their investors insisted they hire someone old and experiencedas CEO.  But from what I\\'ve heard the founders didn\\'t just give inand take whoever the VCs wanted.  They delayed for an entire year,and when they did finally take a CEO, they chose a guy with a PhD in computer science.It sounds to me as if the founders are still the most powerfulpeople in the company, and judging by Google\\'s performance, theiryouth and inexperience doesn\\'t seem to have hurt them.  Indeed, Isuspect Google has done better than they would have if the foundershad given the VCs what they wanted, when they wanted it, and let some MBA take over as soon as they got their first round of funding.I\\'m not claiming the business guys installed by VCs have no value.Certainly they have.  But they don\\'t need to become the founders\\'bosses, which is what that title CEO means.  I predict that in the future the executives installed by VCs will increasingly be COOsrather than CEOs.  The founders will run engineering directly, andthe rest of the company through the COO.The Open CageWith both employers and investors, the balance of power is slowlyshifting towards the young.  And yet they seem the last to realizeit.  Only the most ambitious undergrads even consider starting theirown company when they graduate.  Most just want to get a job.Maybe this is as it should be.  Maybe if the idea of starting a  startup is intimidating, you filter out the uncommitted.  But I    suspect the filter is set a little too high.  I think there arepeople who could, if they tried, start successful startups, and whoinstead let themselves be swept into the intake ducts of bigcompanies.Have you ever noticed that when animals are let out of cages, theydon\\'t always realize at first that the door\\'s open?  Often theyhave to be poked with a stick to get them out.  Something similar  happened with blogs.  People could have been publishing online in    1995, and yet blogging has only really taken off in the last coupleyears.  In 1995 we thought only professional writers were entitledto publish their ideas, and that anyone else who did was a crank.Now publishing online is becoming so popular that everyone wants  to do it, even print journalists.  But blogging has not taken off  recently because of any technical innovation; it just took eightyears for everyone to realize the cage was open.I think most undergrads don\\'t realize yet that the economic cage  is open.  A lot have been told by their parents that the route tosuccess is to get a good job.  This was true when their parentswere in college, but it\\'s less true now. The route to success isto build something valuable, and you don\\'t have to be working for    an existing company to do that.  Indeed, you can often do it betterif you\\'re not.When I talk to undergrads, what surprises me most about them is howconservative they are.   Not politically, of course.  I mean theydon\\'t seem to want to take risks.  This is a mistake, because theyounger you are, the more risk you can take.RiskRisk and reward are always proportionate.  For example, stocks areriskier than bonds, and over time always have greater returns.  Sowhy does anyone invest in bonds?  The catch is that phrase \"overtime.\"  Stocks will generate greater returns over thirty years, butthey might lose value from year to year.  So what you should investin depends on how soon you need the money.  If you\\'re young, you should take the riskiest investments you can find.All this talk about investing may seem very theoretical.  Mostundergrads probably have more debts than assets.  They may feelthey have nothing to invest.  But that\\'s not true: they have theirtime to invest, and the same rule about risk applies there.  Yourearly twenties are exactly the time to take insane career risks.The reason risk is always proportionate to reward is that market  forces make it so.  People will pay extra for stability.  So if youchoose stability-- by buying bonds, or by going to work for a bigcompany-- it\\'s going to cost you.Riskier career moves pay better on average, because there is lessdemand for them.  Extreme choices like starting a startup are so  frightening that most people won\\'t even try.  So you don\\'t end up   having as much competition as you might expect, considering theprizes at stake.The math is brutal.  While perhaps 9 out of 10 startups fail, the  one that succeeds will pay the founders more than 10 times whatthey would have made in an ordinary job.That\\'s the sense inwhich startups pay better \"on average.\"Remember that.  If you start a startup, you\\'ll probably fail.  Moststartups fail. It\\'s the nature of the business.  But it\\'s notnecessarily a mistake to try something that has a 90% chance offailing, if you can afford the risk.  Failing at 40, when you have a family to support, could be serious.  But if you fail at 22, so    what?  If you try to start a startup right out of college and it   tanks, you\\'ll end up at 23 broke and a lot smarter.  Which, if youthink about it, is roughly what you hope to get from a graduate  program.Even if your startup does tank, you won\\'t harm your prospects withemployers.  To make sure I asked some friends who work for bigcompanies.  I asked managers at Yahoo, Google, Amazon, Cisco andMicrosoft how they\\'d feel about two candidates, both 24, with equalability, one who\\'d tried to start a startup that tanked, and anotherwho\\'d spent the two years since college working as a developer ata big company.  Every one responded that they\\'d prefer the guy who\\'dtried to start his own company.  Zod Nazem, who\\'s in charge of       engineering at Yahoo, said:I actually put more value on the guy with the failed  startup.  And you can quote me!So there you have it.  Want to get hired by Yahoo?  Start your own company.The Man is the CustomerIf even big employers think highly of young hackers who startcompanies, why don\\'t more do it?  Why are undergrads so conservative?I think it\\'s because they\\'ve spent so much time in institutions.The first twenty years of everyone\\'s life consists of being pipedfrom one institution to another.  You probably didn\\'t have muchchoice about the secondary schools you went to.  And after highschool it was probably understood that you were supposed to go tocollege.  You may have had a few different colleges to choosebetween, but they were probably pretty similar.  So by this pointyou\\'ve been riding on a subway line for twenty years, and the nextstop seems to be a job.Actually college is where the line ends.  Superficially, going towork for a company may feel like just the next in a series of      institutions, but underneath, everything is different.  The end ofschool is the fulcrum of your life, the point where you go from   net consumer to net producer.The other big change is that now, you\\'re steering.  You can goanywhere you want. So it may be worth standing back and understandingwhat\\'s going on, instead of just doing the default thing.All through college, and probably long before that, most undergrads have been thinking about what employers want.  But what really matters is what customers want, because they\\'re the ones who giveemployers the money to pay you.So instead of thinking about what employers want, you\\'re probablybetter off thinking directly about what users want.  To the extent there\\'s any difference between the two, you can even use that toyour advantage if you start a company of your own.  For example,big companies like docile conformists.  But this is merely anartifact of their bigness, not something customers need.Grad SchoolI didn\\'t consciously realize all this when I was graduating from   college-- partly because I went straight to grad school.  Gradschool can be a pretty good deal, even if you think of one day   starting a startup.  You can start one when you\\'re done, or evenpull the ripcord part way through, like the founders of Yahoo andGoogle.Grad school makes a good launch pad for startups, because you\\'recollected together with a lot of smart people, and you have bigger chunks of time to work on your own projects than an undergrad orcorporate employee would.  As long as you have a fairly tolerantadvisor, you can take your time developing an idea before turning   it into a company.  David Filo and Jerry Yang started the Yahoo      directory in February 1994 and were getting a million hits a dayby the fall, but they didn\\'t actually drop out of grad school andstart a company till March 1995.You could also try the startup first, and if it doesn\\'t work, thengo to grad school.  When startups tank they usually do it fairlyquickly. Within a year you\\'ll know if you\\'re wasting your time.If it fails, that is.  If it succeeds, you may have to delay gradschool a little longer.  But you\\'ll have a much more enjoyable life  once there than you would on a regular grad student stipend.ExperienceAnother reason people in their early twenties don\\'t start startupsis that they feel they don\\'t have enough experience.  Most investorsfeel the same.I remember hearing a lot of that word \"experience\" when I was in  college.  What do people really mean by it?  Obviously it\\'s not theexperience itself that\\'s valuable, but something it changes in yourbrain.  What\\'s different about your brain after you have \"experience,\"and can you make that change happen faster?I now have some data on this, and I can tell you what tends to be missing when people lack experience.  I\\'ve said that everystartupneeds three things: to start with good people,to make something users want, and not to spend too much money.  It\\'sthe middle one you get wrong when you\\'re inexperienced.  There are   plenty of undergrads with enough technical skill to write goodsoftware, and undergrads are not especially prone to waste money.If they get something wrong, it\\'s usually not realizing they have   to make something peoplewant.This is not exclusively a failing of the young.  It\\'s common forstartup founders of all ages to build things no one wants.Fortunately, this flaw should be easy to fix.  If undergrads were  all bad programmers, the problem would be a lot harder.  It can take years to learn how to program.  But I don\\'t think it takes years to learn how to make things people want.  My hypothesis isthat all you have to do is smack hackers on the side of the headand tell them: Wake up.  Don\\'t sit here making up a priori theoriesabout what users need.  Go find some users and see what they need.Most successful startups not only do something very specific, but  solve a problem people already know they have.The big change that \"experience\" causes in your brain is learningthat you need to solve people\\'s problems.  Once you grasp that, youadvance quickly to the next step, which is figuring out what thoseproblems are.  And that takes some effort, because the way softwareactually gets used, especially by the people who pay the most forit, is not at all what you might expect.  For example, the stated  purpose of Powerpoint is to present ideas.  Its real role is to overcome people\\'s fear of public speaking.  It allows you to givean impressive-looking talk about nothing, and it causes the audienceto sit in a dark room looking at slides, instead of a bright one     looking at you.This kind of thing is out there for anyone to see.  The key is toknow to look for it-- to realize that having an idea for a startupis not like having an idea for a class project.  The goal in astartup is not to write a cool piece of software.  It\\'s to make something people want.  And to do that you have to look at users--forget about hacking, and just look at users.  This can be quite amental adjustment, because little if any of the software you writein school even has users.A few steps before a Rubik\\'s Cube is solved, it still looks like amess.  I think there are a lot of undergrads whose brains are in a  similar position: they\\'re only a few steps away from being able tostart successful startups, if they wanted to, but they don\\'t realizeit.  They have more than enough technical skill.  They just haven\\'trealized yet that the way to create wealth is to make what users   want, and that employers are just proxies for users in which risk  is pooled.If you\\'re young and smart, you don\\'t need either of those.  Youdon\\'t need someone else to tell you what users want, because you  can figure it out yourself.  And you don\\'t want to pool risk, becausethe younger you are, the more risk you should take.A Public Service MessageI\\'d like to conclude with a joint message from me and your parents.Don\\'t drop out of college to start a startup.  There\\'s no rush.     There will be plenty of time to start companies after you graduate.In fact, it may be just as well to go work for an existing companyfor a couple years after you graduate, to learn how companies work.And yet, when I think about it, I can\\'t imagine telling Bill Gatesat 19 that he should wait till he graduated to start a company.    He\\'d have told me to get lost.  And could I have honestly claimedthat he was harming his future-- that he was learning less by workingat ground zero of the microcomputer revolution than he would haveif he\\'d been taking classes back at Harvard?  No, probably not.And yes, while it is probably true that you\\'ll learn some valuablethings by going to work for an existing company for a couple yearsbefore starting your own, you\\'d learn a thing or two running your  own company during that time too.The advice about going to work for someone else would get an evencolder reception from the 19 year old Bill Gates.  So I\\'m supposed to finish college, then go work for another company for two years,and then I can start my own?  I have to wait till I\\'m 23?  That\\'sfour years.  That\\'s more than twenty percent of my life sofar.  Plus in four years it will be way too late to make money     writing a Basic interpreter for the Altair.And he\\'d be right.  The Apple II was launched just two years later.In fact, if Bill had finished college and gone to work for anothercompany as we\\'re suggesting, he might well have gone to work forApple.  And while that would probably have been better for all ofus, it wouldn\\'t have been better for him.So while I stand by our responsible advice to finish college andthen go work for a while before starting a startup, I have to admitit\\'s one of those things the old tell the young, but don\\'t expectthem to listen to.  We say this sort of thing mainly so we can claimwe warned you.  So don\\'t say I didn\\'t warn you.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'One advantage of being old is that you can see change happen inyour lifetime.  A lot of the change I\\'ve seen is fragmentation.  USpolitics is much more polarized than it used to be.  Culturally wehave ever less common ground. The creative class flocks to a handfulof happy cities, abandoning the rest.  And increasing economicinequality means the spread between rich and poor is growing too.I\\'d like to propose a hypothesis: that all these trends are instancesof the same phenomenon.  And moreover, that the cause is not someforce that\\'s pulling us apart, but rather the erosion of forcesthat had been pushing us together.Worse still, for those who worry about these trends, the forcesthat were pushing us together were an anomaly, a one-time combinationof circumstances that\\'s unlikely to be repeated — and indeed, thatwe would not want to repeat.The two forces were war (above all World War II), and the rise oflarge corporations.The effects of World War II were both economic and social.Economically, it decreased variation in income.  Like all modernarmed forces, America\\'s were socialist economically.  From eachaccording to his ability, to each according to his need.  More orless.  Higher ranking members of the military got more (as higherranking members of socialist societies always do), but what theygot was fixed according to their rank.  And the flattening effectwasn\\'t limited to those under arms, because the US economy wasconscripted too.  Between 1942 and 1945 all wages were set by theNational War Labor Board. Like the military, they defaulted toflatness.  And this national standardization of wages was so pervasivethat its effects could still be seen years after the war ended.Business owners weren\\'t supposed to be making money either.  FDRsaid \"not a single war millionaire\" would be permitted.  To ensurethat, any increase in a company\\'s profits over prewar levels wastaxed at 85%.  And when what was left after corporate taxes reachedindividuals, it was taxed again at a marginal rate of 93%.Socially too the war tended to decrease variation.  Over 16 millionmen and women from all sorts of different backgrounds were broughttogether in a way of life that was literally uniform.  Service ratesfor men born in the early 1920s approached 80%. And working towarda common goal, often under stress, brought them still closer together.Though strictly speaking World War II lasted less than 4 years forthe US, its effects lasted longer.  Wars make central governmentsmore powerful, and World War II was an extreme case of this.  Inthe US, as in all the other Allied countries, the federal governmentwas slow to give up the new powers it had acquired.  Indeed, insome respects the war didn\\'t end in 1945; the enemy just switchedto the Soviet Union.  In tax rates, federal power, defense spending,conscription, and nationalism, the decades after the war looked morelike wartime than prewar peacetime.And the social effectslasted too.  The kid pulled into the army from behind a mule teamin West Virginia didn\\'t simply go back to the farm afterward.Something else was waiting for him, something that looked a lotlike the army.If total war was the big political story of the 20th century, thebig economic story was the rise of a new kind of company.  And thistoo tended to produce both social and economic cohesion.The 20th century was the century of the big, national corporation.General Electric, General Foods, General Motors.  Developments infinance, communications, transportation, and manufacturing enableda new type of company whose goal was above all scale.  Version 1of this world was low-res: a Duplo world of a few giant companiesdominating each big market.The late 19th and early 20th centuries had been a time of consolidation,led especially by J. P. Morgan.  Thousands of companies run by theirfounders were merged into a couple hundred giant ones run byprofessional managers. Economies of scale ruled the day.  It seemedto people at the time that this was the final state of things.  JohnD. Rockefeller said in 1880The day of combination is here to stay. Individualism has gone,  never to return.He turned out to be mistaken, but he seemed right for the nexthundred years.The consolidation that began in the late 19th century continued formost of the 20th.  By the end of World War II, as Michael Lindwrites, \"the major sectors of the economy were either organizedas government-backed cartels or dominated by a few oligopolisticcorporations.\"For consumers this new world meant the same choices everywhere, butonly a few of them.  When I grew up there were only 2 or 3 of mostthings, and since they were all aiming at the middle of the marketthere wasn\\'t much to differentiate them.One of the most important instances of this phenomenon was in TV.Here there were 3 choices: NBC, CBS, and ABC. Plus public TV foreggheads and communists.  The programs that the 3 networks offered wereindistinguishable.  In fact, here there was a triple pressure towardthe center. If one show did try something daring, local affiliatesin conservative markets would make them stop. Plus since TVs wereexpensive, whole families watched the same shows together, so theyhad to be suitable for everyone.And not only did everyone get the same thing, they got it at thesame time.  It\\'s difficult to imagine now, but every night tens ofmillions of families would sit down together in front of their TVset watching the same show, at the same time, as their next doorneighbors.  What happens now with the Super Bowl used to happenevery night. We were literally in sync.In a way mid-century TV culture was good. The view it gave of theworld was like you\\'d find in a children\\'s book, and it probably hadsomething of the effect that (parents hope) children\\'s books havein making people behave better.  But, like children\\'s books, TV wasalso misleading.  Dangerously misleading, for adults. In hisautobiography, Robert MacNeil talks of seeing gruesome images thathad just come in from Vietnam and thinking, we can\\'t show these tofamilies while they\\'re having dinner.I know how pervasive the common culture was, because I tried to optout of it, and it was practically impossible to find alternatives.When I was 13 I realized, more from internal evidence than anyoutside source, that the ideas we were being fed on TV were crap,and I stopped watching it.But it wasn\\'t just TV.  It seemedlike everything around me was crap.  The politicians all saying thesame things, the consumer brands making almost identical productswith different labels stuck on to indicate how prestigious theywere meant to be, the balloon-frame houses with fake \"colonial\"skins, the cars with several feet of gratuitous metal on each endthat started to fall apart after a couple years, the \"red delicious\"apples that were red but onlynominallyapples. And in retrospect, itwascrap.But when I went looking for alternatives to fill this void, I foundpractically nothing.  There was no Internet then.  The only placeto look was in the chain bookstore in our local shopping mall.There I found a copy ofThe Atlantic.  I wish I could say it becamea gateway into a wider world, but in fact I found it boring andincomprehensible.  Like a kid tasting whisky for the first time andpretending to like it, I preserved that magazine as carefully asif it had been a book. I\\'m sure I still have it somewhere.  Butthough it was evidence that there was, somewhere, a world thatwasn\\'t red delicious, I didn\\'t find it till college.It wasn\\'t just as consumers that the big companies made us similar.They did as employers too.  Within companies there were powerfulforces pushing people toward a single model of how to look and act.IBM was particularly notorious for this, but they were only a littlemore extreme than other big companies.  And the models of how tolook and act varied little between companies. Meaning everyonewithin this world was expected to seem more or less the same.  Andnot just those in the corporate world, but also everyone who aspiredto it — which in the middle of the 20th century meant most peoplewho weren\\'t already in it.  For most of the 20th century, working-classpeople tried hard to look middle class.  You can see it in oldphotos.  Few adults aspired to look dangerous in 1950.But the rise of national corporations didn\\'t just compress usculturally.  It compressed us economically too, and on both ends.Along with giant national corporations, we got giant national laborunions.  And in the mid 20th century the corporations cut dealswith the unions where they paid over market price for labor.  Partlybecause the unions were monopolies.Partly because, ascomponents of oligopolies themselves, the corporations knew theycould safely pass the cost on to their customers, because theircompetitors would have to as well.  And partly because in mid-centurymost of the giant companies were still focused on finding new waysto milk economies of scale.  Just as startups rightly pay AWS apremium over the cost of running their own servers so they can focuson growth, many of the big national corporations were willing topay a premium for labor.As well as pushing incomes up from the bottom, by overpaying unions,the big companies of the 20th century also pushed incomes down atthe top, by underpaying their top management. Economist J. K.Galbraith wrote in 1967 that \"There are few corporations in whichit would be suggested that executive salaries are at a maximum.\"To some extent this was an illusion.  Much of the de facto pay ofexecutives never showed up on their income tax returns, because ittook the form of perks.  The higher the rate of income tax, themore pressure there was to pay employees upstream of it.  (In theUK, where taxes were even higher than in the US, companies wouldeven pay their kids\\' private school tuitions.)  One of the mostvaluable things the big companies of the mid 20th century gave theiremployees was job security, and this too didn\\'t show up in taxreturns or income statistics. So the nature of employment in theseorganizations tended to yield falsely low numbers about economicinequality.  But even accounting for that, the big companies paidtheir best people less than market price.  There was no market; theexpectation was that you\\'d work for the same company for decadesif not your whole career.Your work was so illiquid there was little chance of getting marketprice. But that same illiquidity also encouraged you not to seekit.  If the company promised to employ you till you retired andgive you a pension afterward, you didn\\'t want to extract as muchfrom it this year as you could. You needed to take care of thecompany so it could take care of you.  Especially when you\\'d beenworking with the same group of people for decades.  If you triedto squeeze the company for more money, you were squeezing theorganization that was going to take care ofthem.  Plus ifyou didn\\'t put the company first you wouldn\\'t be promoted, and ifyou couldn\\'t switch ladders, promotion on this one was the only wayup.To someone who\\'d spent several formative years in the armed forces,this situation didn\\'t seem as strange as it does to us now.  Fromtheir point of view, as big company executives, they were high-rankingofficers.  They got paid a lot more than privates.  They got tohave expense account lunches at the best restaurants and fly aroundon the company\\'s Gulfstreams.  It probably didn\\'t occur to most ofthem to ask if they were being paid market price.The ultimate way to get market price is to work for yourself, bystarting your own company.  That seems obvious to any ambitiousperson now.  But in the mid 20th century it was an alien concept.Not because starting one\\'s own company seemed too ambitious, butbecause it didn\\'t seem ambitious enough. Even as late as the 1970s,when I grew up, the ambitious plan was to get lots of education atprestigious institutions, and then join some other prestigiousinstitution and work one\\'s way up the hierarchy.  Your prestige wasthe prestige of the institution you belonged to.  People did starttheir own businesses of course, but educated people rarely did,because in those days there was practically zero concept of startingwhat we now call astartup: a business that starts small and growsbig.  That was much harder to do in the mid 20th century.  Startingone\\'s own business meant starting a business that would start smalland stay small. Which in those days of big companies often meantscurrying around trying to avoid being trampled by elephants.  Itwas more prestigious to be one of the executive class riding theelephant.By the 1970s, no one stopped to wonder where the big prestigiouscompanies had come from in the first place.  It seemed like they\\'dalways been there, like the chemical elements.  And indeed, therewas a double wall between ambitious kids in the 20th century andthe origins of the big companies.  Many of the big companies wereroll-ups that didn\\'t have clear founders.  And when they did, thefounders didn\\'t seem like us.  Nearly all of them had been uneducated,in the sense of not having been to college.  They were what Shakespearecalled rude mechanicals.  College trained one to be a member of theprofessional classes.  Its graduates didn\\'t expect to do the sortof grubby menial work that Andrew Carnegie or Henry Ford startedout doing.And in the 20th century there were more and more college graduates.They increased from about 2% of the population in 1900 to about 25%in 2000. In the middle of the century our two big forces intersect,in the form of the GI Bill, which sent 2.2 million World War IIveterans to college.  Few thought of it in these terms, but theresult of making college the canonical path for the ambitious wasa world in which it was socially acceptable to work for Henry Ford,but not to be Henry Ford.I remember this world well. I came of age just as it was startingto break up. In my childhood it was still dominant. Not quite sodominant as it had been.  We could see from old TV shows and yearbooksand the way adults acted that people in the 1950s and 60s had beeneven more conformist than us.  The mid-century model was alreadystarting to get old. But that was not how we saw it at the time.We would at most have said that one could be a bit more daring in1975 than 1965.  And indeed, things hadn\\'t changed much yet.But change was coming soon. And when the Duplo economy started todisintegrate, it disintegrated in several different ways at once.Vertically integrated companies literally dis-integrated becauseit was more efficient to.  Incumbents faced new competitors as (a)markets went global and (b) technical innovation started to trumpeconomies of scale, turning size from an asset into a liability.Smaller companies were increasingly able to survive as formerlynarrow channels to consumers broadened.  Markets themselves startedto change faster, as whole new categories of products appeared. Andlast but not least, the federal government, which had previouslysmiled upon J. P. Morgan\\'s world as the natural state of things,began to realize it wasn\\'t the last word after all.What J. P. Morgan was to the horizontal axis, Henry Ford was to thevertical.  He wanted to do everything himself. The giant plant hebuilt at River Rouge between 1917 and 1928 literally took in ironore at one end and sent cars out the other.  100,000 people workedthere. At the time it seemed the future. But that is not how carcompanies operate today.  Now much of the design and manufacturinghappens in a long supply chain, whose products the car companiesultimately assemble and sell.  The reason car companies operatethis way is that it works better.  Each company in the supply chainfocuses on what they know best. And they each have to do it wellor they can be swapped out for another supplier.Why didn\\'t Henry Ford realize that networks of cooperating companieswork better than a single big company? One reason is that suppliernetworks take a while to evolve. In 1917, doing everything himselfseemed to Ford the only way to get the scale he needed. And thesecond reason is that if you want to solve a problem using a networkof cooperating companies, you have to be able to coordinate theirefforts, and you can do that much better with computers.  Computersreduce the transaction costs that Coase argued are the raison d\\'etreof corporations. That is a fundamental change.In the early 20th century, big companies were synonymous withefficiency.  In the late 20th century they were synonymous withinefficiency.  To some extent this was because the companiesthemselves had become sclerotic.  But it was also because ourstandards were higher.It wasn\\'t just within existing industries that change occurred.The industries themselves changed.  It became possible to make lotsof new things, and sometimes the existing companies weren\\'t theones who did it best.Microcomputers are a classic example. The market was pioneered byupstarts like Apple. When it got big enough, IBM decided it wasworth paying attention to.  At the time IBM completely dominatedthe computer industry. They assumed that all they had to do, nowthat this market was ripe, was to reach out and pick it.  Mostpeople at the time would have agreed with them.  But what happenednext illustrated how much more complicated the world had become.IBM did launch a microcomputer.  Though quite successful, it didnot crush Apple.  But even more importantly, IBM itself ended upbeing supplanted by a supplier coming in from the side — fromsoftware, which didn\\'t even seem to be the same business.  IBM\\'sbig mistake was to accept a non-exclusive license for DOS.  It musthave seemed a safe move at the time.  No other computer manufacturerhad ever been able to outsell them. What difference did it make ifother manufacturers could offer DOS too?  The result of thatmiscalculation was an explosion of inexpensive PC clones.  Microsoftnow owned the PC standard, and the customer.  And the microcomputerbusiness ended up being Apple vs Microsoft.Basically, Apple bumped IBM and then Microsoft stole its wallet.That sort of thing did not happen to big companies in mid-century.But it was going to happen increasingly often in the future.Change happened mostly by itself in the computer business.  In otherindustries, legal obstacles had to be removed first.  Many of themid-century oligopolies had been anointed by the federal governmentwith policies (and in wartime, large orders) that kept out competitors.This didn\\'t seem as dubious to government officials at the time asit sounds to us. They felt a two-party system ensured sufficientcompetition in politics.  It ought to work for business too.Gradually the government realized that anti-competitive policieswere doing more harm than good, and during the Carter administrationit started to remove them. The word used for this process wasmisleadingly narrow: deregulation.  What was really happening wasde-oligopolization.  It happened to one industry after another.Two of the most visible to consumers were air travel and long-distancephone service, which both became dramatically cheaper afterderegulation.Deregulation also contributed to the wave of hostile takeovers inthe 1980s.  In the old days the only limit on the inefficiency ofcompanies, short of actual bankruptcy, was the inefficiency of theircompetitors.  Now companies had to face absolute rather than relativestandards.  Any public company that didn\\'t generate sufficientreturns on its assets risked having its management replaced withone that would.  Often the new managers did this by breaking companiesup into components that were more valuable separately.Version 1 of the national economy consisted of a few big blockswhose relationships were negotiated in back rooms by a handful ofexecutives, politicians, regulators, and labor leaders.  Version 2was higher resolution: there were more companies, of more differentsizes, making more different things, and their relationships changedfaster. In this world there were still plenty of back room negotiations,but more was left to market forces.  Which further accelerated thefragmentation.It\\'s a little misleading to talk of versions when describing agradual process, but not as misleading as it might seem.  There wasa lot of change in a few decades, and what we ended up with wasqualitatively different.  The companies in the S&P 500 in 1958 hadbeen there an average of 61 years. By 2012 that number was 18 years.The breakup of the Duplo economy happened simultaneously with thespread of computing power. To what extent were computers a precondition?It would take a book to answer that. Obviously the spread of computingpower was a precondition for the rise of startups.  I suspect itwas for most of what happened in finance too.  But was it aprecondition for globalization or the LBO wave?  I don\\'t know, butI wouldn\\'t discount the possibility.  It may be that the refragmentationwas driven by computers in the way the industrial revolution wasdriven by steam engines.  Whether or not computers were a precondition,they have certainly accelerated it.The new fluidity of companies changed people\\'s relationships withtheir employers. Why climb a corporate ladder that might be yankedout from under you?  Ambitious people started to think of a careerless as climbing a single ladder than as a series of jobs that mightbe at different companies. More movement (or even potential movement)between companies introduced more competition in salaries.  Plusas companies became smaller it became easier to estimate how muchan employee contributed to the company\\'s revenue.  Both changesdrove salaries toward market price. And since people vary dramaticallyin productivity, paying market price meant salaries started todiverge.By no coincidence it was in the early 1980s that the term \"yuppie\"was coined.  That word is not much used now, because the phenomenonit describes is so taken for granted, but at the time it was a labelfor something novel. Yuppies were young professionals who made lotsof money.  To someone in their twenties today, this wouldn\\'t seemworth naming.  Why wouldn\\'t young professionals make lots of money?But until the 1980s, being underpaid early in your career was partof what it meant to be a professional.  Young professionals werepaying their dues, working their way up the ladder.  The rewardswould come later.  What was novel about yuppies was that they wantedmarket price for the work they were doing now.The first yuppies did not work for startups. That was still in thefuture.  Nor did they work for big companies. They were professionalsworking in fields like law, finance, and consulting.  But their example rapidly inspired their peers.  Once they saw that new BMW 325i, they wanted one too.Underpaying people at the beginning of their career only works ifeveryone does it. Once some employer breaks ranks, everyone elsehas to, or they can\\'t get good people.  And once started this processspreads through the whole economy, because at the beginnings ofpeople\\'s careers they can easily switch not merely employers butindustries.But not all young professionals benefitted. You had to produce toget paid a lot.  It was no coincidence that the first yuppies workedin fields where it was easy to measure that.More generally, an idea was returning whose name sounds old-fashionedprecisely because it was so rare for so long: that you could makeyour fortune.  As in the past there were multiple ways to do it.Some made their fortunes by creating wealth, and others by playingzero-sum games. But once it became possible to make one\\'s fortune,the ambitious had to decide whether or not to.  A physicist whochose physics over Wall Street in 1990 was making a sacrifice thata physicist in 1960 didn\\'t have to think about.The idea even flowed back into big companies.  CEOs of big companiesmake more now than they used to, and I think much of the reason isprestige.  In 1960, corporate CEOs had immense prestige.  They werethe winners of the only economic game in town. But if they made aslittle now as they did then, in real dollar terms, they\\'d seem likesmall fry compared to professional athletes and whiz kids makingmillions from startups and hedge funds. They don\\'t like that idea,so now they try to get as much as they can, which is more than theyhad been getting.Meanwhile a similar fragmentation was happening at the other endof the economic scale.  As big companies\\' oligopolies became lesssecure, they were less able to pass costs on to customers and thusless willing to overpay for labor.  And as the Duplo world of a fewbig blocks fragmented into many companies of different sizes — someof them overseas — it became harder for unions to enforce theirmonopolies.  As a result workers\\' wages also tended toward marketprice. Which (inevitably, if unions had been doing their job) tendedto be lower.  Perhaps dramatically so, if automation had decreasedthe need for some kind of work.And just as the mid-century model induced social as well as economiccohesion, its breakup brought social as well as economic fragmentation.People started to dress and act differently.  Those who would laterbe called the \"creative class\" became more mobile. People who didn\\'tcare much for religion felt less pressure to go to church forappearances\\' sake, while those who liked it a lot opted forincreasingly colorful forms. Some switched from meat loaf to tofu,and others to Hot Pockets. Some switched from driving Ford sedansto driving small imported cars, and others to driving SUVs.  Kidswho went to private schools or wished they did started to dress\"preppy,\" and kids who wanted to seem rebellious made a consciouseffort to look disreputable.  In a hundred ways people spread apart.Almost four decades later, fragmentation is still increasing.  Hasit been net good or bad?  I don\\'t know; the question may beunanswerable.  Not entirely bad though.  We take for granted theforms of fragmentation we like, and worry only about the ones wedon\\'t. But as someone who caught the tail end of mid-centuryconformism, I can tell you it was no utopia.My goal here is not to say whether fragmentation has been good orbad, just to explain why it\\'s happening.  With the centripetalforces of total war and 20th century oligopoly mostly gone, whatwill happen next?  And more specifically, is it possible to reversesome of the fragmentation we\\'ve seen?If it is, it will have to happen piecemeal.  You can\\'t reproducemid-century cohesion the way it was originally produced.  It wouldbe insane to go to war just to induce more national unity.  Andonce you understand the degree to which the economic history of the20th century was a low-res version 1, it\\'s clear you can\\'t reproducethat either.20th century cohesion was something that happened at least in asense naturally.  The war was due mostly to external forces, andthe Duplo economy was an evolutionary phase.  If you want cohesionnow, you\\'d have to induce it deliberately.  And it\\'s not obvioushow.  I suspect the best we\\'ll be able to do is address the symptomsof fragmentation.  But that may be enough.The form of fragmentation people worry most about lately iseconomic inequality, and if you want to eliminatethat you\\'re up against a truly formidable headwind that hasbeen in operation since the stone age. Technology.Technology isa lever. It magnifies work.  And the lever not only grows increasinglylong, but the rate at which it grows is itself increasing.Which in turn means the variation in the amount of wealth peoplecan create has not only been increasing, but accelerating.  Theunusual conditions that prevailed in the mid 20th century maskedthis underlying trend.  The ambitious had little choice but to joinlarge organizations that made them march in step with lots of otherpeople — literally in the case of the armed forces, figurativelyin the case of big corporations. Even if the big corporations hadwanted to pay people proportionate to their value, they couldn\\'thave figured out how.  But that constraint has gone now.  Ever sinceit started to erode in the 1970s, we\\'ve seen the underlying forcesat work again.Not everyone who gets rich now does it by creating wealth, certainly.But a significant number do, and the Baumol Effect means all theirpeers get dragged along too.And as long as it\\'s possible toget rich by creating wealth, the default tendency will be foreconomic inequality to increase.  Even if you eliminate all theother ways to get rich.  You can mitigate this with subsidies atthe bottom and taxes at the top, but unless taxes are high enoughto discourage people from creating wealth, you\\'re always going tobe fighting a losing battle against increasing variation inproductivity.That form of fragmentation, like the others, is here to stay.  Orrather, back to stay.  Nothing is forever, but the tendency towardfragmentation should be more forever than most things, preciselybecause it\\'s not due to any particular cause.  It\\'s simply a reversionto the mean. When Rockefeller said individualism was gone, he wasright for a hundred years.  It\\'s back now, and that\\'s likely to betrue for longer.I worry that if we don\\'t acknowledge this, we\\'re headed for trouble.If we think 20th century cohesion disappeared because of few policytweaks, we\\'ll be deluded into thinking we can get it back (minusthe bad parts, somehow) with a few countertweaks.  And then we\\'llwaste our time trying to eliminate fragmentation, when we\\'d bebetter off thinking about how to mitigate its consequences.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': '(This essay is derived from a keynote talk at PyCon 2003.)It\\'s hard to predict whatlife will be like in a hundred years.  There are only a fewthings we can say with certainty.  We know that everyone willdrive flying cars,that zoning laws will be relaxed to allow buildingshundreds of stories tall, that it will be dark most of thetime, and that women will all be trained in the martial arts.  Here I want to zoom in on one detail of thispicture.  What kind of programming language will they use towrite the software controlling those flying cars?This is worth thinking about not somuch because we\\'ll actually get to use these languages as because,if we\\'re lucky, we\\'ll use languages on the path from thispoint to that.I think that, like species, languages will form evolutionary trees,with dead-ends branching off all over.  We can see thishappening already.Cobol, for all its sometime popularity, does not seem to have anyintellectual descendants.  It is an evolutionary dead-end-- aNeanderthal language.I predict a similar fate for Java.  Peoplesometimes send me mail saying, \"How can you say that Javawon\\'t turn out to be a successful language?  It\\'s alreadya successful language.\"  And I admit that it is, if youmeasure success by shelf space taken up by books on it(particularly individual books on it), or bythe number of undergrads who believe they have tolearn it to get a job.  When I say Java won\\'tturn out to be a successful language, I mean something morespecific:  that Javawill turn out to be an evolutionary dead-end, like Cobol.This is just a guess.  I may be wrong.  My point here is not to dis Java,but to raise the issue of evolutionarytrees and get people asking, where on the tree is language X?The reason to ask this question isn\\'t just so thatour ghosts can say, in ahundred years, I told you so.  It\\'s because staying close to  the main branches is a useful heuristic for finding languages that willbe good to program in now.At any given time, you\\'re probably happiest onthe main branches of an evolutionary tree.Even when there were still plenty of Neanderthals, it must have sucked to be one.  TheCro-Magnons would have been constantly coming over andbeating you up and stealing your food.The reason I want toknow what languages will be like in a hundred years is so thatI know what branch of the tree to bet on now.The evolution of languages differs from the evolution of speciesbecause branches can converge.  The Fortran branch, for example,seems to be merging with the descendantsof Algol.  In theory this is possible for species too, but it\\'snot likely to have happened to any bigger than a cell.Convergenceis more likely for languages partly because the space ofpossibilities is smaller, and partly because mutationsare not random.  Language designers deliberately incorporateideas from other languages.It\\'s especially useful for language designers to thinkabout where the evolution of programming languages is likelyto lead, because they can steer accordingly. In that case, \"stay on a main branch\" becomes more than away to choose a good language.It becomes a heuristic for making the right decisions aboutlanguage design.Any programming language can be divided intotwo parts:  some set of fundamental operators that play the roleof axioms, and the rest of the language, which could in principlebe written in terms of these fundamental operators.I think the fundamental operators are the most important factor in alanguage\\'s long term survival.  The rest you can change.  It\\'slike the rule that in buying a house you should considerlocation first of all.  Everything else you can fix later, but youcan\\'t fix the location.I think it\\'s important not just that the axioms be well chosen, but that there be few of them.  Mathematicians have always felt this way about axioms-- the fewer, the better-- and I think they\\'reonto something.At the very least, it has to be a useful exercise to look closelyat the core of a language to see if there are any axioms thatcould be weeded out.  I\\'ve found in my long career as a slob thatcruft breeds cruft, and I\\'ve seen this happen in software aswell as under beds and in the corners of rooms.I have a hunch thatthe main branches of the evolutionary tree pass through the languagesthat have the smallest, cleanest cores.The more of a language you can write in itself,the better.Of course, I\\'m making a big assumption in even asking whatprogramming languages will be like in a hundred years.Will we even be writing programs in a hundred years?  Won\\'twe just tell computers what we want them to do?There hasn\\'t been a lot of progress in that departmentso far.My guess is that a hundred years from now people willstill tell computers what to do using programs we would recognizeas such.  There may be tasks that wesolve now by writing programs and which in a hundred yearsyou won\\'t have to write programs to solve, but I thinkthere will still be a good deal ofprogramming of the type that we do today.It may seem presumptuous to think anyone can predict whatany technology will look like in a hundred years.  Butremember that we already have almost fifty years of history behind us.Looking forward a hundred years is a graspable ideawhen we consider how slowly languages have evolved in thepast fifty.Languages evolve slowly because they\\'re not really technologies.Languages are notation.  A program is a formal description of the problem you want a computer to solve for you.  So the rateof evolution in programming languages is more like therate of evolution in mathematical notation than, say,transportation or communications.Mathematical notation does evolve, but not with the giantleaps you see in technology.Whatever computers are made of in a hundred years, it seems  safe to predict they will be much faster thanthey are now.  If Moore\\'s Law continues to put out, they will be 74quintillion (73,786,976,294,838,206,464) times faster.  That\\'s kind ofhard to imagine.  And indeed, the most likely prediction in thespeed department may be that Moore\\'s Law will stop working.Anything that is supposed to double every eighteen months seemslikely to run up against some kind of fundamental limit eventually.But I have no trouble believing that computers will be very muchfaster. Even if they only end up being a paltry milliontimes faster, that should change the ground rules for programminglanguages substantially.  Among other things, therewill be more room for whatwould now be considered slow languages, meaning languagesthat don\\'t yield very efficient code.And yet some applications will still demand speed.Some of the problems we want to solve withcomputers are created by computers; for example, therate at which you have to process video images dependson the rate at which another computer cangenerate them.  And there is another class of problemswhich inherently have an unlimited capacity to soak up cycles:image rendering, cryptography, simulations.If some applications can be increasingly inefficient whileothers continue to demand all the speed the hardware candeliver, faster computers will mean that languages haveto cover an ever wider range of efficiencies.  We\\'ve seenthis happening already.  Current implementations of somepopular new languages are shockingly wasteful by thestandards of previous decades.This isn\\'t just something that happens with programminglanguages.  It\\'s a general historical trend.  As technologies improve,each generation can do things that the previous generationwould have considered wasteful.  People thirty years ago wouldbe astonished at how casually we make long distance phone calls.People a hundred years ago would be even more astonished that a package would one day travel from Boston to New York via Memphis.I can already tell you what\\'s going to happen to all those extracycles that faster hardware is going to give us in the   next hundred years.  They\\'re nearly all going to be wasted.I learned to program when computer power was scarce.I can remember taking all the spaces out of my Basic programsso they would fit into the memory of a 4K TRS-80.  Thethought of all this stupendously inefficient softwareburning up cycles doing the same thing over and over seemskind of gross to me.  But I think my intuitions here are wrong.  I\\'mlike someone who grew up poor, and can\\'t bear to spend moneyeven for something important, like going to the doctor.Some kinds of waste really are disgusting.  SUVs, for example, wouldarguably be gross even if they ran on a fuel which would neverrun out and generated no pollution.  SUVs are gross because they\\'rethe solution to a gross problem. (How to make minivans look moremasculine.)But not all waste is bad.  Now that we have the infrastructureto support it, counting the minutes of your long-distancecalls starts to seem niggling.   If you have theresources, it\\'s more elegant to think of all phone calls asone kind of thing, no matter where the other person is.There\\'s good waste, and bad waste.  I\\'m interestedin good waste-- the kind where, by spending more, we can get  simpler designs.  How will we take advantage of the opportunitiesto waste cycles that we\\'ll get from new, faster hardware?The desire for speed is so deeply engrained in us, with our puny computers, that it will take a conscious effortto overcome it.  In language design, we should be consciously seeking outsituations where we can trade efficiency for even thesmallest increase in convenience.Most data structures exist because of speed.  For example,many languages today have both strings and lists.  Semantically, stringsare more or less a subset of lists in which the elements arecharacters.  So why do you need a separate data type?You don\\'t, really.  Strings onlyexist for efficiency.  But it\\'s lame to clutter up the semanticsof the language with hacks to make programs run faster.Having strings in a language seems to be a case ofpremature optimization.If we think of the core of a language as a set of axioms,  surely it\\'s gross to have additional axioms that add no expressivepower, simply for the sake of efficiency.  Efficiency isimportant, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the right way to get it.The right way to solve that problem, I think, is to separatethe meaning of a program from the implementation details. Instead of having both lists and strings, have just lists,with some way to give the compiler optimization advice that will allow it to lay out strings as contiguous bytes ifnecessary.Since speed doesn\\'t matter in most of a program, you won\\'tordinarily need to bother withthis sort of micromanagement.This will be more and more true as computers get faster.Saying less about implementation should also make programsmore flexible.Specifications change while a program is being written, and this is notonly inevitable, but desirable.The word \"essay\" comesfrom the French verb \"essayer\", which means \"to try\".An essay, in the original sense, is something youwrite to try to figure something out.  This happens insoftware too.  I think some of the best programs were essays,in the sense that the authors didn\\'t know when they startedexactly what they were trying to write.Lisp hackers already know about the value of being flexiblewith data structures.  We tend to write the first version ofa program so that it does everything with lists.  Theseinitial versions can be so shockingly inefficient that ittakes a conscious effort not to think about what they\\'redoing, just as, for me at least, eating a steak requires aconscious effort not to think where it came from.What programmers in a hundred years will be looking for, most ofall, is a language where you can throw together an unbelievablyinefficient version 1 of a program with the least possibleeffort.  At least, that\\'s how we\\'d describe it in present-dayterms.  What they\\'ll say is that they want a language that\\'seasy to program in.Inefficient software isn\\'t gross.  What\\'s gross is a languagethat makes programmers do needless work.  Wasting programmer timeis the true inefficiency, not wasting machine time.  This willbecome ever more clear as computers get faster.I think getting rid of strings is already something wecould bear to think about.  We did it inArc, and it seemsto be a win;  some operations that would be awkward todescribe as regular expressions can be describedeasily as recursive functions.How far will this flattening of data structures go?  I can thinkof possibilities that shock even me, with my conscientiously broadenedmind.  Will we get rid of arrays, for example?  After all, they\\'rejust a subset of hash tables where the keys are vectors ofintegers.   Will we replace hash tables themselves with lists?There are more shocking prospects even than that.  The Lispthat McCarthy described in 1960, for example, didn\\'thave numbers.  Logically, you don\\'t need to have a separate notionof numbers, because you can represent them as lists:  the integern could be represented as a list of n elements.  You can do math thisway.  It\\'s just unbearably inefficient.No one actually proposed implementing numbers as lists inpractice.  In fact, McCarthy\\'s 1960 paper was not, at the time,intended to be implemented at all.  It was atheoretical exercise,an attempt to create a more elegant alternative to the TuringMachine.  When someone did, unexpectedly, take this paper andtranslate it into a working Lisp interpreter, numbers certainlyweren\\'t represented as lists; they were represented in binary,as in every other language.Could a programming language go so far as to get rid of numbersas a fundamental data type?  I ask this not so much as a seriousquestion as as a way to play chicken with the future.  It\\'s likethe hypothetical case of an irresistible force meeting an immovable object-- here, an unimaginably inefficientimplementation meeting unimaginably great resources.I don\\'t see why not.  The future is pretty long.  If there\\'ssomething we can do to decrease the number of axioms in the corelanguage, that would seem to be the side to bet on as t approachesinfinity.  If the idea still seems unbearable in a hundred years,maybe it won\\'t in a thousand.Just to be clear about this, I\\'m not proposing that all numericalcalculations would actually be carried out using lists.  I\\'m proposingthat the core language, prior to any additional notations aboutimplementation, be defined this way.  In practice any programthat wanted to do any amount of math would probably representnumbers in binary, but this would be an optimization, not part ofthe core language semantics.Another way to burn up cycles is to have many layers ofsoftware between the application and the hardware.  This too isa trend we see happening already: many recent languages arecompiled into byte code.  Bill Woods once told me that,as a rule of thumb, each layer of interpretation costs afactor of 10 in speed.  This extra cost buys you flexibility.The very first version of Arc was an extreme case of this sortof multi-level slowness, with corresponding benefits.  Itwas a classic \"metacircular\" interpreter writtenon top of Common Lisp, with a definite family resemblanceto the eval function defined in McCarthy\\'s original Lisp paper.The whole thing was only a couple hundred lines ofcode, so it was very easy to understand and change.  The Common Lisp we used, CLisp, itself runs on topof a byte code interpreter.  So here we had two levels ofinterpretation, one of them (the top one) shockingly inefficient,and the language was usable.  Barely usable, I admit, butusable.Writing software as multiple layers is a powerful techniqueeven within applications.  Bottom-up programming means writinga program as a series of layers, each of which serves as alanguage for the one above.  This approach tends to yieldsmaller, more flexible programs.  It\\'s also the best route to   that holy grail, reusability.  A language is by definitionreusable.  The moreof your application you can push down into a language for writingthat type of application, the more of your software will be reusable.Somehow the idea of reusability got attachedto object-oriented programming in the 1980s, and no amount ofevidence to the contrary seems to be able to shake it free.  Butalthough some object-oriented software is reusable, what makesit reusable is its bottom-upness, not its object-orientedness.Consider libraries: they\\'re reusable because they\\'re language,whether they\\'re written in an object-oriented style or not.I don\\'t predict the demise of object-oriented programming, by theway.  Though I don\\'t think it has much to offer good programmers,except in certain specialized domains, it is irresistible to   large organizations.  Object-oriented programmingoffers a sustainable way to write spaghetti code.  It lets you accreteprograms as a series of patches.Large organizationsalways tend to develop software this way, and I expect thisto be as true in a hundred years as it is today.As long as we\\'re talking about the future, we had bettertalk about parallel computation, because that\\'s where this idea seems to live.  That is, no matter when you\\'re talking, parallelcomputation seems to be something that is going to happenin the future.Will the future ever catch up with it?  People have beentalking about parallel computation as something imminent for at least 20years, and it hasn\\'t affected programming practice much so far.Or hasn\\'t it?  Alreadychip designers have to think about it, and so mustpeople trying to write systems software on multi-cpu computers.The real question is, how far up the ladder of abstraction willparallelism go?In a hundred years will it affect even application programmers?  Orwill it be something that compiler writers think about, butwhich is usually invisible in the source code of applications?One thing that does seem likely is that most opportunities forparallelism will be wasted.  This is a special case of my more   general prediction that most of the extra computer power we\\'regiven will go to waste.  I expect that, as with the stupendousspeed of the underlying hardware, parallelism will be somethingthat is available if you ask for it explicitly, but ordinarilynot used.  This implies that the kind of parallelism we have ina hundred years will not, except in special applications, bemassive parallelism.  I expect forordinary programmers it will be more like being able to fork offprocesses that all end up running in parallel.And this will, like asking for specific implementations of datastructures, be something that you do fairly late in the life of aprogram, when you try to optimize it.  Version 1s will ordinarilyignore any advantages to be got from parallel computation, justas they will ignore advantages to be got from specific representationsof data.Except in special kinds of applications, parallelism won\\'tpervade the programs that are written in a hundred years.  It would bepremature optimization if it did.How many programming languages will therebe in a hundred years?  There seem to be a huge number of newprogramming languages lately.  Part of the reason is thatfaster hardware has allowed programmers to make differenttradeoffs between speed and convenience, depending on theapplication.  If this is a real trend, the hardware we\\'ll  have in a hundred years should only increase it.And yet there may be only a few widely-used languages in ahundred years.  Part of the reason I say thisis optimism: it seems that, if you did a really good job,you could make a language that was ideal for writing a   slow version 1, and yet with the right optimization adviceto the compiler, would also yield very fast code when necessary.So, since I\\'m optimistic, I\\'m going to predict that despitethe huge gap they\\'ll have between acceptable and maximalefficiency, programmers in a hundred years will have languages that can span most of it.As this gap widens, profilers will become increasingly important.Little attention is paid to profiling now.  Many people stillseem to believe that the way to get fast applications is towrite compilers that generate fast code.  As the gap between    acceptable and maximal performance widens, it will becomeincreasingly clear that the way to get fast applications is   to have a good guide from one to the other.When I say there may only be a few languages, I\\'m not includingdomain-specific \"little languages\".  I think such embedded languagesare a great idea, and I expect them to proliferate.  But I expectthem to be written as thin enough skins that users can seethe general-purpose language underneath.Who will design the languages of the future?  One of the most excitingtrends in the last ten years has been the rise of open-source  languages like Perl, Python, and Ruby.Language design is being taken over by hackers.  The resultsso far are messy, but encouraging.  There are some stunningly  novel ideas in Perl, for example. Many are stunningly bad, butthat\\'s always true of ambitious efforts.  At its current rateof mutation, God knows what Perl might evolve into in a hundredyears.It\\'s not true that those who can\\'t do, teach (some of the besthackers I know are professors), but it is true that there are alot of things that those who teach can\\'t do.Researchimposesconstraining caste restrictions.  In any academicfield there are topics that are ok to work on and others thataren\\'t.  Unfortunately the distinction between acceptable andforbidden topics is usually based on how intellectualthe work sounds when described in research papers, rather thanhow important it is for getting good results.  The extreme caseis probably literature; people studying literature rarely  say anything that would be of the slightest use to thoseproducing it.Though the situation is better in the sciences,the overlap between the kind of work you\\'re allowed to do and thekind of work that yields good languages is distressingly small.(Olin Shivers has grumbled eloquentlyabout this.)  For example, types seem to be an inexhaustible sourceof research papers, despite the fact that static typingseems to preclude true macros-- without which, in my opinion, nolanguage is worth using.The trend is not merely toward languages being developedas open-source projects rather than \"research\", but towardlanguages being designed by the application programmers who needto use them, rather than by compiler writers.  This seems a goodtrend and I expect it to continue.Unlike physics in a hundred years, which is almost necessarilyimpossible to predict, I think it may be possible in principleto design a language now that would appeal to users in a hundredyears.One way to design a language is to just write down the programyou\\'d like to be able to write, regardless of whether there is a compiler that can translate it or hardware that can run it.When you do this you can assume unlimited resources.  It seemslike we ought to be able to imagine unlimited resources as welltoday as in a hundred years.What program would one like to write?  Whatever is least work.Except not quite: whateverwould beleast work if your ideas aboutprogramming weren\\'t already influenced by the languages you\\'re currently used to.  Such influence can be so pervasive that   it takes a great effort to overcome it.  You\\'d think it wouldbe obvious to creatures as lazy as us how to express a programwith the least effort.  In fact, our ideas about what\\'s possibletend to be solimitedby whatever language we think in  thateasier formulations of programs seem very surprising.  They\\'resomething you have to discover, not something you naturallysink into.One helpful trick hereis to use thelengthof the program as an approximation forhow much work it is to write.  Not the length in characters,of course, but the length in distinct syntactic elements-- basically,the size of the parse tree.  It may not be quite true thatthe shortest program is the least work to write, but it\\'sclose enough that you\\'re better off aiming for the solidtarget of brevity than the fuzzy, nearby one of least work.Then the algorithm for language design becomes: look at a programand ask, is there any way to write this that\\'s shorter?In practice, writing programs in an imaginary hundred-yearlanguage will work to varying degrees dependingon how close you are to the core.  Sort routines you canwrite now.  But it would behard to predict now what kinds of libraries might be needed ina hundred years.  Presumably many libraries will be for domains thatdon\\'t even exist yet.  If SETI@home works, for example, we\\'ll  need libraries for communicating with aliens.  Unless of coursethey are sufficiently advanced that they already communicatein XML.At the other extreme, I think you might be able to design thecore language today.  In fact, some might argue that it was alreadymostly designed in 1958.If the hundred year language were available today, would wewant to program in it?  One way to answer this question is tolook back.  If present-day programming languages had been availablein 1960, would anyone have wanted to use them?In some ways, the answer is no.  Languages today assumeinfrastructure that didn\\'t exist in 1960.  For example, a languagein which indentation is significant, like Python, would notwork very well on printer terminals.  But putting such problemsaside-- assuming, for example, that programs were all justwritten on paper-- would programmers of the 1960s have likedwriting programs in the languages we use now?I think so.Some of the less imaginative ones,who had artifacts of early languages built into their ideas of  what a program was, might have had trouble.  (How can you manipulatedata without doing pointer arithmetic?  How can you implement flow charts without gotos?)  But I think the smartest programmerswould have had no trouble making the most of present-daylanguages, if they\\'d had them.If we had the hundred-year language now, it would at least make agreat pseudocode.  What about using it to write software?   Since the hundred-year languagewill need to generate fast code for some applications, presumablyit could generate code efficient enough to run acceptably wellon our hardware.  We might have to give more optimization advicethan users in a hundred years, but it still might be a net win.Now we have two ideas that, if you combine them, suggest interestingpossibilities: (1) the hundred-year language could, in principle, bedesigned today, and (2) such a language, if it existed, might be good toprogram in today.  When you see these ideas laid out like that,it\\'s hard not to think, why not try writing the hundred-year languagenow?When you\\'re working on language design, I think it is good tohave such a target and to keep it consciously in mind.  When youlearn to drive, one of the principles they teach you is toalign the car not by lining up the hood with the stripes paintedon the road, but by aiming at some point in the distance.  Evenif all you care about is what happens in the next ten feet, thisis the right answer.  Ithink we can and should do the same thing with programming languages.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.September 2012A startup is a company designed to grow fast.  Being newly foundeddoes not in itself make a company a startup.  Nor is it necessaryfor a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, orhave some sort of \"exit.\"  The only essential thing is growth.Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.If you want to start one it\\'s important to understand that. Startupsare so hard that you can\\'t be pointed off to the side and hope tosucceed.  You have to know that growth is what you\\'re after.  Thegood news is, if you get growth, everything else tends to fall intoplace.  Which means you can use growth like a compass to make almostevery decision you face.RedwoodsLet\\'s start with a distinction that should be obvious but is oftenoverlooked: not every newly founded company is a startup.  Millionsof companies are started every year in the US.  Only a tiny fractionare startups.  Most are service businesses — restaurants, barbershops,plumbers, and so on.  These are not startups, except in a few unusualcases.  A barbershop isn\\'t designed to grow fast.  Whereas a searchengine, for example, is.When I say startups are designed to grow fast, I mean it in twosenses.  Partly I mean designed in the sense of intended, becausemost startups fail.  But I also mean startups are different bynature, in the same way a redwood seedling has a different destinyfrom a bean sprout.That difference is why there\\'s a distinct word, \"startup,\" forcompanies designed to grow fast.  If all companies were essentiallysimilar, but some through luck or the efforts of their foundersended up growing very fast, we wouldn\\'t need a separate word.  Wecould just talk about super-successful companies and less successfulones.  But in fact startups do have a different sort of DNA fromother businesses.  Google is not just a barbershop whose founderswere unusually lucky and hard-working.  Google was different fromthe beginning.To grow rapidly, you need to make something you can sell to a bigmarket.  That\\'s the difference between Google and a barbershop.  Abarbershop doesn\\'t scale.For a company to grow really big, it must (a) make something lotsof people want, and (b) reach and serve all those people.  Barbershopsare doing fine in the (a) department.  Almost everyone needs theirhair cut.  The problem for a barbershop, as for any retailestablishment, is (b).  A barbershop serves customers in person,and few will travel far for a haircut.  And even if they did, thebarbershop couldn\\'t accomodate them.Writing software is a great way to solve (b), but you can still endup constrained in (a).  If you write software to teach Tibetan toHungarian speakers, you\\'ll be able to reach most of the people whowant it, but there won\\'t be many of them.   If you make softwareto teach English to Chinese speakers, however, you\\'re in startupterritory.Most businesses are tightly constrained in (a) or (b).  The distinctivefeature of successful startups is that they\\'re not.IdeasIt might seem that it would always be better to start a startupthan an ordinary business.  If you\\'re going to start a company, whynot start the type with the most potential?  The catch is that thisis a (fairly) efficient market.   If you write software to teachTibetan to Hungarians, you won\\'t have much competition.  If youwrite software to teach English to Chinese speakers, you\\'ll faceferocious competition, precisely because that\\'s such a larger prize.The constraints that limit ordinary companies also protect them.That\\'s the tradeoff.  If you start a barbershop, you only have tocompete with other local barbers.  If you start a search engine youhave to compete with the whole world.The most important thing that the constraints on a normal businessprotect it from is not competition, however, but the difficulty ofcoming up with new ideas.  If you open a bar in a particularneighborhood, as well as limiting your potential and protecting youfrom competitors, that geographic constraint also helps define yourcompany.  Bar + neighborhood is a sufficient idea for a smallbusiness.  Similarly for companies constrained in (a).  Your nicheboth protects and defines you.Whereas if you want to start a startup, you\\'re probably going tohave to think of something fairly novel.  A startup has to makesomething it can deliver to a large market, and ideas of that typeare so valuable that all the obvious ones are already taken.That space of ideas has been so thoroughly picked over that a startupgenerally has to work on something everyone else has overlooked.I was going to write that one has to make a conscious effort tofind ideas everyone else has overlooked.  But that\\'s not how moststartups get started.  Usually successful startups happen becausethe founders are sufficiently different from other people that ideasfew others can see seem obvious to them.  Perhaps later they stepback and notice they\\'ve found an idea in everyone else\\'s blind spot,and from that point make a deliberate effort to stay there.But at the moment when successful startups get started, much of theinnovation is unconscious.What\\'s different about successful founders is that they can seedifferent problems.  It\\'s a particularly good combination both tobe good at technology and to face problems that can be solved byit, because technology changes so rapidly that formerly bad ideasoften become good without anyone noticing.  Steve Wozniak\\'s problemwas that he wanted his own computer.  That was an unusual problemto have in 1975.  But technological change was about to make it amuch more common one.  Because he not only wanted a computer butknew how to build them, Wozniak was able to make himself one.  Andthe problem he solved for himself became one that Apple solved formillions of people in the coming years.  But by the time it wasobvious to ordinary people that this was a big market, Apple wasalready established.Google has similar origins.  Larry Page and Sergey Brin wanted tosearch the web.  But unlike most people they had the technicalexpertise both to notice that existing search engines were not asgood as they could be, and to know how to improve them.  Over thenext few years their problem became everyone\\'s problem, as the webgrew to a size where you didn\\'t have to be a picky search expertto notice the old algorithms weren\\'t good enough.  But as happenedwith Apple, by the time everyone else realized how important searchwas, Google was entrenched.That\\'s one connection between startup ideas and technology.  Rapidchange in one area uncovers big, soluble problems in other areas.Sometimes the changes are advances, and what they change is solubility.That was the kind of change that yielded Apple; advances in chiptechnology finally let Steve Wozniak design a computer he couldafford.  But in Google\\'s case the most important change was thegrowth of the web. What changed there was not solubility but bigness.The other connection between startups and technology is that startupscreate new ways of doing things, and new ways of doing things are,in the broader sense of the word, new technology.  When a startup both begins with anidea exposed by technological change and makes a product consistingof technology in the narrower sense (what used to be called \"hightechnology\"), it\\'s easy to conflate the two.  But the two connectionsare distinct and in principle one could start a startup that wasneither driven by technological change, nor whose product consistedof technology except in the broader sense.RateHow fast does a company have to grow to be considered a startup?There\\'s no precise answer to that.  \"Startup\" is a pole, not athreshold.  Starting one is at first no more than a declaration ofone\\'s ambitions.  You\\'re committing not just to starting a company,but to starting a fast growing one, and you\\'re thus committing tosearch for one of the rare ideas of that type.  But at first youhave no more than commitment.  Starting a startup is like being anactor in that respect.  \"Actor\" too is a pole rather than a threshold.At the beginning of his career, an actor is a waiter who goes toauditions.  Getting work makes him a successful actor, but he doesn\\'tonly become an actor when he\\'s successful.So the real question is not what growth rate makes a company astartup, but what growth rate successful startups tend to have.For founders that\\'s more than a theoretical question, because it\\'sequivalent to asking if they\\'re on the right path.The growth of a successful startup usually has three phases:There\\'s an initial period of slow or no growth while the startup  tries to figure out what it\\'s doing.As the startup figures out how to make something lots of people  want and how to reach those people, there\\'s a period of rapid  growth.Eventually a successful startup will grow into a big company.  Growth will slow, partly due to internal limits and partly because  the company is starting to bump up against the limits of the  markets it serves.Together these three phases produce an S-curve.  The phase whosegrowth defines the startup is the second one, the ascent.  Itslength and slope determine how big the company will be.The slope is the company\\'s growth rate.  If there\\'s one number everyfounder should always know, it\\'s the company\\'s growth rate.  That\\'sthe measure of a startup.  If you don\\'t know that number, you don\\'teven know if you\\'re doing well or badly.When I first meet founders and ask what their growth rate is,sometimes they tell me \"we get about a hundred new customers amonth.\"  That\\'s not a rate.  What matters is not the absolute numberof new customers, but the ratio of new customers to existing ones.If you\\'re really getting a constant number of new customers everymonth, you\\'re in trouble, because that means your growth rate isdecreasing.During Y Combinator we measure growth rate per week, partly becausethere is so little time before Demo Day, and partly because startupsearly on need frequent feedback from their users to tweak whatthey\\'re doing.A good growth rate during YC is 5-7% a week.  If you can hit 10% aweek you\\'re doing exceptionally well.  If you can only manage 1%,it\\'s a sign you haven\\'t yet figured out what you\\'re doing.The best thing to measure the growth rate of is revenue.  The nextbest, for startups that aren\\'t charging initially, is active users.That\\'s a reasonable proxy for revenue growth because whenever thestartup does start trying to make money, their revenues will probablybe a constant multiple of active users.CompassWe usually advise startups to pick a growth rate they think theycan hit, and then just try to hit it every week.  The key word hereis \"just.\" If they decide to grow at 7% a week and they hit thatnumber, they\\'re successful for that week.  There\\'s nothing morethey need to do.  But if they don\\'t hit it, they\\'ve failed in theonly thing that mattered, and should be correspondingly alarmed.Programmers will recognize what we\\'re doing here.  We\\'re turningstarting a startup into an optimization problem.  And anyone whohas tried optimizing code knows how wonderfully effective that sortof narrow focus can be.  Optimizing code means taking an existingprogram and changing it to use less of something, usually time ormemory.  You don\\'t have to think about what the program should do,just make it faster.  For most programmers this is very satisfyingwork.  The narrow focus makes it a sort of puzzle, and you\\'regenerally surprised how fast you can solve it.Focusing on hitting a growth rate reduces the otherwise bewilderinglymultifarious problem of starting a startup to a single problem.You can use that target growth rate to make all your decisions foryou; anything that gets you the growth you need is ipso facto right.Should you spend two days at a conference?  Should you hire anotherprogrammer?  Should you focus more on marketing?  Should you spendtime courting some big customer?  Should you add x feature? Whatevergets you your target growth rate.Judging yourself by weekly growth doesn\\'t mean you can look no morethan a week ahead.  Once you experience the pain of missing yourtarget one week (it was the only thing that mattered, and you failedat it), you become interested in anything that could spare you suchpain in the future.  So you\\'ll be willing for example to hire anotherprogrammer, who won\\'t contribute to this week\\'s growth but perhapsin a month will have implemented some new feature that will get youmore users.   But only if (a) the distraction of hiring someonewon\\'t make you miss your numbers in the short term, and (b) you\\'resufficiently worried about whether you can keep hitting your numberswithout hiring someone new.It\\'s not that you don\\'t think about the future, just that you thinkabout it no more than necessary.In theory this sort of hill-climbing could get a startup intotrouble.  They could end up on a local maximum.  But in practicethat never happens.  Having to hit a growth number every week forcesfounders to act, and acting versus not acting is the high bit ofsucceeding.  Nine times out of ten, sitting around strategizing isjust a form of procrastination.  Whereas founders\\' intuitions aboutwhich hill to climb are usually better than they realize.  Plus themaxima in the space of startup ideas are not spiky and isolated.Most fairly good ideas are adjacent to even better ones.The fascinating thing about optimizing for growth is that it canactually discover startup ideas.  You can use the need for growthas a form of evolutionary pressure.  If you start out with someinitial plan and modify it as necessary to keep hitting, say, 10%weekly growth, you may end up with a quite different company thanyou meant to start.  But anything that grows consistently at 10% aweek is almost certainly a better idea than you started with.There\\'s a parallel here to small businesses.  Just as the constraintof being located in a particular neighborhood helps define a bar,the constraint of growing at a certain rate can help define astartup.You\\'ll generally do best to follow that constraint wherever it leadsrather than being influenced by some initial vision, just as ascientist is better off following the truth wherever it leads ratherthan being influenced by what he wishes were the case.  When RichardFeynman said that the imagination of nature was greater than theimagination of man, he meant that if you just keep following thetruth you\\'ll discover cooler things than you could ever have madeup. For startups, growth is a constraint much like truth. Everysuccessful startup is at least partly a product of the imaginationof growth.ValueIt\\'s hard to find something that grows consistently at severalpercent a week, but if you do you may have found something surprisinglyvaluable.  If we project forward we see why.weeklyyearly1%1.7x2%2.8x5%12.6x7%33.7x10%142.0xA company that grows at 1% a week will grow 1.7x a year, whereas acompany that grows at 5% a week will grow 12.6x.  A company making$1000 a month (a typical number early in YC) and growing at 1% aweek will 4 years later be making $7900 a month, which is less thana good programmer makes in salary in Silicon Valley.  A startupthat grows at 5% a week will in 4 years be making $25 million amonth.Our ancestors must rarely have encountered cases of exponentialgrowth, because our intuitions are no guide here.  What happensto fast growing startups tends to surprise even the founders.Small variations in growth rate produce qualitatively differentoutcomes.  That\\'s why there\\'s a separate word for startups, and whystartups do things that ordinary companies don\\'t, like raising moneyand getting acquired.  And, strangely enough, it\\'s also why theyfail so frequently.Considering how valuable a successful startup can become, anyonefamiliar with the concept of expected value would be surprised ifthe failure rate weren\\'t high.  If a successful startup could makea founder $100 million, then even if the chance of succeeding wereonly 1%, the expected value of starting one would be $1 million.And the probability of a group of sufficiently smart and determinedfounders succeeding on that scale might be significantly over 1%.For the right people — e.g. the young Bill Gates — the probabilitymight be 20% or even 50%.  So it\\'s not surprising that so many wantto take a shot at it.  In an efficient market, the number of failedstartups should be proportionate to the size of the successes.  Andsince the latter is huge the former should be too.What this means is that at any given time, the great majority ofstartups will be working on something that\\'s never going to goanywhere, and yet glorifying their doomed efforts with the grandiosetitle of \"startup.\"This doesn\\'t bother me.  It\\'s the same with other high-beta vocations,like being an actor or a novelist.  I\\'ve long since gotten used toit.  But it seems to bother a lot of people, particularly thosewho\\'ve started ordinary businesses.  Many are annoyed that theseso-called startups get all the attention, when hardly any of themwill amount to anything.If they stepped back and looked at the whole picture they might beless indignant.  The mistake they\\'re making is that by basing theiropinions on anecdotal evidence they\\'re implicitly judging by themedian rather than the average.  If you judge by the median startup,the whole concept of a startup seems like a fraud.  You have toinvent a bubble to explain why founders want to start them orinvestors want to fund them.  But it\\'s a mistake to use the medianin a domain with so much variation.  If you look at the averageoutcome rather than the median, you can understand why investorslike them, and why, if they aren\\'t median people, it\\'s a rationalchoice for founders to start them.DealsWhy do investors like startups so much?  Why are they so hot toinvest in photo-sharing apps, rather than solid money-makingbusinesses?  Not only for the obvious reason.The test of any investment is the ratio of return to risk.  Startupspass that test because although they\\'re appallingly risky, thereturns when they do succeed are so high.  But that\\'s not the onlyreason investors like startups.  An ordinary slower-growing businessmight have just as good a ratio of return to risk, if both werelower.  So why are VCs interested only in high-growth companies?The reason is that they get paid by getting their capital back,ideally after the startup IPOs, or failing that when it\\'s acquired.The other way to get returns from an investment is in the form ofdividends.  Why isn\\'t there a parallel VC industry that invests inordinary companies in return for a percentage of their profits?Because it\\'s too easy for people who control a private company tofunnel its revenues to themselves (e.g. by buying overpricedcomponents from a supplier they control) while making it look likethe company is making little profit.  Anyone who invested in privatecompanies in return for dividends would have to pay close attentionto their books.The reason VCs like to invest in startups is not simply the returns,but also because such investments are so easy to oversee.  Thefounders can\\'t enrich themselves without also enriching the investors.Why do founders want to take the VCs\\' money?  Growth, again.  Theconstraint between good ideas and growth operates in both directions.It\\'s not merely that you need a scalable idea to grow.  If you havesuch an idea and don\\'t grow fast enough, competitors will.  Growingtoo slowly is particularly dangerous in a business with networkeffects, which the best startups usually have to some degree.Almost every company needs some amount of funding to get started.But startups often raise money even when they are or could beprofitable.  It might seem foolish to sell stock in a profitablecompany for less than you think it will later be worth, but it\\'sno more foolish than buying insurance.  Fundamentally that\\'s howthe most successful startups view fundraising.  They could grow thecompany on its own revenues, but the extra money and help suppliedby VCs will let them grow even faster.  Raising money lets youchooseyour growth rate.Money to grow faster is always at the command of the most successfulstartups, because the VCs need them more than they need the VCs.A profitable startup could if it wanted just grow on its own revenues.Growing slower might be slightly dangerous, but chances are itwouldn\\'t kill them.  Whereas VCs need to invest in startups, andin particular the most successful startups, or they\\'ll be out ofbusiness.  Which means that any sufficiently promising startup willbe offered money on terms they\\'d be crazy to refuse.  And yet becauseof the scale of the successes in the startup business, VCs can stillmake money from such investments.  You\\'d have to be crazy to believeyour company was going to become as valuable as a high growth ratecan make it, but some do.Pretty much every successful startup will get acquisition offerstoo.  Why?  What is it about startups that makes other companieswant to buy them?Fundamentally the same thing that makes everyone else want the stockof successful startups: a rapidly growing company is valuable.  It\\'sa good thing eBay bought Paypal, for example, because Paypal is nowresponsible for 43% of their sales and probably more of their growth.But acquirers have an additional reason to want startups.  A rapidlygrowing company is not merely valuable, but dangerous.  If it keepsexpanding, it might expand into the acquirer\\'s own territory.  Mostproduct acquisitions have some component of fear.  Even if anacquirer isn\\'t threatened by the startup itself, they might bealarmed at the thought of what a competitor could do with it.  Andbecause startups are in this sense doubly valuable to acquirers,acquirers will often pay more than an ordinary investor would.UnderstandThe combination of founders, investors, and acquirers forms a naturalecosystem.  It works so well that those who don\\'t understand it aredriven to invent conspiracy theories to explain how neatly thingssometimes turn out.  Just as our ancestors did to explain theapparently too neat workings of the natural world.  But there isno secret cabal making it all work.If you start from the mistaken assumption that Instagram wasworthless, you have to invent a secret boss to force Mark Zuckerbergto buy it.  To anyone who knows Mark Zuckerberg, that is the reductioad absurdum of the initial assumption.  The reason he bought Instagramwas that it was valuable and dangerous, and what made it so wasgrowth.If you want to understand startups, understand growth.  Growthdrives everything in this world.  Growth is why startups usuallywork on technology — because ideas for fast growing companies areso rare that the best way to find new ones is to discover thoserecently made viable by change, and technology is the best sourceof rapid change.  Growth is why it\\'s a rational choice economicallyfor so many founders to try starting a startup: growth makes thesuccessful companies so valuable that the expected value is higheven though the risk is too.  Growth is why VCs want to invest instartups: not just because the returns are high but also becausegenerating returns from capital gains is easier to manage thangenerating returns from dividends.  Growth explains why the mostsuccessful startups take VC money even if they don\\'t need to: itlets them choose their growth rate.  And growth explains whysuccessful startups almost invariably get acquisition offers.  Toacquirers a fast-growing company is not merely valuable but dangeroustoo.It\\'s not just that if you want to succeed in some domain, you haveto understand the forces driving it.  Understanding growth is whatstarting a startupconsistsof.  What you\\'re really doing (andto the dismay of some observers, all you\\'re really doing) when youstart a startup is committing to solve a harder type of problemthan ordinary businesses do.  You\\'re committing to search for oneof the rare ideas that generates rapid growth.  Because these ideasare so valuable, finding one is hard.  The startup is the embodimentof your discoveries so far.  Starting a startup is thus very muchlike deciding to be a research scientist: you\\'re not committing tosolve any specific problem; you don\\'t know for sure which problemsare soluble; but you\\'re committing to try to discover something noone knew before.  A startup founder is in effect an economic researchscientist.  Most don\\'t discover anything that remarkable, but somediscover relativity.'},\n",

Inthe rest of the world, people don\\'t start things till they\\'re surewhat they want to do, and once started they tend to continue on theirinitial path even if it\\'s mistaken.3. How little money it can take to start a startup.In Kate\\'sworld, everything is still physical and expensive.  You can barelyrenovate a bathroom for the cost of starting a startup.4. How scrappy founders are.That was her actual word.  I agreewith her, but till she mentioned this it never occurred to me howlittle this quality is appreciated in most of the rest of the world.It wouldn\\'t be a compliment in most organizations to call someonescrappy.What does it mean, exactly?  It\\'s basically the diminutive form ofbelligerent.  Someone who\\'s scrappy manages to be both threateningand undignified at the same time.   Which seems to me exactly whatone would want to be, in any kind of work.  If you\\'re not threatening,you\\'re probably not doing anything new, and dignity is merely asort of plaque.5. How tech-saturated Silicon Valley is.\"It seems like everybodyhere is in the industry.\"  That isn\\'t literally true, but there isa qualitative difference between Silicon Valley and other places.You tend to keep your voice down, because there\\'s a good chance theperson at the next table would know some of the people you\\'re talkingabout.  I never felt that in Boston.  The good news is, there\\'salso a good chance the person at the next table could help you insome way.6. That the speakers at YC were so consistent in their advice.Actually, I\\'ve noticed this too.  I always worry the speakers willput us in an embarrassing position by contradicting what we tell thestartups, but it happens surprisingly rarely.When I asked her what specific things she remembered speakers alwayssaying, she mentioned: that the way to succeed was to launch somethingfast, listen to users, and then iterate; that startups requiredresilience because they were always an emotional rollercoaster; andthat most VCs were sheep.I\\'ve been impressed by how consistently the speakers advocatelaunching fast and iterating.  That was contrarian advice 10 yearsago, but it\\'s clearly now the established practice.7. How casual successful startup founders are.Most of the famousfounders in Silicon Valley are people you\\'d overlook on the street.It\\'s not merely that they don\\'t dress up.  They don\\'t project anykind of aura of power either.  \"They\\'re not trying to impressanyone.\"Interestingly, while Kate said that she could never pick outsuccessful founders, she could recognize VCs, both by the way theydressed and the way they carried themselves.8. How important it is for founders to have people to ask for advice.(I swear I didn\\'t prompt this one.)  Without advice \"they\\'d justbe sort of lost.\"  Fortunately, there are a lot of people to helpthem.  There\\'s a strong tradition within YC of helping other YC-fundedstartups.  But we didn\\'t invent that idea: it\\'s just a slightlymore concentrated form of existing Valley culture.9. What a solitary task startups are.Architects are constantlyinteracting face to face with other people, whereas doing a technologystartup, at least, tends to require long stretches of uninterruptedtime to work.  \"You could do it in a box.\"By inverting this list, we can get a portrait of the \"normal\" world.It\\'s populated by people who talk a lot with one another as theywork slowly but harmoniously on conservative, expensive projectswhose destinations are decided in advance, and who carefully adjusttheir manner to reflect their position in the hierarchy.That\\'s also a fairly accurate description of the past.  So startupculture may not merely be different in the way you\\'d expect anysubculture to be, but a leading indicator.Japanese Translation'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Corporate Development, aka corp dev, is the group within companiesthat buys other companies. If you\\'re talking to someone from corpdev, that\\'s why, whether you realize it yet or not.It\\'s usually a mistake to talk to corp dev unless (a) you want tosell your company right now and (b) you\\'re sufficiently likely toget an offer at an acceptable price.  In practice that means startupsshould only talk to corp dev when they\\'re either doing really wellor really badly.  If you\\'re doing really badly, meaning the companyis about to die, you may as well talk to them, because you havenothing to lose. And if you\\'re doing really well, you can safelytalk to them, because you both know the price will have to be high,and if they show the slightest sign of wasting your time, you\\'llbe confident enough to tell them to get lost.The danger is to companies in the middle.  Particularly to youngcompanies that are growing fast, but haven\\'t been doing it for longenough to have grown big yet.  It\\'s usually a mistake for a promisingcompany less than a year old even to talk to corp dev.But it\\'s a mistake founders constantly make.  When someone fromcorp dev wants to meet, the founders tell themselves they shouldat least find out what they want.  Besides, they don\\'t want tooffend Big Company by refusing to meet.Well, I\\'ll tell you what they want.  They want to talk about buyingyou.  That\\'s what the title \"corp dev\" means.   So before agreeingto meet with someone from corp dev, ask yourselves, \"Do we want tosell the company right now?\"  And if the answer is no, tell them\"Sorry, but we\\'re focusing on growing the company.\"  They won\\'t beoffended.  And certainly the founders of Big Company won\\'t beoffended. If anything they\\'ll think more highly of you.  You\\'llremind them of themselves.  They didn\\'t sell either; that\\'s whythey\\'re in a position now to buy other companies.Most founders who get contacted by corp dev already know what itmeans.  And yet even when they know what corp dev does and knowthey don\\'t want to sell, they take the meeting.  Why do they do it?The same mix of denial and wishful thinking that underlies mostmistakes founders make. It\\'s flattering to talk to someone who wantsto buy you.  And who knows, maybe their offer will be surprisinglyhigh.  You should at least see what it is, right?No.  If they were going to send you an offer immediately by email,sure, you might as well open it.  But that is not how conversationswith corp dev work.  If you get an offer at all, it will be at theend of a long and unbelievably distracting process.  And if theoffer is surprising, it will be surprisingly low.Distractions are the thing you can least afford in a startup.  Andconversations with corp dev are the worst sort of distraction,because as well as consuming yourattentionthey undermine yourmorale.  One of the tricks to surviving a grueling process is notto stop and think how tired you are.  Instead you get into a sortof flow.Imagine what it would do to you if at mile 20 of amarathon, someone ran up beside you and said \"You must feel reallytired.  Would you like to stop and take a rest?\"  Conversationswith corp dev are like that but worse, because the suggestion ofstopping gets combined in your mind with the imaginary high priceyou think they\\'ll offer.And then you\\'re really in trouble.  If they can, corp dev peoplelike to turn the tables on you. They like to get you to the pointwhere you\\'re trying to convince them to buy instead of them tryingto convince you to sell.  And surprisingly often they succeed.This is a very slippery slope, greased with some of the most powerfulforces that can work on founders\\' minds, and attended by an experiencedprofessional whose full time job is to push you down it.Their tactics in pushing you down that slope are usually fairlybrutal. Corp dev people\\'s whole job is to buy companies, and theydon\\'t even get to choose which.  The only way their performance ismeasured is by how cheaply they can buy you, and the more ambitiousones will stop at nothing to achieve that. For example, they\\'llalmost always start with a lowball offer, just to see if you\\'lltake it. Even if you don\\'t, a low initial offer will demoralize youand make you easier to manipulate.And that is the most innocent of their tactics. Just wait tillyou\\'ve agreed on a price and think you have a done deal, and thenthey come back and say their boss has vetoed the deal and won\\'t doit for more than half the agreed upon price. Happens all the time.If you think investors can behave badly, it\\'s nothing compared towhat corp dev people can do.  Even corp dev people at companiesthat are otherwise benevolent.I remember once complaining to afriend at Google about some nasty trick their corp dev people hadpulled on a YC startup.\"What happened to Don\\'t be Evil?\" I asked.\"I don\\'t think corp dev got the memo,\" he replied.The tactics you encounter in M&A conversations can be like nothingyou\\'ve experienced in the otherwise comparativelyupstandingworldof Silicon Valley.  It\\'s as if a chunk of genetic material from theold-fashioned robber baron business world got incorporated into thestartup world.The simplest way to protect yourself is to use the trick that JohnD. Rockefeller, whose grandfather was an alcoholic, used to protecthimself from becoming one.  He once told a Sunday school classBoys, do you know why I never became a drunkard?  Because I never  took the first drink.Do you want to sell your company right now?  Not eventually, rightnow.  If not, just don\\'t take the first meeting.  They won\\'t beoffended.  And you in turn will be guaranteed to be spared one ofthe worst experiences that can happen to a startup.If you do want to sell, there\\'s another set oftechniquesfor doingthat.  But the biggest mistake founders make in dealing with corpdev is not doing a bad job of talking to them when they\\'re readyto, but talking to them before they are.  So if you remember onlythe title of this essay, you already know most of what you need toknow about M&A in the first year.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.October 2014(This essay is derived from a guest lecture in Sam Altman\\'sstartup classatStanford.  It\\'s intended for college students, but much of it isapplicable to potential founders at other ages.)One of the advantages of having kids is that when you have to giveadvice, you can ask yourself \"what would I tell my own kids?\"  Mykids are little, but I can imagine what I\\'d tell them about startupsif they were in college, and that\\'s what I\\'m going to tell you.Startups are very counterintuitive.  I\\'m not sure why.  Maybe it\\'sjust because knowledge about them hasn\\'t permeated our culture yet.But whatever the reason, starting a startup is a task where youcan\\'t always trust your instincts.It\\'s like skiing in that way.  When you first try skiing and youwant to slow down, your instinct is to lean back.  But if you leanback on skis you fly down the hill out of control.  So part oflearning to ski is learning to suppress that impulse.  Eventuallyyou get new habits, but at first it takes a conscious effort.  Atfirst there\\'s a list of things you\\'re trying to remember as youstart down the hill.Startups are as unnatural as skiing, so there\\'s a similar list forstartups. Here I\\'m going to give you the first part of it — the thingsto remember if you want to prepare yourself to start a startup.CounterintuitiveThe first item on it is the fact I already mentioned: that startupsare so weird that if you trust your instincts, you\\'ll make a lotof mistakes.  If you know nothing more than this, you may at leastpause before making them.When I was running Y Combinator I used to joke that our functionwas to tell founders things they would ignore.  It\\'s really true.Batch after batch, the YC partners warn founders about mistakesthey\\'re about to make, and the founders ignore them, and then comeback a year later and say \"I wish we\\'d listened.\"Why do the founders ignore the partners\\' advice?  Well, that\\'s thething about counterintuitive ideas: they contradict your intuitions.They seem wrong.  So of course your first impulse is to disregardthem.  And in fact my joking description is not merely the curseof Y Combinator but part of its raison d\\'etre. If founders\\' instinctsalready gave them the right answers, they wouldn\\'t need us.  Youonly need other people to give you advice that surprises you. That\\'swhy there are a lot of ski instructors and not many runninginstructors.You can, however, trust your instincts about people.  And in factone of the most common mistakes young founders make is not todo that enough.  They get involved with people who seem impressive,but about whom they feel some misgivings personally.  Later whenthings blow up they say \"I knew there was something off about him,but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive.\"If you\\'re thinking about getting involved with someone — as acofounder, an employee, an investor, or an acquirer — and youhave misgivings about them, trust your gut.  If someone seemsslippery, or bogus, or a jerk, don\\'t ignore it.This is one case where it pays to be self-indulgent. Work withpeople you genuinely like, and you\\'ve known long enough to be sure.ExpertiseThe second counterintuitive point is that it\\'s not that importantto know a lot about startups.  The way to succeed in a startup isnot to be an expert on startups, but to be an expert on your usersand the problem you\\'re solving for them.Mark Zuckerberg didn\\'t succeed because he was an expert on startups.He succeeded despite being a complete noob at startups, because heunderstood his users really well.If you don\\'t know anything about, say, how to raise an angel round,don\\'t feel bad on that account.  That sort of thing you can learnwhen you need to, and forget after you\\'ve done it.In fact, I worry it\\'s not merely unnecessary to learn in greatdetail about the mechanics of startups, but possibly somewhatdangerous.  If I met an undergrad who knew all about convertiblenotes and employee agreements and (God forbid) class FF stock, Iwouldn\\'t think \"here is someone who is way ahead of their peers.\"It would set off alarms.  Because another of the characteristicmistakes of young founders is to go through the motions of startinga startup.  They make up some plausible-sounding idea, raise moneyat a good valuation, rent a cool office, hire a bunch of people.From the outside that seems like what startups do.  But the nextstep after rent a cool office and hire a bunch of people is: graduallyrealize how completely fucked they are, because while imitating allthe outward forms of a startup they have neglected the one thingthat\\'s actually essential: making something people want.GameWe saw this happen so often that we made up a name for it: playinghouse.  Eventually I realized why it was happening.  The reasonyoung founders go through the motions of starting a startup isbecause that\\'s what they\\'ve been trained to do for their whole livesup to that point.  Think about what you have to do to get intocollege, for example.  Extracurricular activities, check.  Even incollege classes most of the work is as artificial as running laps.I\\'m not attacking the educational system for being this way. Therewill always be a certain amount of fakeness in the work you do whenyou\\'re being taught something, and if you measure their performanceit\\'s inevitable that people will exploit the difference to the pointwhere much of what you\\'re measuring is artifacts of the fakeness.I confess I did it myself in college. I found that in a lot ofclasses there might only be 20 or 30 ideas that were the right shapeto make good exam questions.  The way I studied for exams in theseclasses was not (except incidentally) to master the material taughtin the class, but to make a list of potential exam questions andwork out the answers in advance. When I walked into the final, themain thing I\\'d be feeling was curiosity about which of my questionswould turn up on the exam.  It was like a game.It\\'s not surprising that after being trained for their whole livesto play such games, young founders\\' first impulse on starting astartup is to try to figure out the tricks for winning at this newgame. Since fundraising appears to be the measure of success forstartups (another classic noob mistake), they always want to know what thetricks are for convincing investors.  We tell them the best way toconvince investorsis to make a startupthat\\'s actually doing well, meaninggrowing fast, and then simplytell investors so.  Then they want to know what the tricks are forgrowing fast.  And we have to tell them the best way to do that issimply to make something people want.So many of the conversations YC partners have with young foundersbegin with the founder asking \"How do we...\" and the partner replying\"Just...\"Why do the founders always make things so complicated?  The reason,I realized, is that they\\'re looking for the trick.So this is the third counterintuitive thing to remember aboutstartups: starting a startup is where gaming the system stopsworking.  Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to workfor a big company. Depending on how broken the company is, you cansucceed by sucking up to the right people, giving the impressionof productivity, and so on.But that doesn\\'t work with startups.There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about iswhether your product does what they want. Startups are as impersonalas physics.  You have to make something people want, and you prosperonly to the extent you do.The dangerous thing is, faking does work to some degree on investors.If you\\'re super good at sounding like you know what you\\'re talkingabout, you can fool investors for at least one and perhaps even tworounds of funding.  But it\\'s not in your interest to.  The companyis ultimately doomed.  All you\\'re doing is wasting your own timeriding it down.So stop looking for the trick. There are tricks in startups, asthere are in any domain, but they are an order of magnitude lessimportant than solving the real problem. A founder who knows nothingabout fundraising but has made something users love will have aneasier time raising money than one who knows every trick in thebook but has a flat usage graph. And more importantly, the founderwho has made something users love is the one who will go on tosucceed after raising the money.Though in a sense it\\'s bad news in that you\\'re deprived of one ofyour most powerful weapons, I think it\\'s exciting that gaming thesystem stops working when you start a startup.  It\\'s exciting thatthere even exist parts of the world where you win by doing goodwork.  Imagine how depressing the world would be if it were alllike school and big companies, where you either have to spend a lotof time on bullshit things or lose to people who do.I wouldhave been delighted if I\\'d realized in college that there were partsof the real world where gaming the system mattered less than others,and a few where it hardly mattered at all.  But there are, and thisvariation is one of the most important things to consider whenyou\\'re thinking about your future.  How do you win in each type ofwork, and what would you like to win by doing?All-ConsumingThat brings us to our fourth counterintuitive point: startups areall-consuming.  If you start a startup, it will take over your lifeto a degree you cannot imagine.  And if your startup succeeds, itwill take over your life for a long time: for several years at thevery least, maybe for a decade, maybe for the rest of your workinglife.  So there is a real opportunity cost here.Larry Page may seem to have an enviable life, but there are aspectsof it that are unenviable.  Basically at 25 he started running asfast as he could and it must seem to him that he hasn\\'t stopped tocatch his breath since.  Every day new shit happens in the Googleempire that only the CEO can deal with, and he, as CEO, has to dealwith it.  If he goes on vacation for even a week, a whole week\\'sbacklog of shit accumulates.  And he has to bear this uncomplainingly,partly because as the company\\'s daddy he can never show fear orweakness, and partly because billionaires get less than zero sympathyif they talk about having difficult lives.  Which has the strangeside effect that the difficulty of being a successful startup founderis concealed from almost everyone except those who\\'ve done it.Y Combinator has now funded several companies that can be calledbig successes, and in every single case the founders say the samething.  It never gets any easier.  The nature of the problems change.You\\'re worrying about construction delays at your London officeinstead of the broken air conditioner in your studio apartment.But the total volume of worry never decreases; if anything itincreases.Starting a successful startup is similar to having kids in thatit\\'s like a button you push that changes your life irrevocably.And while it\\'s truly wonderful having kids, there are a lot ofthings that are easier to do before you have them than after.  Manyof which will make you a better parent when you do have kids. Andsince you can delay pushing the button for a while, most people inrich countries do.Yet when it comes to startups, a lot of people seem to think they\\'resupposed to start them while they\\'re still in college.  Are youcrazy?  And what are the universities thinking?  They go out oftheir way to ensure their students are well supplied with contraceptives,and yet they\\'re setting up entrepreneurship programs and startupincubators left and right.To be fair, the universities have their hand forced here.  A lotof incoming students are interested in startups.  Universities are,at least de facto, expected to prepare them for their careers.  Sostudents who want to start startups hope universities can teachthem about startups.  And whether universities can do this or not,there\\'s some pressure to claim they can, lest they lose applicantsto other universities that do.Can universities teach students about startups?  Yes and no.  Theycan teach students about startups, but as I explained before, thisis not what you need to know.  What you need to learn about are theneeds of your own users, and you can\\'t do that until you actuallystart the company.So starting a startup is intrinsicallysomething you can only really learn by doing it.  And it\\'s impossibleto do that in college, for the reason I just explained: startupstake over your life.  You can\\'t start a startup for real as astudent, because if you start a startup for real you\\'re not a studentanymore. You may be nominally a student for a bit, but you won\\'t evenbe that for long.Given this dichotomy, which of the two paths should you take?  Bea real student and not start a startup, or start a real startup andnot be a student?  I can answer that one for you. Do not start astartup in college.  How to start a startup is just a subset of abigger problem you\\'re trying to solve: how to have a good life.And though starting a startup can be part of a good life for a lotof ambitious people, age 20 is not the optimal time to do it.Starting a startup is like a brutally fast depth-first search.  Mostpeople should still be searching breadth-first at 20.You can do things in your early 20s that you can\\'t do as well beforeor after, like plunge deeply into projects on a whim and travelsuper cheaply with no sense of a deadline.  For unambitious people,this sort of thing is the dreaded \"failure to launch,\" but for theambitious ones it can be an incomparably valuable sort of exploration.If you start a startup at 20 and you\\'re sufficiently successful,you\\'ll never get to do it.Mark Zuckerberg will never get to bum around a foreign country.  Hecan do other things most people can\\'t, like charter jets to fly himto foreign countries. But success has taken a lot of the serendipityout of his life. Facebook is running him as much as he\\'s runningFacebook. And while it can be very cool to be in the grip of aproject you consider your life\\'s work, there are advantages toserendipity too, especially early in life.  Among other things itgives you more options to choose your life\\'s work from.There\\'s not even a tradeoff here. You\\'re not sacrificing anythingif you forgo starting a startup at 20, because you\\'re more likelyto succeed if you wait.  In the unlikely case that you\\'re 20 andone of your side projects takes off like Facebook did, you\\'ll facea choice of running with it or not, and it may be reasonable to runwith it.  But the usual way startups take off is for the founderstomake themtake off, and it\\'s gratuitouslystupid to do that at 20.TryShould you do it at any age?  I realize I\\'ve made startups soundpretty hard.  If I haven\\'t, let me try again: starting a startupis really hard.  What if it\\'s too hard?  How can you tell if you\\'reup to this challenge?The answer is the fifth counterintuitive point: you can\\'t tell. Yourlife so far may have given you some idea what your prospects mightbe if you tried to become a mathematician, or a professional footballplayer.  But unless you\\'ve had a very strange life you haven\\'t donemuch that waslikebeing a startup founder.Starting a startup will change you a lot.  So what you\\'re tryingto estimate is not just what you are, but what you could grow into,and who can do that?For the past 9 years it was my job to predict whether people wouldhave what it took to start successful startups.  It was easy totell how smart they were, and most people reading this will be overthat threshold.  The hard part was predicting howtough and ambitiousthey would become.  Theremay be no one who has more experience at trying to predict that,so I can tell you how much an expert can know about it, and theanswer is: not much.  I learned to keep a completely open mind aboutwhich of the startups in each batch would turn out to be the stars.The founders sometimes think they know. Some arrive feeling surethey will ace Y Combinator just as they\\'ve aced every one of the (few,artificial, easy) tests they\\'ve faced in life so far.  Others arrivewondering how they got in, and hoping YC doesn\\'t discover whatevermistake caused it to accept them.  But there is little correlationbetween founders\\' initial attitudes and how well their companiesdo.I\\'ve read that the same is true in the military — that theswaggering recruits are no more likely to turn out to be reallytough than the quiet ones. And probably for the same reason: thatthe tests involved are so different from the ones in their previouslives.If you\\'re absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probablyshouldn\\'t do it.  But if you\\'re merely unsure whether you\\'re up toit, the only way to find out is to try.  Just not now.IdeasSo if you want to start a startup one day, what should you do incollege?  There are only two things you need initially: an idea andcofounders.  And the m.o. for getting both is the same.  Which leadsto our sixth and last counterintuitive point: that the way to getstartup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas.I\\'ve written a wholeessayon this,so I won\\'t repeat it all here.  But the short version is that ifyou make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, the ideasyou come up with will not merely be bad, but bad and plausible-sounding,meaning you\\'ll waste a lot of time on them before realizing they\\'rebad.The way to come up with good startup ideas is to take a step back.Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas,turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without anyconscious effort.  In fact, so unconsciously that you don\\'t evenrealize at first that they\\'re startup ideas.This is not only possible, it\\'s how Apple, Yahoo, Google, andFacebook all got started.  None of these companies were even meantto be companies at first.  They were all just side projects.  Thebest startups almost have to start as side projects, because greatideas tend to be such outliers that your conscious mind would rejectthem as ideas for companies.Ok, so how do you turn your mind into the type that startup ideasform in unconsciously?  (1) Learn a lot about things that matter,then (2) work on problems that interest you (3) with people youlike and respect.  The third part, incidentally, is how you getcofounders at the same time as the idea.The first time I wrote that paragraph, instead of \"learn a lot aboutthings that matter,\" I wrote \"become good at some technology.\" Butthat prescription, though sufficient, is too narrow.  What wasspecial about Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia was not that they wereexperts in technology.  They were good at design, and perhaps evenmore importantly, they were good at organizing groups and makingprojects happen.  So you don\\'t have to work on technology per se,so long as you work on problems demanding enough to stretch you.What kind of problems are those?  That is very hard to answer inthe general case.  History is full of examples of young people whowere working on important problems thatnoone elseat the time thought were important, and in particularthat their parents didn\\'t think were important.  On the other hand,history is even fuller of examples of parents who thought theirkids were wasting their time and who were right.  So how do youknow when you\\'re working on real stuff?I know howIknow.  Real problems are interesting, and I amself-indulgent in the sense that I always want to work on interestingthings, even if no one else cares about them (in fact, especiallyif no one else cares about them), and find it very hard to makemyself work on boring things, even if they\\'re supposed to beimportant.My life is full of case after case where I worked on something justbecause it seemed interesting, and it turned out later to be usefulin some worldly way.YCombinator itselfwas something I only did because it seemedinteresting. So I seem to have some sort of internal compass thathelps me out.  But I don\\'t know what other people have in theirheads. Maybe if I think more about this I can come up with heuristicsfor recognizing genuinely interesting problems, but for the momentthe best I can offer is the hopelessly question-begging advice thatif you have a taste for genuinely interesting problems, indulgingit energetically is the best way to prepare yourself for a startup.And indeed, probably also the best way to live.But although I can\\'t explain in the general case what counts as aninteresting problem, I can tell you about a large subset of them.If you think of technology as something that\\'s spreading like asort of fractal stain, every moving point on the edge representsan interesting problem.  So one guaranteed way to turn your mindinto the type that has good startup ideas is to get yourself to theleading edge of some technology — to cause yourself, as PaulBuchheit put it, to \"live in the future.\" When you reach that point,ideas that will seem to other people uncannily prescient will seemobvious to you.  You may not realize they\\'re startup ideas, butyou\\'ll know they\\'re something that ought to exist.For example, back at Harvard in the mid 90s a fellow grad studentof my friends Robert and Trevor wrote his own voice over IP software.He didn\\'t mean it to be a startup, and he never tried to turn itinto one.  He just wanted to talk to his girlfriend in Taiwan withoutpaying for long distance calls, and since he was an expert onnetworks it seemed obvious to him that the way to do it was turnthe sound into packets and ship it over the Internet. He never didany more with his software than talk to his girlfriend, but thisis exactly the way the best startups get started.So strangely enough the optimal thing to do in college if you wantto be a successful startup founder is not some sort of new, vocationalversion of college focused on \"entrepreneurship.\" It\\'s the classicversion of college as education for its own sake. If you want tostart a startup after college, what you should do in college islearn powerful things.  And if you have genuine intellectualcuriosity, that\\'s what you\\'ll naturally tend to do if you justfollow your own inclinations.The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domainexpertise.  The way to become Larry Page was to become an experton search. And the way to become an expert on search was to bedriven by genuine curiosity, not some ulterior motive.At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive forcuriosity.  And you\\'ll do it best if you introduce the ulteriormotive toward the end of the process.So here is the ultimate advice for young would-be startup founders,boiled down to two words: just learn.'},\n",

To be a successful scientist, forexample, it\\'s not enough just to be correct. Your ideas have to beboth correct and novel. You can\\'t publish papers saying things otherpeople already know. You need to say things no one else has realizedyet.The same is true for investors. It\\'s not enough for a public marketinvestor to predict correctly how a company will do. If a lot ofother people make the same prediction, the stock price will alreadyreflect it, and there\\'s no room to make money. The only valuableinsights are the ones most other investors don\\'t share.You see this pattern with startup founders too. You don\\'t want tostart a startup to do something that everyone agrees is a good idea,or there will already be other companies doing it. You have to dosomething that sounds to most other people like a bad idea, butthat you know isn\\'t — like writing software for a tiny computerused by a few thousand hobbyists, or starting a site to let peoplerent airbeds on strangers\\' floors.Ditto for essayists. An essay that told people things they alreadyknew would be boring. You have to tell them somethingnew.But this pattern isn\\'t universal. In fact, it doesn\\'t hold for mostkinds of work. In most kinds of work — to be an administrator, forexample — all you need is the first half. All you need is to beright. It\\'s not essential that everyone else be wrong.There\\'s room for a little novelty in most kinds of work, but inpractice there\\'s a fairly sharp distinction between the kinds ofwork where it\\'s essential to be independent-minded, and the kindswhere it\\'s not.I wish someone had told me about this distinction when I was a kid,because it\\'s one of the most important things to think about whenyou\\'re deciding what kind of work you want to do. Do you want todo the kind of work where you can only win by thinking differentlyfrom everyone else? I suspect most people\\'s unconscious mind willanswer that question before their conscious mind has a chance to.I know mine does.Independent-mindedness seems to be more a matter of nature thannurture. Which means if you pick the wrong type of work, you\\'regoing to be unhappy. If you\\'re naturally independent-minded, you\\'regoing to find it frustrating to be a middle manager. And if you\\'renaturally conventional-minded, you\\'re going to be sailing into aheadwind if you try to do original research.One difficulty here, though, is that people are often mistaken aboutwhere they fall on the spectrum from conventional- to independent-minded.Conventional-minded people don\\'t like to think of themselves asconventional-minded. And in any case, it genuinely feels to themas if they make up their own minds about everything. It\\'s just acoincidence that their beliefs are identical to their peers\\'. Andthe independent-minded, meanwhile, are often unaware how differenttheir ideas are from conventional ones, at least till they statethem publicly.By the time they reach adulthood, most people know roughly how smartthey are (in the narrow sense of ability to solve pre-set problems),because they\\'re constantly being tested and ranked according to it.But schools generally ignore independent-mindedness, except to theextent they try to suppress it. So we don\\'t get anything like thesame kind of feedback about how independent-minded we are.There may even be a phenomenon like Dunning-Kruger at work, wherethe most conventional-minded people are confident that they\\'reindependent-minded, while the genuinely independent-minded worrythey might not be independent-minded enough.___________Can you make yourself more independent-minded? I think so. Thisquality may be largely inborn, but there seem to be ways to magnifyit, or at least not to suppress it.One of the most effective techniques is one practiced unintentionallyby most nerds: simply to be less aware what conventional beliefsare. It\\'s hard to be a conformist if you don\\'t know what you\\'resupposed to conform to. Though again, it may be that such peoplealready are independent-minded. A conventional-minded person wouldprobably feel anxious not knowing what other people thought, andmake more effort to find out.It matters a lot who you surround yourself with. If you\\'re surroundedby conventional-minded people, it will constrain which ideas youcan express, and that in turn will constrain which ideas you have.But if you surround yourself with independent-minded people, you\\'llhave the opposite experience: hearing other people say surprisingthings will encourage you to, and to think of more.Because the independent-minded find it uncomfortable to be surroundedby conventional-minded people, they tend to self-segregate oncethey have a chance to. The problem with high school is that theyhaven\\'t yet had a chance to. Plus high school tends to be aninward-looking little world whose inhabitants lack confidence, bothof which magnify the forces of conformism.  So high school isoften abad timefor theindependent-minded. But there is some advantage even here: itteaches you what to avoid. If you later find yourself in a situationthat makes you think \"this is like high school,\" you know you shouldget out.Another place where the independent- and conventional-minded arethrown together is in successful startups. The founders and earlyemployees are almost always independent-minded; otherwise the startupwouldn\\'t be successful. But conventional-minded people greatlyoutnumber independent-minded ones, so as the company grows, theoriginal spirit of independent-mindedness is inevitably diluted.This causes all kinds of problems besides the obvious one that thecompany starts to suck. One of the strangest is that the foundersfind themselves able to speak more freely with founders of othercompanies than with their own employees.Fortunately you don\\'t have to spend all your time with independent-mindedpeople. It\\'s enough to have one or two you can talk to regularly.And once you find them, they\\'re usually as eager to talk as youare; they need you too. Although universities no longer have thekind of monopoly they used to have on education, good universitiesare still an excellent way to meet independent-minded people. Moststudents will still be conventional-minded, but you\\'ll at leastfind clumps of independent-minded ones, rather than the near zeroyou may have found in high school.It also works to go in the other direction: as well as cultivatinga small collection of independent-minded friends, to try to meetas many different types of people as you can. It will decrease theinfluence of your immediate peers if you have several other groupsof peers. Plus if you\\'re part of several different worlds, you canoften import ideas from one to another.But by different types of people, I don\\'t mean demographicallydifferent. For this technique to work, they have to think differently.So while it\\'s an excellent idea to go and visit other countries,you can probably find people who think differently right around thecorner. When I meet someone who knows a lot about something unusual(which includes practically everyone, if you dig deep enough), Itry to learn what they know that other people don\\'t. There arealmost always surprises here. It\\'s a good way to make conversationwhen you meet strangers, but I don\\'t do it to make conversation.I really want to know.You can expand the source of influences in time as well as space,by reading history. When I read history I do it not just to learnwhat happened, but to try to get inside the heads of people wholived in the past. How did things look to them? This is hard to do,but worth the effort for the same reason it\\'s worth travelling farto triangulate a point.You can also take more explicit measures to prevent yourself fromautomatically adopting conventional opinions. The most general isto cultivate an attitude of skepticism. When you hear someone saysomething, stop and ask yourself \"Is that true?\" Don\\'t say it outloud. I\\'m not suggesting that you impose on everyone who talks toyou the burden of proving what they say, but rather that you takeupon yourself the burden of evaluating what they say.Treat it as a puzzle. You know that some accepted ideas will laterturn out to be wrong. See if you can guess which. The end goal isnot to find flaws in the things you\\'re told, but to find the newideas that had been concealed by the broken ones. So this gameshould be an exciting quest for novelty, not a boring protocol forintellectual hygiene. And you\\'ll be surprised, when you start asking\"Is this true?\", how often the answer is not an immediate yes. Ifyou have any imagination, you\\'re more likely to have too many leadsto follow than too few.More generally your goal should be not to let anything into yourhead unexamined, and things don\\'t always enter your head in theform of statements. Some of the most powerful influences are implicit.How do you even notice these? By standing back and watching howother people get their ideas.When you stand back at a sufficient distance, you can see ideasspreading through groups of people like waves. The most obvious arein fashion: you notice a few people wearing a certain kind of shirt,and then more and more, until half the people around you are wearingthe same shirt. You may not care much what you wear, but there areintellectual fashions too, and you definitely don\\'t want to participatein those. Not just because you want sovereignty over your ownthoughts, but becauseunfashionableideas are disproportionately likely to lead somewhere interesting.The best place to find undiscovered ideas is where no one else islooking.___________To go beyond this general advice, we need to look at the internalstructure of independent-mindedness — at the individual muscleswe need to exercise, as it were. It seems to me that it has threecomponents: fastidiousness about truth, resistance to being toldwhat to think, and curiosity.Fastidiousness about truth means more than just not believing thingsthat are false. It means being careful about degree of belief. Formost people, degree of belief rushes unexamined toward the extremes:the unlikely becomes impossible, and the probable becomes certain.To the independent-minded, this seems unpardonably sloppy.They\\'re willing to have anything in their heads, from highlyspeculative hypotheses to (apparent) tautologies, but on subjectsthey care about, everything has to be labelled with a carefullyconsidered degree of belief.The independent-minded thus have a horror of ideologies, whichrequire one to accept a whole collection of beliefs at once, andto treat them as articles of faith. To an independent-minded personthat would seem revolting, just as it would seem to someone fastidiousabout food to take a bite of a submarine sandwich filled with alarge variety of ingredients of indeterminate age and provenance.Without this fastidiousness about truth, you can\\'t be trulyindependent-minded. It\\'s not enough just to have resistance to beingtold what to think. Those kind of people reject conventional ideasonly to replace them with the most random conspiracy theories. Andsince these conspiracy theories have often been manufactured tocapture them, they end up being less independent-minded than ordinarypeople, because they\\'re subject to a much more exacting master thanmere convention.Can you increase your fastidiousness about truth? I would think so.In my experience, merely thinking about something you\\'re fastidiousabout causes that fastidiousness to grow. If so, this is one ofthose rare virtues we can have more of merely by wanting it. Andif it\\'s like other forms of fastidiousness, it should also bepossible to encourage in children. I certainly got a strong doseof it from my father.The second component of independent-mindedness, resistance to beingtold what to think, is the most visible of the three. But even thisis often misunderstood. The big mistake people make about it is tothink of it as a merely negative quality. The language we usereinforces that idea. You\\'reunconventional. Youdon\\'tcarewhat other people think. But it\\'s not just a kind of immunity. Inthe most independent-minded people, the desire not to be told whatto think is a positive force. It\\'s not mere skepticism, but anactivedelightin ideas that subvertthe conventional wisdom, the more counterintuitive the better.Some of the most novel ideas seemed at the time almost like practicaljokes. Think how often your reaction to a novel idea is to laugh.I don\\'t think it\\'s because novel ideas are funny per se, but becausenovelty and humor share a certain kind of surprisingness. But whilenot identical, the two are close enough that there is a definitecorrelation between having a sense of humor and being independent-minded— just as there is between being humorless and being conventional-minded.I don\\'t think we can significantly increase our resistance to beingtold what to think. It seems the most innate of the three componentsof independent-mindedness; people who have this quality as adultsusually showed all too visible signs of it as children. But if wecan\\'t increase our resistance to being told what to think, we canat least shore it up, by surrounding ourselves with otherindependent-minded people.The third component of independent-mindedness, curiosity, may bethe most interesting. To the extent that we can give a brief answerto the question of where novel ideas come from, it\\'s curiosity. That\\'swhat people are usually feeling before having them.In my experience, independent-mindedness and curiosity predict oneanother perfectly. Everyone I know who\\'s independent-minded isdeeply curious, and everyone I know who\\'s conventional-minded isn\\'t.Except, curiously, children. All small children are curious. Perhapsthe reason is that even the conventional-minded have to be curiousin the beginning, in order to learn what the conventions are. Whereasthe independent-minded are the gluttons of curiosity, who keepeating even after they\\'re full.The three components of independent-mindedness work in concert:fastidiousness about truth and resistance to being told what tothink leave space in your brain, and curiosity finds new ideas tofill it.Interestingly, the three components can substitute for one anotherin much the same way muscles can. If you\\'re sufficiently fastidiousabout truth, you don\\'t need to be as resistant to being told whatto think, because fastidiousness alone will create sufficient gapsin your knowledge. And either one can compensate for curiosity,because if you create enough space in your brain, your discomfortat the resulting vacuum will add force to your curiosity. Or curiositycan compensate for them: if you\\'re sufficiently curious, you don\\'tneed to clear space in your brain, because the new ideas you discoverwill push out the conventional ones you acquired by default.Because the components of independent-mindedness are so interchangeable,you can have them to varying degrees and still get the same result.So there is not just a single model of independent-mindedness. Someindependent-minded people are openly subversive, and others arequietly curious. They all know the secret handshake though.Is there a way to cultivate curiosity? To start with, you want toavoid situations that suppress it. How much does the work you\\'recurrently doing engage your curiosity? If the answer is \"not much,\"maybe you should change something.The most important active step you can take to cultivate yourcuriosity is probably to seek out the topics that engage it. Fewadults are equally curious about everything, and it doesn\\'t seemas if you can choose which topics interest you. So it\\'s up to youtofindthem. Or invent them, ifnecessary.Another way to increase your curiosity is to indulge it, byinvestigating things you\\'re interested in. Curiosity is unlikemost other appetites in this respect: indulging it tends to increaserather than to sate it. Questions lead to more questions.Curiosity seems to be more individual than fastidiousness abouttruth or resistance to being told what to think. To the degreepeople have the latter two, they\\'re usually pretty general, whereasdifferent people can be curious about very different things. Soperhaps curiosity is the compass here. Perhaps, if your goal is todiscover novel ideas, your motto should not be \"do what you love\"so much as \"do what you\\'re curious about.\"'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.August 2010When I went to work for Yahoo after they bought our startup in 1998,it felt like the center of the world.  It was supposed to be thenext big thing.  It was supposed to be what Google turned out tobe.What went wrong?  The problems that hosed Yahoo go back a long time,practically to the beginning of the company.  They were alreadyvery visible when I got there in 1998.  Yahoo had two problemsGoogle didn\\'t: easy money, and ambivalence about being a technologycompany.MoneyThe first time I met Jerry Yang, we thought we were meeting fordifferent reasons.  He thought we were meeting so he could checkus out in person before buying us. I thought we were meeting so wecould show him our new technology, Revenue Loop.   It was a way ofsorting shopping search results.  Merchants bid a percentage ofsales for traffic, but the results were sorted not by the bid butby the bid times the average amount a user would buy.  It waslike the algorithm Google uses now to sort ads, but this was in thespring of 1998, before Google was founded.Revenue Loop was the optimal sort for shopping search, in the sensethat it sorted in order of how much money Yahoo would make fromeach link.  But it wasn\\'t just optimal in that sense.  Rankingsearch results by user behavior also makes search better.  Userstrain the search: you can start out finding matches based on meretextual similarity, and as users buy more stuff the search resultsget better and better.Jerry didn\\'t seem to care.  I was confused.  I was showing himtechnology that extracted the maximum value from search traffic,and he didn\\'t care?  I couldn\\'t tell whether I was explaining itbadly, or he was just very poker faced.I didn\\'t realize the answer till later, after I went to work atYahoo.  It was neither of my guesses.  The reason Yahoo didn\\'t careabout a technique that extracted the full value of traffic was thatadvertisers were already overpaying for it.  If Yahoo merely extractedthe actual value, they\\'d have made less.Hard as it is to believe now, the big money then was in banner ads.Advertisers were willing to pay ridiculous amounts for banner ads.So Yahoo\\'s sales force had evolved to exploit this source of revenue.Led by a large and terrifyingly formidable man called Anil Singh,Yahoo\\'s sales guys would fly out to Procter & Gamble and come backwith million dollar orders for banner ad impressions.The prices seemed cheap compared to print, which was what advertisers,for lack of any other reference, compared them to.  But they wereexpensive compared to what they were worth.  So these big, dumbcompanies were a dangerous source of revenue to depend on.  Butthere was another source even more dangerous: other Internet startups.By 1998, Yahoo was the beneficiary of a de facto Ponzi scheme.Investors were excited about the Internet.  One reason they wereexcited was Yahoo\\'s revenue growth.  So they invested in new Internetstartups.  The startups then used the money to buy ads on Yahoo toget traffic.  Which caused yet more revenue growth for Yahoo, andfurther convinced investors the Internet was worth investing in.When I realized this one day, sitting in my cubicle, I jumped uplike Archimedes in his bathtub, except instead of \"Eureka!\" I wasshouting \"Sell!\"Both the Internet startups and the Procter & Gambles were doingbrand advertising.  They didn\\'t care about targeting.  They justwanted lots of people to see their ads.  So traffic became the thingto get at Yahoo.  It didn\\'t matter what type.It wasn\\'t just Yahoo.  All the search engines were doing it.  Thiswas why they were trying to get people to start calling them \"portals\"instead of \"search engines.\" Despite the actual meaning of the wordportal, what they meant by it was a site where users would findwhat they wanted on the site itself, instead of just passing throughon their way to other destinations, as they did at a search engine.I remember telling David Filo in late 1998 or early 1999 that Yahooshould buy Google, because I and most of the other programmers inthe company were using it instead of Yahoo for search.  He told methat it wasn\\'t worth worrying about.  Search was only 6% of ourtraffic, and we were growing at 10% a month.   It wasn\\'t worth doingbetter.I didn\\'t say \"But search traffic is worth more than other traffic!\"I said \"Oh, ok.\"  Because I didn\\'t realize either how much searchtraffic was worth.  I\\'m not sure even Larry and Sergey did then.If they had, Google presumably wouldn\\'t have expended any efforton enterprise search.If circumstances had been different, the people running Yahoo mighthave realized sooner how important search was.  But they had themost opaque obstacle in the world between them and the truth: money.As long as customers were writing big checks for banner ads, it washard to take search seriously.  Google didn\\'t have that to distractthem.HackersBut Yahoo also had another problem that made it hard to changedirections.  They\\'d been thrown off balance from the start by theirambivalence about being a technology company.One of the weirdest things about Yahoo when I went to work therewas the way they insisted on calling themselves a \"media company.\"If you walked around their offices, it seemed like a softwarecompany.  The cubicles were full of programmers writing code, productmanagers thinking about feature lists and ship dates, support people(yes, there were actually support people) telling users to restarttheir browsers, and so on, just like a software company.  So whydid they call themselves a media company?One reason was the way they made money: by selling ads.  In 1995it was hard to imagine a technology company making money that way.Technology companies made money by selling their software to users.Media companies sold ads.  So they must be a media company.Another big factor was the fear of Microsoft.   If anyone at Yahooconsidered the idea that they should be a technology company, thenext thought would have been that Microsoft would crush them.It\\'s hard for anyone much younger than me to understand the fearMicrosoft still inspired in 1995.  Imagine a company with severaltimes the power Google has now, but way meaner.  It was perfectlyreasonable to be afraid of them.  Yahoo watched them crush the firsthot Internet company, Netscape.  It was reasonable to worry thatif they tried to be the next Netscape, they\\'d suffer the same fate.How were they to know that Netscape would turn out to be Microsoft\\'slast victim?It would have been a clever move to pretend to be a media companyto throw Microsoft off their scent.  But unfortunately Yahoo actuallytried to be one, sort of.  Project managers at Yahoo were called\"producers,\" for example, and the different parts of the companywere called \"properties.\" But what Yahoo really needed to be was atechnology company, and by trying to be something else, they endedup being something that was neither here nor there.  That\\'s whyYahoo as a company has never had a sharply defined identity.The worst consequence of trying to be a media company was that theydidn\\'t take programming seriously enough.  Microsoft (back in theday), Google, and Facebook have all had hacker-centric cultures.But Yahoo treated programming as a commodity.  At Yahoo, user-facing softwarewas controlled by product managers and designers.  The job ofprogrammers was just to take the work of the product managers anddesigners the final step, by translating it into code.One obvious result of this practice was that when Yahoo built things,they often weren\\'t very good. But that wasn\\'t the worst problem.The worst problem was that they hired bad programmers.Microsoft (back in the day), Google, and Facebook have all beenobsessed with hiring the best programmers.  Yahoo wasn\\'t.  Theypreferred good programmers to bad ones, but they didn\\'t have thekind of single-minded, almost obnoxiously elitist focus on hiringthe smartest people that the big winners have had.  And when youconsider how much competition there was for programmers when theywere hiring, during the Bubble, it\\'s not surprising that the qualityof their programmers was uneven.In technology, once you have bad programmers, you\\'re doomed.  Ican\\'t think of an instance where a company has sunk into technicalmediocrity and recovered. Good programmers want to work with othergood programmers.  So once the quality of programmers at your companystarts to drop, you enter a death spiral from which there is norecovery.At Yahoo this death spiral started early.  If there was ever a time whenYahoo was a Google-style talent magnet, it was over by the time Igot there in 1998.The company felt prematurely old.  Most technology companieseventually get taken over by suits and middle managers.  At Yahooit felt as if they\\'d deliberately accelerated this process.  Theydidn\\'t want to be a bunch of hackers.  They wanted to be suits.  Amedia company should be run by suits.The first time I visited Google, they had about 500 people, thesame number Yahoo had when I went to work there.  But boy did thingsseem different.  It was still very much a hacker-centric culture.I remember talking to some programmers in the cafeteria about theproblem of gaming search results (now known as SEO), and they asked\"what should we do?\"  Programmers at Yahoo wouldn\\'t have asked that.Theirs was not to reason why; theirs was to build what productmanagers spec\\'d.  I remember coming away from Google thinking \"Wow,it\\'s still a startup.\"There\\'s not much we can learn from Yahoo\\'s first fatal flaw. It\\'sprobably too much to hope any company could avoid being damaged bydepending on a bogus source of revenue.  But startups can learn animportant lesson from the second one.  In the software business,you can\\'t afford not to have a hacker-centric culture.Probably the most impressive commitment I\\'ve heard to having ahacker-centric culture came from Mark Zuckerberg, when he spoke atStartup School in 2007.  He said that in the early days Facebookmade a point of hiring programmers even for jobs that would notordinarily consist of programming, like HR and marketing.So which companies need to have a hacker-centric culture?  Whichcompanies are \"in the software business\" in this respect?  As Yahoodiscovered, the area covered by this rule is bigger than most peoplerealize.  The answer is: any company that needs to have good software.Why would great programmers want to work for a company that didn\\'thave a hacker-centric culture, as long as there were others thatdid?  I can imagine two reasons: if they were paid a huge amount,or if the domain was interesting and none of the companies in itwere hacker-centric.  Otherwise you can\\'t attract good programmersto work in a suit-centric culture.  And without good programmersyou won\\'t get good software, no matter how many people you put ona task, or how many procedures you establish to ensure \"quality.\"Hacker cultureoften seems kind of irresponsible.  That\\'s why peopleproposing to destroy it use phrases like \"adult supervision.\" Thatwas the phrase they used at Yahoo.  But there are worse things thanseeming irresponsible.  Losing, for example.'},\n",

       "  'date': 'December 2005',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'The most impressive people I know are all terrible procrastinators.So could it be that procrastination isn\\'t always bad?Most people who write about procrastination write about how to cureit.  But this is, strictly speaking, impossible.  There are aninfinite number of things you could be doing.  No matter what youwork on, you\\'re not working on everything else.  So the questionis not how to avoid procrastination, but how to procrastinate well.There are three variants of procrastination, depending on what youdo instead of working on something: you could work on (a) nothing,(b) something less important, or (c) something more important.  Thatlast type, I\\'d argue, is good procrastination.That\\'s the \"absent-minded professor,\" who forgets to shave, or eat,or even perhaps look where he\\'s going while he\\'s thinking aboutsome interesting question.   His mind is absent from the everydayworld because it\\'s hard at work in another.That\\'s the sense in which the most impressive people I know are allprocrastinators.  They\\'re type-C procrastinators:  they put offworking on small stuff to work on big stuff.What\\'s \"small stuff?\"  Roughly, work that has zero chance of beingmentioned in your obituary.  It\\'s hard to say at the time what willturn out to be your best work (will it be your magnum opus onSumerian temple architecture, or the detective thriller you wroteunder a pseudonym?), but there\\'s a whole class of tasks you cansafely rule out: shaving, doing your laundry, cleaning the house,writing thank-you notes—anything that might be called an errand.Good procrastination is avoiding errands to do real work.Good in a sense, at least.  The people who want you to do the errandswon\\'t think it\\'s good.  But you probably have to annoy them if youwant to get anything done.  The mildest seeming people, if theywant to do real work, all have a certain degree of ruthlessnesswhen it comes to avoiding errands.Some errands, like replying to letters, go away if youignore them (perhaps taking friends with them).  Others, like mowingthe lawn, or filing tax returns, only get worse if you put themoff.  In principle it shouldn\\'t work to put off the second kind oferrand.  You\\'re going to have to do whatever it is eventually.  Whynot (as past-due notices are always saying) do it now?The reason it pays to put off even those errands is that real workneeds two things errands don\\'t: big chunks of time, and theright mood.  If you get inspired by some project, it can be a netwin to blow off everything you were supposed to do for the next fewdays to work on it.  Yes, those errands may cost you more time whenyou finally get around to them.  But if you get a lot done duringthose few days, you will be net more productive.In fact, it may not be a difference in degree, but a difference inkind.  There may be types of work that can only be done in long,uninterrupted stretches, when inspiration hits, rather than dutifullyin scheduled little slices.  Empirically it seems to be so.  WhenI think of the people I know who\\'ve done great things, I don\\'timagine them dutifully crossing items off to-do lists.  I imaginethem sneaking off to work on some new idea.Conversely, forcing someone to perform errands synchronously isbound to limit their productivity.  The cost of an interruption isnot just the time it takes, but that it breaks the time on eitherside in half.  You probably only have to interrupt someone a coupletimes a day before they\\'re unable to work on hard problems at all.I\\'ve wondered a lot about whystartupsare most productive at thevery beginning, when they\\'re just a couple guys in an apartment.The main reason may be that there\\'s no one to interrupt them yet.In theory it\\'s good when the founders finally get enough money tohire people to do some of the work for them.  But it may be betterto be overworked than interrupted.  Once you dilute a startup withordinary office workers—with type-B procrastinators—the wholecompany starts to resonate at their frequency.  They\\'re interrupt-driven,and soon you are too.Errands are so effective at killing great projects that a lot ofpeople use them for that purpose.  Someone who has decided to writea novel, for example, will suddenly find that the house needscleaning. People who fail to write novels don\\'t do it by sittingin front of a blank page for days without writing anything.  Theydo it by feeding the cat, going out to buy something they need fortheir apartment, meeting a friend for coffee, checking email.  \"Idon\\'t have time to work,\" they say.  And they don\\'t; they\\'ve madesure of that.(There\\'s also a variant where one has no place to work.  The cureis to visit the places where famous people worked, and see howunsuitable they were.)I\\'ve used both these excuses at one time or another.  I\\'ve learneda lot of tricks for making myself work over the last 20 years, buteven now I don\\'t win consistently.  Some days I get real work done.Other days are eaten up by errands.  And I know it\\'s usually myfault: Ileterrands eat up the day, to avoidfacing some hard problem.The most dangerous form of procrastination is unacknowledged type-Bprocrastination, because it doesn\\'t feel like procrastination.You\\'re \"getting things done.\"  Just the wrong things.Any advice about procrastination that concentrates on crossingthings off your to-do list is not only incomplete, but positivelymisleading, if it doesn\\'t consider the possibility that the to-dolist is itself a form of type-B procrastination.  In fact, possibilityis too weak a word.  Nearly everyone\\'s is.  Unless you\\'re workingon the biggest things you could be working on, you\\'re type-Bprocrastinating, no matter how much you\\'re getting done.In his famous essayYou and Your Research(which I recommend toanyone ambitious, no matter what they\\'re working on), Richard Hammingsuggests that you ask yourself three questions:What are the most important problems in your field?Are you working on one of them?Why not?Hamming was at Bell Labs when he started asking such questions.  Inprinciple anyone there ought to have been able to work on the mostimportant problems in their field.  Perhaps not everyone can makean equally dramatic mark on the world; I don\\'t know; but whateveryour capacities, there are projects that stretch them.  So Hamming\\'sexercise can be generalized to:What\\'s the best thing you could be working on, and why aren\\'t  you?Most people will shy away from this question.  I shy away from itmyself; I see it there on the page and quickly move on to the nextsentence.  Hamming used to go around actually asking people this,and it didn\\'t make him popular.  But it\\'s a question anyone ambitiousshould face.The trouble is, you may end up hooking a very big fish with thisbait.  To do good work, you need to do more than find good projects.Once you\\'ve found them, you have to get yourself to work on them,and that can be hard.  The bigger the problem, the harder it is toget yourself to work on it.Of course, the main reason people find it difficult to work on aparticular problem is that they don\\'tenjoyit.  When you\\'re young,especially, you often find yourself working on stuff you don\\'treally like-- because it seems impressive, for example, or becauseyou\\'ve been assigned to work on it.  Most grad students are stuckworking on big problems they don\\'t really like, and grad school isthus synonymous with procrastination.But even when you like what you\\'re working on, it\\'s easier to getyourself to work on small problems than big ones.  Why?  Why is itso hard to work on big problems?  One reason is that you may notget any reward in the forseeable future.  If you work on somethingyou can finish in a day or two, you can expect to have a nice feelingof accomplishment fairly soon.  If the reward is indefinitely farin the future, it seems less real.Another reason people don\\'t work on big projects is, ironically,fear of wasting time.  What if they fail?  Then all the time theyspent on it will be wasted.  (In fact it probably won\\'t be, becausework on hard projects almost always leads somewhere.)But the trouble with big problems can\\'t be just that they promiseno immediate reward and might cause you to waste a lot of time.  Ifthat were all, they\\'d be no worse than going to visit your in-laws.There\\'s more to it than that.  Big problems areterrifying.There\\'s an almost physical pain in facing them.  It\\'s like havinga vacuum cleaner hooked up to your imagination.   All your initialideas get sucked out immediately, and you don\\'t have any more, andyet the vacuum cleaner is still sucking.You can\\'t look a big problem too directly in the eye. You have toapproach it somewhat obliquely.  But you have to adjust the anglejust right: you have to be facing the big problem directly enoughthat you catch some of the excitement radiating from it, but notso much that it paralyzes you.  You can tighten the angle once youget going, just as a sailboat can sail closer to the wind once itgets underway.If you want to work on big things, you seem to have to trick yourselfinto doing it.  You have to work on small things that could growinto big things, or work on successively larger things, or splitthe moral load with collaborators.  It\\'s not a sign of weakness todepend on such tricks.  The very best work has been done this way.When I talk to people who\\'ve managed to make themselves work on bigthings, I find that all blow off errands, and all feel guilty aboutit.  I don\\'t think they should feel guilty.  There\\'s more to dothan anyone could.  So someone doing the best work they can isinevitably going to leave a lot of errands undone.  It seems amistake to feel bad about that.I think the way to \"solve\" the problem of procrastination is to letdelight pull you instead of making a to-do list push you.  Work onan ambitious project you really enjoy, and sail as close to thewind as you can, and you\\'ll leave the right things undone.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.October 2008The economic situation is apparently so grim that some experts fearwe may be in for a stretch as bad as the mid seventies.When Microsoft and Apple were founded.As those examples suggest, a recession may not be such a bad timeto start a startup.  I\\'m not claiming it\\'s a particularly good timeeither.  The truth is more boring: the state of the economy doesn\\'tmatter much either way.If we\\'ve learned one thing from funding so many startups, it\\'s thatthey succeed or fail based on the qualities of the founders.  Theeconomy has some effect, certainly, but as a predictor of successit\\'s rounding error compared to the founders.Which means that what matters is who you are, not when you do it.If you\\'re the right sort of person, you\\'ll win even in a bad economy.And if you\\'re not, a good economy won\\'t save you.  Someone whothinks \"I better not start a startup now, because the economy isso bad\" is making the same mistake as the people who thought duringthe Bubble \"all I have to do is start a startup, and I\\'ll be rich.\"So if you want to improve your chances, you should think far moreabout who you can recruit as a cofounder than the state of theeconomy.  And if you\\'re worried about threats to the survival ofyour company, don\\'t look for them in the news.  Look in the mirror.But for any given team of founders, would it not pay to wait tillthe economy is better before taking the leap?  If you\\'re startinga restaurant, maybe, but not if you\\'re working on technology.Technology progresses more or less independently of the stock market.So for any given idea, the payoff for acting fast in a bad economywill be higher than for waiting.  Microsoft\\'s first product was aBasic interpreter for the Altair.  That was exactly what the worldneeded in 1975, but if Gates and Allen had decided to wait a fewyears, it would have been too late.Of course, the idea you have now won\\'t be the last you have.  Thereare always new ideas.  But if you have a specific idea you want toact on, act now.That doesn\\'t mean you can ignore the economy.  Both customers and investorswill be feeling pinched.  It\\'s not necessarily a problem if customersfeel pinched: you may even be able to benefit from it, by makingthings thatsave money.  Startups often make things cheaper, so inthat respect they\\'re better positioned to prosper in a recessionthan big companies.Investors are more of a problem.  Startups generally need to raisesome amount of external funding, and investors tend to be lesswilling to invest in bad times.  They shouldn\\'t be.  Everyone knowsyou\\'re supposed to buy when times are bad and sell when times aregood.  But of course what makes investing so counterintuitive isthat in equity markets, good times are defined as everyone thinkingit\\'s time to buy.  You have to be a contrarian to be correct, andby definition only a minority of investors can be.So just as investors in 1999 were tripping over one another tryingto buy into lousy startups, investors in 2009 will presumably bereluctant to invest even in good ones.You\\'ll have to adapt to this.  But that\\'s nothing new: startupsalways have to adapt to the whims of investors.  Ask any founderin any economy if they\\'d describe investors as fickle, and watchthe face they make.  Last year you had to be prepared to explainhow your startup was viral.  Next year you\\'ll have to explain howit\\'s recession-proof.(Those are both good things to be.  The mistake investors make isnot the criteria they use but that they always tend to focus on oneto the exclusion of the rest.)Fortunately the way to make a startup recession-proof is to doexactly what you should do anyway: run it as cheaply as possible.For years I\\'ve been telling founders that the surest route to successis to be the cockroaches of the corporate world.  The immediatecause of death in a startup is always running out of money. So thecheaper your company is to operate, the harder it is to kill.And fortunately it has gotten very cheap to run a startup. A recessionwill if anything make it cheaper still.If nuclear winter really is here, it may be safer to be a cockroacheven than to keep your job.  Customers may drop off individuallyif they can no longer afford you, but you\\'re not going to lose themall at once; markets don\\'t \"reduce headcount.\"What if you quit your job to start a startup that fails, and youcan\\'t find another?  That could be a problem if you work in sales ormarketing.  In those fields it can take months to find a newjob in a bad economy.  But hackers seem to be more liquid.  Goodhackers can always get some kind of job.  It might not be your dreamjob, but you\\'re not going to starve.Another advantage of bad times is that there\\'s less competition.Technology trains leave the station at regular intervals.  If everyone else is cowering in a corner, you may have a whole car toyourself.You\\'re an investor too.  As a founder, you\\'re buying stock withwork: the reason Larry and Sergey are so rich is not so much thatthey\\'ve done work worth tens of billions of dollars, but that theywere the first investors in Google.  And like any investor youshould buy when times are bad.Were you nodding in agreement, thinking \"stupid investors\" a fewparagraphs ago when I was talking about how investors are reluctantto put money into startups in bad markets, even though that\\'s thetime they should rationally be most willing to buy?  Well, foundersaren\\'t much better.  When times get bad, hackers go to grad school.And no doubt that will happen this time too.  In fact, what makesthe preceding paragraph true is that most readers won\\'t believeit—at least to the extent of acting on it.So maybe a recession is a good time to start a startup.  It\\'s hardto say whether advantages like lack of competition outweighdisadvantages like reluctant investors.  But it doesn\\'t matter mucheither way.   It\\'s the people that matter.  And for a given set ofpeople working on a given technology, the time to act is alwaysnow.Russian TranslationChinese TranslationJapanese Translation'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'The fiery reaction to the release ofArchadan unexpected consequence: it made me realize I had a designphilosophy.  The main complaint of the more articulate critics wasthat Arc seemed so flimsy. After years of working on it, all I hadto show for myself were a few thousand lines of macros?  Why hadn\\'tI worked on more substantial problems?As I was mulling over these remarks it struck me how familiar theyseemed.  This was exactly the kind of thing people said at firstabout Viaweb, and Y Combinator, and most of my essays.When we launched Viaweb, it seemed laughable to VCs and e-commerce\"experts.\"  We were just a couple guys in an apartment,which did not seem cool in 1995 the way it does now.  And the thingwe\\'d built, as far as they could tell, wasn\\'t even software.Software, to them, equalled big, honking Windows apps.  Since Viawebwas the firstweb-basedapp they\\'d seen, it seemed to be nothingmore than a website.  They were even more contemptuous when theydiscovered that Viaweb didn\\'t process credit card transactions (wedidn\\'t for the whole first year).  Transaction processing seemedto them what e-commerce was all about.  It sounded serious anddifficult.And yet, mysteriously, Viaweb ended up crushing all its competitors.The initial reaction toY Combinatorwas almost identical.  Itseemed laughably lightweight.  Startup funding meant series A rounds:millions of dollars given to a small number of startups founded bypeople with established credentials after months of serious,businesslike meetings, on terms described in a document a footthick.  Y Combinator seemed inconsequential.  It\\'s too early to sayyet whether Y Combinator will turn out like Viaweb, but judgingfrom the number of imitations, a lot of people seem to think we\\'reon to something.I can\\'t measure whether my essays are successful, except in pageviews, but the reaction to them is at least different from when Istarted.  At first the default reaction of the Slashdot trolls was(translated into articulate terms): \"Who is this guy and whatauthority does he have to write about these topics?  I haven\\'t readthe essay, but there\\'s no way anything so short and written in suchan informal style could have anything useful to say about such andsuch topic, when people with degrees in the subject have alreadywritten many thick books about it.\" Now there\\'s a new generationof trolls on a new generation of sites, but they have at leaststarted to omit the initial \"Who is this guy?\"Now people are saying the same things about Arc that they said atfirst about Viaweb and Y Combinator and most of my essays.  Why thepattern?  The answer, I realized, is that my m.o. for all four hasbeen the same.Here it is: I like to find (a) simple solutions (b) to overlookedproblems (c) that actually need to be solved, and (d) deliver themas informally as possible, (e) starting with a very crude version1, then (f) iterating rapidly.When I first laid out these principles explicitly, I noticed somethingstriking: this is practically a recipe for generating a contemptuousinitial reaction.  Though simple solutions are better, they don\\'tseem as impressive as complex ones.  Overlooked problems are bydefinition problems that most people think don\\'t matter.  Deliveringsolutions in an informal way means that instead of judging somethingby the way it\\'s presented, people have to actually understand it,which is more work.  And starting with a crude version 1 means yourinitial effort is always small and incomplete.I\\'d noticed, of course, that people never seemed to grasp new ideasat first.  I thought it was just because most people were stupid.Now I see there\\'s more to it than that.Like acontrarian investment fund, someone following this strategy willalmost always be doing things that seem wrong to the average person.As with contrarian investment strategies, that\\'s exactly the point.This technique is successful (in the long term) because it gives youall the advantages other people forgo by trying to seem legit.  Ifyou work on overlooked problems, you\\'re more likely to discover newthings, because you have less competition.  If you deliver solutionsinformally, you (a) save all the effort you would have had to expendto make them look impressive, and (b) avoid the danger of foolingyourself as well as your audience.  And if you release a crudeversion 1 then iterate, your solution can benefit from the imaginationof nature, which, as Feynman pointed out, is more powerful thanyour own.In the case of Viaweb, the simple solution was to make the softwarerun on the server.  The overlooked problem was to generate web sitesautomatically; in 1995, online stores were all made by hand by humandesigners, but we knew this wouldn\\'t scale.  The part that actuallymattered was graphic design, not transaction processing.The informal delivery mechanism was me, showing up in jeans and at-shirt at some retailer\\'s office.  And the crude version 1 was,if I remember correctly, less than 10,000 lines of code when welaunched.The power of this technique extends beyond startups and programminglanguages and essays.  It probably extends to any kind of creativework.  Certainly it can be used in painting: this is exactly what Cezanne and Klee did.At Y Combinator we bet money on it, in the sense that we encouragethe startups we fund to work this way. There are always new ideasright under your nose.  So look for simple things that other peoplehave overlooked—things people will later claim were \"obvious\"—especially when they\\'ve been led astray by obsolete conventions,or by trying to do things that are superficially impressive.  Figureout what the real problem is, and make sure you solve that.  Don\\'tworry about trying to look corporate; the product is what wins inthe long term.  And launch as soon as you can, so you start learningfrom users what you should have been making.Redditis a classic example of this approach.  When Reddit firstlaunched, it seemed like there was nothing to it.  To the graphicallyunsophisticated its deliberately minimal design seemed like nodesign at all.  But Reddit solved the real problem, which was totell people what was new and otherwise stay out of the way.  As aresult it became massively successful.  Now that conventional ideashave caught up with it, it seems obvious.  People look at Redditand think the founders were lucky.  Like all such things, it washarder than it looked.  The Reddits pushed so hard against thecurrent that they reversed it; now it looks like they\\'re merelyfloating downstream.So when you look at something like Reddit and think \"I wish I couldthink of an idea like that,\" remember: ideas like that are allaround you.  But you ignore them because they look wrong.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'A couple months ago I got an email from a recruiter asking if I wasinterested in being a \"technologist in residence\" at a new venturecapital fund.  I think the idea was to play Karl Rove to the VCs\\'George Bush.I considered it for about four seconds.  Work for a VC fund?  Ick.One of my most vivid memories from our startup is going to visitGreylock, the famous Boston VCs. They were the most arrogantpeople I\\'ve met in my life.  And I\\'ve met a lot of arrogant people.[1]I\\'m not alone in feeling this way, of course.  Even a VC friend ofmine dislikes VCs.  \"Assholes,\" he says.But lately I\\'ve been learning more about how the VC world works,and a few days ago it hit me that there\\'s a reason VCs are the waythey are.  It\\'s not so much that the business attracts jerks, oreven that the power they wield corrupts them.  The real problem isthe way they\\'re paid.The problem with VC funds is that they\\'refunds.  Like themanagers of mutual funds or hedge funds, VCs get paid a percentageof the money they manage: about 2% a year in management fees,plus a percentage of the gains.  So they wantthe fund to be huge-- hundreds of millions of dollars, if possible.But that means each partner ends up being responsible for investinga lot of money.  And since one person can only manage so many deals,each deal has to be for multiple millions of dollars.This turns out to explain nearly all the characteristics of VCsthat founders hate.It explains why VCs take so agonizingly long to make up their minds,and why their due diligence feels like a body cavity search. [2]With so much at stake, they have to be paranoid.It explains why they steal your ideas.  Every founder knows thatVCs will tell your secrets to your competitors if they end upinvesting in them.  It\\'s not unheard of for VCs to meet you whenthey have no intention of funding you, just to pick your brain fora competitor.  This prospect makes naive founders clumsily secretive.Experienced founders treat it as a cost of doing business.  Eitherway it sucks.  But again, the only reason VCs are so sneaky is thegiant deals they do.  With so much at stake, they have to be devious.It explains why VCs tend to interfere in the companies they investin.  They want to be on your board not just so that they can adviseyou, but so that they can watch you.  Often they even install a newCEO.  Yes, he may have extensive business experience.  But he\\'salso their man: these newly installed CEOs always play something  of the role of a political commissar in a Red Army unit.  Withso much at stake, VCs can\\'t resist micromanaging you.The huge investments themselves are something founders would dislike,if they realized how damaging they can be.  VCs don\\'t invest $xmillion because that\\'s the amount you need, but because that\\'s theamount the structure of their business requires them to invest.  Like steroids, these sudden huge investments can do more harm than good.  Google survived enormous VC funding because it couldlegitimately absorb large amounts of money.  They had to buy a lotof servers and a lot of bandwidth to crawl the whole Web.  Lessfortunate startups just end up hiring armies of people to sit aroundhaving meetings.In principle you could take a huge VC investment, put it in treasurybills, and continue to operate frugally.  You just try it.And of course giant investments mean giant valuations.  They haveto, or there\\'s not enough stock left to keep the founders interested.You might think a high valuation is a great thing.  Many founders do.  But you can\\'t eat paper.  You can\\'t benefit from a high valuationunless you can somehow achieve what those in the businesscall a \"liquidity event,\" and the higher   your valuation, the narrower your options for doing that.  Many a   founder would be happy to sell his company for $15 million, but VCswho\\'ve just invested at a pre-money valuation of $8 million won\\'thear of that.  You\\'re rolling the dice again, whether you like itor not.Back in 1997, one of our competitors raised $20 million in a single round of VC funding.  This was at the time more than the valuationof our entire company.  Was I worried?  Not at all: I was delighted.It was like watching a car you\\'re chasing turn down a street thatyou know has no outlet.Their smartest move at that point would have been to take every penny of the $20 million and use it to buy us.  We would have sold.Their investors would have been furious of course.  But I think the  main reason they never considered this was that they never imaginedwe could be had so cheap.  They probably assumed we were on thesame VC gravy train they were.In fact we only spent about $2 million in our entire existence.   And that gave us flexibility.  We could sell ourselves to Yahoo for$50 million, and everyone was delighted.  If our competitor haddone that, the last round of investors would presumably have lostmoney.  I assume they could have vetoed such a deal.  But no one  those days was paying a lot more than Yahoo.  So unless theirfounders could pull off an IPO (which would be difficult with Yahooas a competitor), they had no choice but to ride the thing down.The puffed-up companies that went public during the Bubble didn\\'tdo it just because they were pulled into it by unscrupulous investment bankers.  Most were pushed just as hard from the other side by VCswho\\'d invested at high valuations, leaving an IPO as the only way  out.  The only people dumber were retail investors.  So it wasliterally IPO or bust.  Or rather, IPO then bust, or just bust.Add up all the evidence of VCs\\' behavior, and the resulting personalityis not attractive.  In fact, it\\'s the classic villain: alternatelycowardly, greedy, sneaky, and overbearing.I used to take it for granted that VCs were like this. Complaining  that VCs were jerks used to seem as naive to me as complaining thatusers didn\\'t read the reference manual.  Of course VCs were jerks.How could it be otherwise?But I realize now that they\\'re not intrinsically jerks.  VCs are  like car salesmen or bureaucrats: the nature of their workturns them into jerks.I\\'ve met a few VCs I like.  Mike Moritz seems a good guy.  He even has a sense of humor, which is almost unheard of among VCs.  From  what I\\'ve read about John Doerr, he sounds like a good guy too,  almost a hacker.  But they work for the very best VC funds.  And my theory explains why they\\'d tend to be different: just as thevery most popular kids don\\'t have to persecutenerds, the very bestVCs don\\'t have to act like VCs.  They get the pick of all the best  deals.  So they don\\'t have to be so paranoid and sneaky, and they can choose those rare companies, like Google, that will actuallybenefit from the giant sums they\\'re compelled to invest.VCs often complain that in their business there\\'s too much moneychasing too few deals.  Few realize that this also describes a flawin the way funding works at the level of individual firms.Perhaps this was the sort of strategic insight I was supposed to   come up with as a \"technologist in residence.\"  If so, the goodnews is that they\\'re getting it for free.  The bad news is itmeans that if you\\'re not one of the very top funds, you\\'re condemned to be the bad guys.'},\n",

       "  'date': 'Want to start a startup?',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.March 2005(This essay is derived from a talk at the Harvard ComputerSociety.)You need three things to create a successful startup: to start withgood people, to make something customers actually want, and to spendas little money as possible.  Most startups that fail do it becausethey fail at one of these.  A startup that does all three willprobably succeed.And that\\'s kind of exciting, when you think about it, because allthree are doable.  Hard, but doable.  And since a startup thatsucceeds ordinarily makes its founders rich, that implies gettingrich is doable too.  Hard, but doable.If there is one message I\\'d like to get across about startups,that\\'s it.  There is no magically difficult step that requiresbrilliance to solve.The IdeaIn particular, you don\\'t need a brilliantideato start a startuparound.   The way a startup makes money is to offer people bettertechnology than they have now.  But what people have now is oftenso bad that it doesn\\'t take brilliance to do better.Google\\'s plan, for example, was simply to create a search site thatdidn\\'t suck.  They had three new ideas: index more of the Web, uselinks to rank search results, and have clean, simple web pages withunintrusive keyword-based ads.  Above all, they were determined tomake a site that was good to use.  No doubt there are great technicaltricks within Google, but the overall plan was straightforward.And while they probably have bigger ambitions now, this alone bringsthem a billion dollars a year. [1]There are plenty of other areas that are just as backward as searchwas before Google.  I can think of several heuristics for generatingideas for startups, but most reduce to this: look at somethingpeople are trying to do, and figure out how to do it in a way thatdoesn\\'t suck.For example, dating sites currently suck far worse than search didbefore Google.  They all use the same simple-minded model.They seem to have approached the problem by thinking about how todo database matches instead of how dating works in the real world.An undergrad could build something better as a class project.  Andyet there\\'s a lot of money at stake.  Online dating is a valuablebusiness now, and it might be worth a hundred times as much if itworked.An idea for a startup, however, is only a beginning.  A lot ofwould-be startup founders think the key to the whole process is theinitial idea, and from that point all you have to do is execute.Venture capitalists know better.  If you go to VC firms with abrilliant idea that you\\'ll tell them about if they sign a nondisclosureagreement, most will tell you to get lost.   That shows how much a mere idea is worth. The market price is less than the inconvenience of signing an NDA.Another sign of how little the initial idea is worth is the numberof startups that change their plan en route. Microsoft\\'s originalplan was to make money selling programming languages, of all things.Their current business model didn\\'t occur to them until IBM droppedit in their lap five years later.Ideas for startups are worth something, certainly, but the troubleis, they\\'re not transferrable.  They\\'re not something you couldhand to someone else to execute.  Their value is mainly as startingpoints: as questions for the people who had them to continue thinkingabout.What matters is not ideas, but the people who have them.  Goodpeople can fix bad ideas, but good ideas can\\'t save bad people.PeopleWhat do I mean by good people?  One of the best tricks I learned   duringourstartup was a rule for deciding who to hire.  Could youdescribe the person as an animal?  It might be hard to translate   that into another language, but I think everyone in the US knows  what it means.  It means someone who takes their work a little too   seriously; someone who does what they do so well that they passright through professional and cross over into obsessive.What it means specifically depends on the job: a salesperson whojust won\\'t take no for an answer; a hacker who will stay up till   4:00 AM rather than go to bed leaving code with a bug in it; a PR   person who will cold-callNew York Timesreporters on their cellphones; a graphic designer who feels physical pain when something is two millimeters out of place.Almost everyone who worked for us was an animal at what they did. The woman in charge of sales was so tenacious that I used to feelsorry for potential customers on the phone with her.  You could  sense them squirming on the hook, but you knew there would be no  rest for them till they\\'d signed up.If you think about people you know, you\\'ll find the animal test iseasy to apply.  Call the person\\'s image to mind and imagine thesentence \"so-and-so is an animal.\"  If you laugh, they\\'re not.  Youdon\\'t need or perhaps even want this quality in big companies, butyou need it in a startup.For programmers we had three additional tests.  Was the persongenuinely smart?  If so, could they actually get things done?  Andfinally, since a few good hackers have unbearable personalities,   could we stand to have them around?That last test filters out surprisingly few people.  We could bearany amount of nerdiness if someone was truly smart.  What we couldn\\'tstand were people with a lot of attitude.  But most of those weren\\'ttruly smart, so our third test was largely a restatement of thefirst.When nerds are unbearable it\\'s usually because they\\'re trying toohard to seem smart.  But the smarter they are, the less pressurethey feel to act smart.  So as a rule you can recognize genuinelysmart people by their ability to say things like \"I don\\'t know,\"   \"Maybe you\\'re right,\" and \"I don\\'t understand x well enough.\"This technique doesn\\'t always work, because people can be influencedby their environment.  In the MIT CS department, there seems to bea tradition of acting like a brusque know-it-all. I\\'m told it derivesultimately from Marvin Minsky, in the same way the classic airlinepilot manner is said to derive from Chuck Yeager.  Even genuinelysmart people start to act this way there, so you have to makeallowances.It helped us to have Robert Morris, who is one of the readiest tosay \"I don\\'t know\" of anyone I\\'ve met.  (At least, he was before he became a professor at MIT.)  No one dared put on attitude around   Robert, because he was obviously smarter than they were and yet hadzero attitude himself.Like most startups, ours began with a group of friends, and it wasthrough personal contacts that we got most of the people we hired.This is a crucial difference between startups and big companies.Being friends with someone for even a couple days will tell you more than companies could ever learn in interviews.  [2]It\\'s no coincidence that startups start around universities, becausethat\\'s where smart people meet.  It\\'s not what people learn in    classes at MIT and Stanford that has made technology companiesspring up around them.  They could sing campfire songs in the classesso long as admissions worked the same.If you start a startup, there\\'s a good chance it will be with peopleyou know from college or grad school.  So in theory you ought to  try to make friends with as many smart people as you can in school,right?  Well, no.  Don\\'t make a conscious effort to schmooze; thatdoesn\\'t work well with hackers.What you should do in college is work on your own projects.  Hackersshould do this even if they don\\'t plan to start startups, because it\\'s the only real way to learn how to program.   In some cases youmay collaborate with other students, and this is the best way toget to know good hackers.  The project may even grow into a startup.But once again, I wouldn\\'t aim too directly at either target.  Don\\'tforce things; just work on stuff you like with people you like.Ideally you want between two and four founders.  It would be hardto start with just one.  One person would find the moral weight ofstarting a company hard to bear.  Even Bill Gates, who seems to be   able to bear a good deal of moral weight, had to have a co-founder. But you don\\'t want so many founders that the company starts to looklike a group photo.  Partly because you don\\'t need a lot of peopleat first, but mainly because the more founders you have, the worsedisagreements you\\'ll have. When there are just two or three founders,you know you have to resolve disputes immediately or perish.  Ifthere are seven or eight, disagreements can linger and harden intofactions.  You don\\'t want mere voting; you need unanimity.In a technology startup, which most startups are, the foundersshould include technical people.   During the Internet Bubble there were a number of startups founded by business people who then wentlooking for hackers to create their product for them.  This doesn\\'t  work well.  Business people are bad at deciding what to do with   technology, because they don\\'t know what the options are, or whichkinds of problems are hard and which are easy.  And when businesspeople try to hire hackers, they can\\'t tell which ones aregood.Even other hackers have a hard time doing that. For business people it\\'s roulette.Do the founders of a startup have to include business people?  Thatdepends.  We thought so when we started ours, and we asked several people who were said to know about this mysterious thing called\"business\" if they would be the president.  But they all said no,so I had to do it myself.  And what I discovered was that businesswas no great mystery.   It\\'s not something like physics or medicinethat requires extensive study.  You just try to get people to payyou for stuff.I think the reason I made such a mystery of business was that I wasdisgusted by the idea of doing it.  I wanted to work in the pure,   intellectual world of software, not deal with customers\\' mundane  problems.  People who don\\'t want to get dragged into some kind ofwork often develop a protective incompetence at it.  Paul Erdos wasparticularly good at this.  By seeming unable even to cut a grapefruitin half (let alone go to the store and buy one), he forced otherpeople to do such things for him, leaving all his time free formath.  Erdos was an extreme case, but most husbands use the same  trick to some degree.Once I was forced to discard my protective incompetence, I foundthat business was neither so hard nor so boring as I feared.  Thereare esoteric areas of business that are quite hard, like tax lawor the pricing of derivatives, but you don\\'t need to know about   those in a startup.  All you need to know about business to run a  startup are commonsense things people knew before there were businessschools, or even universities.If you work your way down the Forbes 400 making an x next to the   name of each person with an MBA, you\\'ll learn something importantabout business school.  After Warren Buffett, you don\\'t hit another MBA till number 22,Phil Knight, the CEO of Nike.  There are only 5 MBAs in the top50.  What you notice in the Forbes 400 are a lot of people with      technical backgrounds.  Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison,Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, Gordon Moore.  The rulers of the technologybusiness tend to come from technology, not business.  So if you   want to invest two years in something that will help you succeed  in business, the evidence suggests you\\'d do better to learn how to   hack than get an MBA. [3]There is one reason you might want to include business people in astartup, though: because you have to have at least one person willingand able to focus on what customers want. Some believe only businesspeople can do this-- that hackers can implement software, but not   design it.  That\\'s nonsense.  There\\'s nothing about knowing how toprogram that prevents hackers from understanding users, or aboutnot knowing how to program that magically enables business people to understand them.If you can\\'t understand users, however, you should either learn howor find a co-founder who can.  That is the single most importantissue for technology startups, and the rock that sinks more of themthan anything else.What Customers WantIt\\'s not just startups that have to worry about this.  I think mostbusinesses that fail do it because they don\\'t give customers whatthey want.  Look at restaurants.  A large percentage fail, about aquarter in the first year.  But can you think of one restaurantthat had really good food and went out of business?Restaurants with great food seem to prosper no matter what.  A    restaurant with great food can be expensive, crowded, noisy, dingy,out of the way, and even have bad service, and people will keepcoming.  It\\'s true that a restaurant with mediocre food can sometimes attract customers through gimmicks.  But that approach is very  risky.  It\\'s more straightforward just to make the food good.It\\'s the same with technology.  You hear all kinds of reasons whystartups fail.  But can you think of one that had a massively popularproduct and still failed?In nearly every failed startup, the real problem was that customersdidn\\'t want the product.  For most, the cause of death is listed  as \"ran out of funding,\" but that\\'s only the immediate cause.  Why couldn\\'t they get more funding?  Probably because the product wasa dog, or never seemed likely to be done, or both.When I was trying to think of the things every startup needed to   do, I almost included a fourth: get a version 1 out as soon as youcan.  But I decided not to, because that\\'s implicit in makingsomething customers want.  The only way to make something customerswant is to get a prototype in front of them and refine it based on   their reactions.The other approach is what I call the \"Hail Mary\" strategy.  You  make elaborate plans for a product, hire a team of engineers to   develop it (people who do this tend to use the term \"engineer\" for   hackers), and then find after a year that you\\'ve spent two milliondollars to develop something no one wants.  This was not uncommonduring the Bubble, especially in companies run by business types, who thought of software development as something terrifying thattherefore had to be carefully planned.We never even considered that approach.  As a Lisp hacker, I come from the tradition of rapid prototyping.  I would not claim (atleast, not here) that this is the right way to write every program,but it\\'s certainly the right way to write software for a startup.In a startup, your initial plans are almost certain to be wrong insome way, and your first priority should be to figure out where.   The only way to do that is to try implementing them.Like most startups, we changed our plan on the fly.  At first weexpected our customers to be Web consultants.  But it turned outthey didn\\'t like us, because our software was easy to use and we hostedthe site.  It would be too easy for clients to fire them.  We alsothought we\\'d be able to sign up a lot of catalog companies, becauseselling online was a natural extension of their existing business.But in 1996 that was a hard sell.  The middle managers we talked   to at catalog companies saw the Web not as an opportunity, but assomething that meant more work for them.We did get a few of the more adventurous catalog companies.  Amongthem was Frederick\\'s of Hollywood, which gave us valuable experiencedealing with heavy loads on our servers.  But most of our users   were small, individual merchants who saw the Web as an opportunity to build a business.  Some had retail stores, but many only existedonline.  And so we changed direction to focus on these users.Instead of concentrating on the features Web consultants and catalogcompanies would want, we worked to make the software easy to use.I learned something valuable from that.  It\\'s worth trying very, very hard to make technology easy to use.  Hackers are so used tocomputers that they have no idea how horrifying software seems tonormal people.  Stephen Hawking\\'s editor told him that every equationhe included in his book would cut sales in half.  When you work onmaking technology easier to use, you\\'re riding that curve up instead  of down. A 10% improvement in ease of use doesn\\'t just increase    your sales 10%.  It\\'s more likely to double your sales.How do you figure out what customers want?  Watch them.  One of thebest places to do this was at trade shows.  Trade shows didn\\'t pay as a way of getting new customers, but they were worth it as marketresearch.  We didn\\'t just give canned presentations at trade shows.We used to show people how to build real, working stores.  Which   meant we got to watch as they used our software, and talk to them    about what they needed.No matter what kind of startup you start, it will probably be a   stretch for you, the founders, to understand what users want.  Theonly kind of software you can build without studying users is the    sort for which you are the typical user.  But this is just the kindthat tends to be open source: operating systems, programminglanguages, editors, and so on.  So if you\\'re developing technologyfor money, you\\'re probably not going to be developing it for peoplelike you.  Indeed, you can use this as a way to generate ideas forstartups: what do people who are not like you want from technology?When most people think of startups, they think of companies likeApple or Google.  Everyone knows these, because they\\'re big consumerbrands.  But for every startup like that, there are twenty more  that operate in niche markets or live quietly down in the infrastructure.So if you start a successful startup, odds are you\\'ll start one of those.Another way to say that is, if you try to start the kind of startupthat has to be a big consumer brand, the odds against succeedingare steeper.  The best odds are in niche markets.  Since startups  make money by offering people something better than they had before,the best opportunities are where things suck most.  And it would   be hard to find a place where things suck more than in corporate  IT departments.  You would not believe the amount of money companiesspend on software, and the crap they get in return.  This imbalanceequals opportunity.If you want ideas for startups, one of the most valuable things youcould do is find a middle-sized non-technology company and spend a  couple weeks just watching what they do with computers.  Most goodhackers have no more idea of the horrors perpetrated in these placesthan rich Americans do of what goes on in Brazilian slums.Start by writing software for smaller companies, because it\\'s easierto sell to them.  It\\'s worth so much to sell stuff to big companiesthat the people selling them the crap they currently use spend alot of time and money to do it.  And while you can outhack Oraclewith one frontal lobe tied behind your back, you can\\'t outsell anOracle salesman.  So if you want to win through better technology,aim at smaller customers.  [4]They\\'re the more strategically valuable part of the market anyway.    In technology, the low end always eats the high end.  It\\'s easier  to make an inexpensive product more powerful than to make a powerfulproduct cheaper.  So the products that start as cheap, simple optionstend to gradually grow more powerful till, like water rising in a  room, they squash the \"high-end\" products against the ceiling.  Sundid this to mainframes, and Intel is doing it to Sun.  MicrosoftWord did it to desktop publishing software like Interleaf andFramemaker.  Mass-market digital cameras are doing it to the expensivemodels made for professionals.  Avid did it to the manufacturers     of specialized video editing systems, and now Apple is doing it toAvid.Henry Forddid it to the car makers that precededhim.  If you build the simple, inexpensive option, you\\'ll not onlyfind it easier to sell at first, but you\\'ll also be in the best   position to conquer the rest of the market.It\\'s very dangerous to let anyone fly under you.  If you have thecheapest, easiest product, you\\'ll own the low end.  And if youdon\\'t, you\\'re in the crosshairs of whoever does.Raising MoneyTo make all this happen, you\\'re going to need money.  Some startupshave been self-funding-- Microsoft for example-- but most aren\\'t.I think it\\'s wise to take money from investors.  To be self-funding,you have to start as a consulting company, and it\\'s hard to switchfrom that to a product company.Financially, a startup is like a pass/fail course.  The way to getrich from a startup is to maximize the company\\'s chances of succeeding,not to maximize the amount of stock you retain.  So if you can tradestock for something that improves your odds, it\\'s probably a smart move.To most hackers, getting investors seems like a terrifying andmysterious process.  Actually it\\'s merely tedious.  I\\'ll try togive an outline of how it works.The first thing you\\'ll need is a few tens of thousands of dollars   to pay your expenses while you develop a prototype.  This is calledseed capital.  Because so little money is involved, raising seedcapital is comparatively easy-- at least in the sense of getting aquick yes or no.Usually you get seed money from individual rich people called\"angels.\" Often they\\'re people who themselves got rich from technology.At the seed stage, investors don\\'t expect you to have an elaboratebusiness plan.  Most know that they\\'re supposed to decide quickly.It\\'s not unusual to get a check within a week based on a half-pageagreement.We started Viaweb with $10,000 of seed money from our friend Julian.But he gave us a lot more than money.  He\\'s a former CEO and alsoa corporate lawyer, so he gave us a lot of valuable advice aboutbusiness, and also did all the legal work of getting us set up asa company.  Plus he introduced us to one of the two angel investors who supplied our next round of funding.Some angels, especially those with technology backgrounds, may be     satisfied with a demo and a verbal description of what you plan to do.  But many will want a copy of your business plan, if only toremind themselves what they invested in.Our angels asked for one, and looking back, I\\'m amazed how muchworry it caused me.  \"Business plan\" has that word \"business\" init, so I figured it had to be something I\\'d have to read a bookabout business plans to write.  Well, it doesn\\'t.  At this stage,all most investors expect is a brief description of what you plan    to do and how you\\'re going to make money from it, and the resumes of the founders.  If you just sit down and write out what you\\'vebeen saying to one another, that should be fine.  It shouldn\\'t takemore than a couple hours, and you\\'ll probably find that writing itall down gives you more ideas about what to do.For the angel to have someone to make the check out to, you\\'re goingto have to have some kind of company.  Merely incorporating yourselvesisn\\'t hard.  The problem is, for the company to exist, you have todecide who the founders are, and how much stock they each have.  Ifthere are two founders with the same qualifications who are bothequally committed to the business, that\\'s easy.  But if you have anumber of people who are expected to contribute in varying degrees,arranging the proportions of stock can be hard.  And once you\\'vedone it, it tends to be set in stone.I have no tricks for dealing with this problem.  All I can say is,try hard to do it right.  I do have a rule of thumb for recognizingwhen you have, though.  When everyone feels they\\'re getting aslightly bad deal, that they\\'re doing more than they should for theamount of stock they have, the stock is optimally apportioned.There is more to setting up a company than incorporating it, ofcourse: insurance, business license, unemployment compensation,    various things with the IRS.  I\\'m not even sure what the list is,because we, ah, skipped all that.  When we got real funding nearthe end of 1996, we hired a great CFO, who fixed everything   retroactively.  It turns out that no one comes and arrests you ifyou don\\'t do everything you\\'re supposed to when starting a company.And a good thing too, or a lot of startups would never get started.[5]It can be dangerous to delay turning yourself into a company, becauseone or more of the founders might decide to split off and start   another company doing the same thing.  This does happen.  So whenyou set up the company, as well as as apportioning the stock, youshould get all the founders to sign something agreeing that everyone\\'sideas belong to this company, and that this company is going to beeveryone\\'s only job.[If this were a movie, ominous music would begin here.]While you\\'re at it, you should ask what else they\\'ve signed.  Oneof the worst things that can happen to a startup is to run into       intellectual property problems.  We did, and it came closer to killing us than any competitor ever did.As we were in the middle of getting bought, we discovered that oneof our people had, early on, been bound by an agreement that saidall his ideas belonged to the giant company that was paying for himto go to grad school.  In theory, that could have meant someoneelse owned big chunks of our software.  So the acquisition came toa screeching halt while we tried to sort this out.  The problem      was, since we\\'d been about to be acquired, we\\'d allowed ourselves to run low on cash.  Now we needed to raise more to keep going. But it\\'s hard to raise money with an IP cloud over your head, becauseinvestors can\\'t judge how serious it is.Our existing investors, knowing that we needed money and had nowhereelse to get it, at this point attempted certain gambits which Iwill not describe in detail, except to remind readers that the word   \"angel\" is a metaphor.  The founders thereupon proposed to walk   away from the company, after giving the investors a brief tutorial on how to administer the servers themselves.  And while this washappening, the acquirers used the delay as an excuse to welch on  the deal.Miraculously it all turned out ok.  The investors backed down; wedid another round of funding at a reasonable valuation; the giantcompany finally gave us a piece of paper saying they didn\\'t own oursoftware; and six months later we were bought by Yahoo for muchmore than the earlier acquirer had agreed to pay.  So we were happyin the end, though the experience probably took several years off  my life.Don\\'t do what we did.  Before you consummate a startup, ask everyone about their previous IP history.Once you\\'ve got a company set up, it may seem presumptuous to goknocking on the doors of rich people and asking them to invest tensof thousands of dollars in something that is really just a bunch of guys with some ideas.  But when you look at it from the richpeople\\'s point of view, the picture is more encouraging. Most rich people are looking for good investments.  If you really think youhave a chance of succeeding, you\\'re doing them a favor by lettingthem invest.  Mixed with any annoyance they might feel about being   approached will be the thought: are these guys the next Google?Usually angels are financially equivalent to founders.  They get the same kind of stock and get diluted the same amount in futurerounds.  How much stock should they get?  That depends on howambitious you feel.  When you offer x percent of your company fory dollars, you\\'re implicitly claiming a certain value for the wholecompany.  Venture investments are usually described in terms ofthat number.  If you give an investor new shares equal to 5% ofthose already outstanding in return for $100,000, then you\\'ve donethe deal at a pre-money valuation of $2 million.How do you decide what the value of the company should be?  Thereis no rational way.  At this stage the company is just a bet.  Ididn\\'t realize that when we were raising money.  Julianthought we ought to value the company at several million dollars.  I thought it was preposterous to claim that a couplethousand lines of code, which was all we had at the time, were worthseveral million dollars.  Eventually we settled on one million,because Julian said no one would invest in a company with a valuationany lower. [6]What I didn\\'t grasp at the time was that the valuation wasn\\'t just   the value of the code we\\'d written so far.  It was also the valueof our ideas, which turned out to be right, and of all the futurework we\\'d do, which turned out to be a lot.The next round of funding is the one in which you might deal with actualventure capital firms.  But don\\'t wait till you\\'ve burned   through your last round of funding to start approaching them.  VCs are slow tomake up their minds.  They can take months.  You don\\'t want to be running out of money while you\\'re trying to negotiate with them.Getting money from an actual VC firm is a bigger deal than gettingmoney from angels.  The amounts of money involved are larger, millionsusually.  So the deals take longer, dilute you more, and imposemore onerous conditions.Sometimes the VCs want to install a new CEO of their own choosing. Usually the claim is that you need someone mature and experienced,with a business background.  Maybe in some cases this is true.   Andyet Bill Gates was young and inexperienced and had no business background, and he seems to have done ok.  Steve Jobs got bootedout of his own company by someone mature and experienced, with abusiness background, who then proceeded to ruin the company.  So Ithink people who are mature and experienced, with a businessbackground, may be overrated.  We used to call these guys \"newscasters,\"because they had neat hair and spoke in deep, confident voices, andgenerally didn\\'t know much more than they read on the teleprompter.We talked to a number of VCs, but eventually we ended up financingour startup entirely with angel money.  The main reason was that     we feared a brand-name VC firm would stick us with a newscaster aspart of the deal.  That might have been ok if he was content tolimit himself to talking to the press, but what if he wanted to  have a say in running the company?   That would have led to disaster,because our software was so complex.  We were a company whose wholem.o. was to win through better technology.  The strategic decisionswere mostly decisions about technology, and we didn\\'t need any helpwith those.This was also one reason we didn\\'t go public.  Back in 1998 our CFOtried to talk me into it.  In those days you could go public as adogfood portal, so as a company with a real product and real revenues,we might have done well.  But I feared it would have meant takingon a newscaster-- someone who, as they say, \"can talk Wall Street\\'slanguage.\"I\\'m happy to see Google is bucking that trend.  They didn\\'t talkWall Street\\'s language when they did their IPO, and Wall Streetdidn\\'t buy.  And now Wall Street is collectively kicking itself.They\\'ll pay attention next time.  Wall Street learns new languages   fast when money is involved.You have more leverage negotiating with VCs than you realize.  The   reason is other VCs.  I know a number of VCs now, and when you talkto them you realize that it\\'s a seller\\'s market.  Even now thereis too much money chasing too few good deals.VCs form a pyramid.  At the top are famous ones like Sequoia andKleiner Perkins, but beneath those are a huge number you\\'ve never heard of.  What they all have in common is that a dollar from them is worth one dollar.  Most VCs will tell you that they don\\'t just provide money, but connections and advice.  If you\\'re talking to  Vinod Khosla or John Doerr or Mike Moritz, this is true.  But suchadvice and connections can come very expensive.  And as you go downthe food chain the VCs get rapidlydumber.  A few steps down from the top you\\'re basically talking to bankers who\\'ve picked up a fewnew vocabulary words from readingWired.  (Does your productuseXML?)  So I\\'d advise you to be skeptical about claimsof experience and connections.  Basically, a VC is a source ofmoney.  I\\'d be inclined to go with whoever offered the most money  the soonest with the least strings attached.You may wonder how much to tell VCs.  And you should, because someof them may one day be funding your competitors.  I think the bestplan is not to be overtly secretive, but not to tell them everythingeither.  After all, as most VCs say, they\\'re more interested in thepeople than the ideas.  The main reason they want to talk aboutyour idea is to judge you, not the idea.  So as long as you seemlike you know what you\\'re doing, you can probably keep a few thingsback from them. [7]Talk to as many VCs as you can, even if you don\\'t want their money,because a) they may be on the board of someone who will buy you,     and b) if you seem impressive, they\\'ll be discouraged from investingin your competitors.  The most efficient way to reach VCs, especiallyif you only want them to know about you and don\\'t want their money,is at the conferences that are occasionally organized for startups   to present to them.Not Spending ItWhen and if you get an infusion of real money from investors, whatshould you do with it?  Not spend it, that\\'s what.  In nearly every   startup that fails, the proximate cause is running out of money. Usually there is something deeper wrong.  But even a proximate causeof death is worth trying hard to avoid.During the Bubble many startups tried to \"get big fast.\" Ideallythis meant getting a lot of customers fast.  But it was easy forthe meaning to slide over into hiring a lot of people fast.Of the two versions, the one where you get a lot of customers fastis of course preferable.  But even that may be overrated.  The ideais to get there first and get all the users, leaving none forcompetitors.  But I think in most businesses the advantages of beingfirst to market are not so overwhelmingly great.  Google is againa case in point.  When they appeared it seemed as if search was amature market, dominated by big players who\\'d spent millions tobuild their brands: Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Infoseek, Altavista,  Inktomi.  Surely 1998 was a little late to arrive at the party.But as the founders of Google knew, brand is worth next to nothingin the search business.  You can come along at any point and make something better, and users will gradually seep over to you.  As  if to emphasize the point, Google never did any advertising.  They\\'relike dealers; they sell the stuff, but they know better than to useit themselves.The competitors Google buried would have done better to spend thosemillions improving their software.  Future startups should learnfrom that mistake.  Unless you\\'re in a market where products are   as undifferentiated as cigarettes or vodka or laundry detergent,spending a lot on brand advertising is a sign of breakage.  And fewif any Web businesses are so undifferentiated.  The dating sites  are running big ad campaigns right now, which is all the more evidence they\\'re ripe for the picking.  (Fee, fie, fo, fum, I  smell a company run by marketing guys.)We were compelled by circumstances to grow slowly, and in retrospectit was a good thing.  The founders all learned to do every job in  the company.  As well as writing software, I had to do sales andcustomer support.  At sales I was not very good.  I was persistent,but I didn\\'t have the smoothness of a good salesman.  My message   to potential customers was: you\\'d be stupid not to sell online, and  if you sell online you\\'d be stupid to use anyone else\\'s software.   Both statements were true, but that\\'s not the way to convince people.I was great at customer support though.  Imagine talking to acustomer support person who not only knew everything about theproduct, but would apologize abjectly if there was a bug, and thenfix it immediately, while you were on the phone with them.  Customersloved us.  And we loved them, because when you\\'re growing slow byword of mouth, your first batch of users are the ones who were smartenough to find you by themselves.  There is nothing more valuable,in the early stages of a startup, than smart users.  If you listento them, they\\'ll tell you exactly how to make a winning product.      And not only will they give you this advice for free, they\\'ll payyou.We officially launched in early 1996.  By the end of that year wehad about 70 users.  Since this was the era of \"get big fast,\" Iworried about how small and obscure we were.  But in fact we weredoing exactly the right thing.  Once you get big (in users oremployees) it gets hard to change your product.  That year waseffectively a laboratory for improving our software.  By the end  of it, we were so far ahead of our competitors that they never had a hope of catching up.  And since all the hackers had spent manyhours talking to users, we understood online commerce way betterthan anyone else.That\\'s the key to success as a startup.  There is nothing more important than understanding your business.  You might think thatanyone in a business must, ex officio, understand it.  Far from it.   Google\\'s secretweapon was simply that they understood search.  I was working for Yahoo when Google appeared, and Yahoo didn\\'t understand search.  Iknow because I once tried to convince the powers that be that wehad to make search better, and I got in reply what was then theparty line about it: that Yahoo was no longer a mere \"search engine.\"Search was now only a small percentage of our page views, less thanone month\\'s growth, and now that we were established as a \"media   company,\" or \"portal,\" or whatever we were, search could safely beallowed to wither and drop off, like an umbilical cord.Well, a small fraction of page views they may be, but they are an  important fraction, because they are the page views that Web sessions  start with.  I think Yahoo gets that now.Google understands a few other things most Web companies stilldon\\'t.  The most important is that you should put users beforeadvertisers, even though the advertisers are paying and users aren\\'t.One of my favorite bumper stickers reads \"if the people lead, the  leaders will follow.\" Paraphrased for the Web, this becomes \"getall the users, and the advertisers will follow.\"  More generally,design your product to please users first, and then think about howto make money from it.  If you don\\'t put users first, you leave a    gap for competitors who do.To make something users love, you have to understand them.  And thebigger you are, the harder that is.  So I say \"get big slow.\" Theslower you burn through your funding, the more time you have tolearn.The other reason to spend money slowly is to encourage a culture of cheapness.  That\\'s something Yahoo did understand.  David Filo\\'s title was \"Chief Yahoo,\" but he was proud that his unofficial titlewas \"Cheap Yahoo.\"  Soon after we arrived at Yahoo, we got an emailfrom Filo, who had been crawling around our directory hierarchy,      asking if it was really necessary to store so much of our data onexpensive RAID drives.  I was impressed by that.  Yahoo\\'s marketcap then was already in the billions, and they were still worryingabout wasting a few gigs of disk space.When you get a couple million dollars from a VC firm, you tend tofeel rich.  It\\'s important to realize you\\'re not.  A rich companyis one with large revenues.  This money isn\\'t revenue.  It\\'s moneyinvestors have given you in the hope you\\'ll be able to generate   revenues.  So despite those millions in the bank, you\\'re still poor.For most startups the model should be grad student, not law firm.Aim for cool and cheap, not expensive and impressive.  For us thetest of whether a startup understood this was whether they had Aeronchairs.  The Aeron came out during the Bubble and was very popularwith startups.  Especially the type, all too common then, that waslike a bunch of kids playing house with money supplied by VCs.   We   had office chairs so cheap that the arms all fell off.  This was slightly embarrassing at the time, but in retrospect the grad-studentyatmosphere of our office was another of those things we did right without knowing it.Our offices were in a wooden triple-decker in Harvard Square.  Ithad been an apartment until about the 1970s, and there was still a   claw-footed bathtub in the bathroom.  It must once have been inhabitedby someone fairly eccentric, because a lot of the chinks in the    walls were stuffed with aluminum foil, as if to protect against   cosmic rays.  When eminent visitors came to see us, we were a bitsheepish about the low production values.  But in fact that placewas the perfect space for a startup.  We felt like our role was to be impudent underdogs instead of corporate stuffed shirts, and that    is exactly the spirit you want.An apartment is also the right kind of place for developing software.Cube farms suck for that, as you\\'ve probably discovered if you\\'vetried it.  Ever notice how much easier it is to hack at home thanat work?  So why not make work more like home?When you\\'re looking for space for a startup, don\\'t feel that it hasto look professional.  Professional means doing good work, notelevators and glass walls.  I\\'d advise most startups to avoidcorporate space at first and just rent an apartment.  You want tolive at the office in a startup, so why not have a place designedto be lived in as your office?Besides being cheaper and better to work in, apartments tend to bein better locations than office buildings.  And for a startuplocation is very important.  The key to productivity is for peopleto come back to work after dinner.  Those hours after the phonestops ringing are by far the best for getting work done.  Greatthings happen when a group of employees go out to dinner together, talk over ideas, and then come back to their offices to implement  them.  So you want to be in a place where there are a lot ofrestaurants around, not some dreary office park that\\'s a wastelandafter 6:00 PM.  Once a company shifts over into the model where everyone drives home to the suburbs for dinner, however late, you\\'velost something extraordinarily valuable.  God help you if youactually start in that mode.If I were going to start a startup today, there are only three   places I\\'d consider doing it: on the Red Line near Central, Harvard,or Davis Squares (Kendall is too sterile); in Palo Alto on Universityor California Aves; and in Berkeley immediately north or south of   campus.  These are the only places I know that have the right kindof vibe.The most important way to not spend money is by not hiring people.  I may be an extremist, but I think hiring people is the worst thinga company can do.  To start with, people are a recurring expense, which is the worst kind.  They also tend to cause you to grow out     of your space, and perhaps even move to the sort of uncool officebuilding that will make your software worse.  But worst of all,they slow you down: instead of sticking your head in someone\\'s    office and checking out an idea with them, eight people have tohave a meeting about it.  So the fewer people you can hire, thebetter.During the Bubble a lot of startups had the opposite policy.  Theywanted to get \"staffed up\" as soon as possible, as if you couldn\\'t get anything done unless there was someone with the corresponding job title.  That\\'s big company thinking.  Don\\'t hire people to fillthe gaps in some a priori org chart.  The only reason to hire someoneis to do something you\\'d like to do but can\\'t.If hiring unnecessary people is expensive and slows you down, whydo nearly all companies do it?  I think the main reason is thatpeople like the idea of having a lot of people working for them.This weakness often extends right up to the CEO.  If you ever endup running a company, you\\'ll find the most common question peopleask is how many employees you have.  This is their way of weighingyou.  It\\'s not just random people who ask this; even reporters do.And they\\'re going to be a lot more impressed if the answer is athousand than if it\\'s ten.This is ridiculous, really.  If two companies have the same revenues,it\\'s the one with fewer employees that\\'s more impressive.  When  people used to ask me how many people our startup had, and I answered\"twenty,\" I could see them thinking that we didn\\'t count for much.I used to want to add \"but our main competitor, whose ass we regularlykick, has a hundred and forty, so can we have credit for the largerof the two numbers?\"As with office space, the number of your employees is a choice between seeming impressive, and being impressive.  Any of you who  werenerdsin high school know about this choice.  Keep doing it when you start a company.Should You?But should you start a company?  Are you the right sort of personto do it?  If you are, is it worth it?More people are the right sort of person to start a startup thanrealize it.  That\\'s the main reason I wrote this.  There could be   ten times more startups than there are, and that would probably bea good thing.I was, I now realize, exactly the right sort of person to start a   startup.  But the idea terrified me at first.  I was forced into   it because I was aLisphacker.  The companyI\\'d been consulting for seemed to be running into trouble, and there  were not a lot of other companies using Lisp.  Since I couldn\\'t  bear the thought of programming in another language (this was 1995,remember, when \"another language\" meant C++) the only option seemedto be to start a new company using Lisp.I realize this sounds far-fetched, but if you\\'re a Lisp hackeryou\\'ll know what I mean.  And if the idea of starting a startupfrightened me so much that I only did it out of necessity, there  must be a lot of people who would be good at it but who are too    intimidated to try.So who should start a startup?  Someone who is a good hacker, betweenabout 23 and 38, and who wants to solve the money problem in oneshot instead of getting paid gradually over a conventional workinglife.I can\\'t say precisely what a good hacker is.  At a first rate   university this might include the top half of computer science   majors.  Though of course you don\\'t have to be a CS major to be ahacker; I was a philosophy major in college.It\\'s hard to tell whether you\\'re a good hacker, especially whenyou\\'re young.  Fortunately the process of starting startups tendsto select them automatically.  What drives people to start startupsis (or should be) looking at existing technology and thinking, don\\'t these guys realize they should be doing x, y, and z?  And that\\'s also a sign that one is a good hacker.I put the lower bound at 23 not because there\\'s something thatdoesn\\'t happen to your brain till then, but because you need to seewhat it\\'s like in an existing business before you try running yourown.  The business doesn\\'t have to be a startup.  I spent a yearworking for a software company to pay off my college loans.  It wasthe worst year of my adult life, but I learned, without realizing  it at the time, a lot of valuable lessons about the software business.In this case they were mostly negative lessons: don\\'t have a lotof meetings; don\\'t have chunks of code that multiple people own;don\\'t have a sales guy running the company; don\\'t make a high-endproduct; don\\'t let your code get too big; don\\'t leave finding bugsto QA people; don\\'t go too long between releases; don\\'t isolatedevelopers from users; don\\'t move from Cambridge to Route 128; andso on. [8] But negative lessons are just as valuable as positive ones.  Perhaps even more valuable: it\\'s hard to repeat a brilliantperformance, but it\\'s straightforward to avoid errors. [9]The other reason it\\'s hard to start a company before 23 is that     people won\\'t take you seriously.  VCs won\\'t trust you, and will tryto reduce you to a mascot as a condition of funding.  Customerswill worry you\\'re going to flake out and leave them stranded.  Evenyou yourself, unless you\\'re very unusual, will feel your age to     some degree; you\\'ll find it awkward to be the boss of someone much older than you, and if you\\'re 21, hiring only people younger rather limits your options.Some people could probably start a company at 18 if they wanted to.Bill Gates was 19 when he and Paul Allen started Microsoft.  (Paul Allen was 22, though, and that probably made a difference.) So ifyou\\'re thinking, I don\\'t care what he says, I\\'m going to start acompany now, you may be the sort of person who could get away withit.The other cutoff, 38, has a lot more play in it.  One reason I put it there is that I don\\'t think many people have the physical staminamuch past that age.   I used to work till 2:00 or 3:00 AM everynight, seven days a week.  I don\\'t know if I could do that now.Also,startups are a big risk financially.  If you try something thatblows up and leaves you broke at 26, big deal; a lot of 26 yearolds are broke.  By 38 you can\\'t take so many risks-- especiallyif you have kids.My final test may be the most restrictive.  Do you actually wantto start a startup?  What it amounts to, economically, is compressingyour working life into the smallest possible space.  Instead ofworking at an ordinary rate for 40 years, you work like hell for four.  And maybe end up with nothing-- though in that case itprobably won\\'t take four years.During this time you\\'ll do little but work, because when you\\'re notworking, your competitors will be.  My only leisure activities wererunning, which I needed to do to keep working anyway, and aboutfifteen minutes of reading a night.  I had a girlfriend for a totalof two months during that three year period.  Every couple weeks Iwould take a few hours off to visit a used bookshop or go to a  friend\\'s house for dinner.  I went to visit my family twice.Otherwise I just worked.Working was often fun, because the people I worked with were someof my best friends.  Sometimes it was even technically interesting.But only about 10% of the time.  The best I can say for the other90% is that some of it is funnier in hindsight than it seemed then.Like the time the power went off in Cambridge for about six hours,and we made the mistake of trying to start a gasoline poweredgenerator inside our offices. I won\\'t try that again.I don\\'t think the amount of bullshit you have to deal with in astartup is more than you\\'d endure in an ordinary working life.  It\\'sprobably less, in fact; it just seems like a lot because it\\'s       compressed into a short period.  So mainly what a startup buys you is time.  That\\'s the way to think about it if you\\'re trying to decide whether to start one.  If you\\'re the sort of person who wouldlike to solve the money problem once and for all instead of working for a salary for 40 years, then a startup makes sense.For a lot of people the conflict is between startups and graduateschool.  Grad students are just the age, and just the sort of people,to start software startups.  You may worry that if you do you\\'ll   blow your chances of an academic career.  But it\\'s possible to be  part of a startup and stay in grad school, especially at first.  Two of our three original hackers were in grad school the whole time, and both got theirdegrees. There are few sources of energyso powerful as a procrastinating grad student.If you do have toleave grad school, in the worst case it won\\'t be for too long.  Ifa startup fails, it will probably fail quickly enough that you can return to academic life.  And if it succeeds, you may find you no   longer have such a burning desire to be an assistant professor.If you want to do it, do it.  Starting a startup is not the greatmystery it seems from outside.  It\\'s not something you have to knowabout \"business\" to do.  Build something users love, and spend lessthan you make.  How hard is that?'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'What should an essay be? Many people would say persuasive. That\\'swhat a lot of us were taught essays should be. But I think we canaim for something more ambitious: that an essay should be useful.To start with, that means it should be correct. But it\\'s not enoughmerely to be correct. It\\'s easy to make a statement correct bymaking it vague. That\\'s a common flaw in academic writing, forexample. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can\\'t gowrong by saying that the issue is a complex one, that there aremany factors to be considered, that it\\'s a mistake to take toosimplistic a view of it, and so on.Though no doubt correct, such statements tell the reader nothing.Useful writing makes claims that are as strong as they can be madewithout becoming false.For example, it\\'s more useful to say that Pike\\'s Peak is near themiddle of Colorado than merely somewhere in Colorado. But if I sayit\\'s in the exact middle of Colorado, I\\'ve now gone too far, becauseit\\'s a bit east of the middle.Precision and correctness are like opposing forces. It\\'s easy tosatisfy one if you ignore the other. The converse of vaporousacademic writing is the bold, but false, rhetoric of demagogues.Useful writing is bold, but true.It\\'s also two other things: it tells people something important,and that at least some of them didn\\'t already know.Telling people something they didn\\'t know doesn\\'t always meansurprising them. Sometimes it means telling them something theyknew unconsciously but had never put into words. In fact those maybe the more valuable insights, because they tend to be morefundamental.Let\\'s put them all together. Useful writing tells people somethingtrue and important that they didn\\'t already know, and tells themas unequivocally as possible.Notice these are all a matter of degree. For example, you can\\'texpect an idea to be novel to everyone. Any insight that you havewill probably have already been had by at least one of the world\\'s7 billion people. But it\\'s sufficient if an idea is novel to a lotof readers.Ditto for correctness, importance, and strength. In effect the fourcomponents are like numbers you can multiply together to get a scorefor usefulness. Which I realize is almost awkwardly reductive, butnonetheless true._____How can you ensure that the things you say are true and novel andimportant? Believe it or not, there is a trick for doing this. Ilearned it from my friend Robert Morris, who has a horror of sayinganything dumb. His trick is not to say anything unless he\\'s sureit\\'s worth hearing. This makes it hard to get opinions out of him,but when you do, they\\'re usually right.Translated into essay writing, what this means is that if you writea bad sentence, you don\\'t publish it. You delete it and try again.Often you abandon whole branches of four or five paragraphs. Sometimesa whole essay.You can\\'t ensure that every idea you have is good, but you canensure that every one you publish is, by simply not publishing theones that aren\\'t.In the sciences, this is called publication bias, and is consideredbad. When some hypothesis you\\'re exploring gets inconclusive results,you\\'re supposed to tell people about that too. But with essaywriting, publication bias is the way to go.My strategy is loose, then tight. I write the first draft of anessay fast, trying out all kinds of ideas. Then I spend days rewritingit very carefully.I\\'ve never tried to count how many times I proofread essays, butI\\'m sure there are sentences I\\'ve read 100 times before publishingthem. When I proofread an essay, there are usually passages thatstick out in an annoying way, sometimes because they\\'re clumsilywritten, and sometimes because I\\'m not sure they\\'re true. Theannoyance starts out unconscious, but after the tenth reading orso I\\'m saying \"Ugh, that part\" each time I hit it. They become likebriars that catch your sleeve as you walk past. Usually I won\\'tpublish an essay till they\\'re all gone — till I can read throughthe whole thing without the feeling of anything catching.I\\'ll sometimes let through a sentence that seems clumsy, if I can\\'tthink of a way to rephrase it, but I will never knowingly let throughone that doesn\\'t seem correct. You never have to. If a sentencedoesn\\'t seem right, all you have to do is ask why it doesn\\'t, andyou\\'ve usually got the replacement right there in your head.This is where essayists have an advantage over journalists. Youdon\\'t have a deadline. You can work for as long on an essay as youneed to get it right. You don\\'t have to publish the essay at all,if you can\\'t get it right. Mistakes seem to lose courage in theface of an enemy with unlimited resources. Or that\\'s what it feelslike. What\\'s really going on is that you have different expectationsfor yourself. You\\'re like a parent saying to a child \"we can sithere all night till you eat your vegetables.\" Except you\\'re thechild too.I\\'m not saying no mistake gets through. For example, I added condition(c) in\"A Way to Detect Bias\"after readers pointed out that I\\'domitted it. But in practice you can catch nearly all of them.There\\'s a trick for getting importance too. It\\'s like the trick Isuggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make somethingyou yourself want. You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader.The reader is not completely unlike you, so if you write abouttopics that seem important to you, they\\'ll probably seem importantto a significant number of readers as well.Importance has two factors. It\\'s the number of people somethingmatters to, times how much it matters to them. Which means of coursethat it\\'s not a rectangle, but a sort of ragged comb, like a Riemannsum.The way to get novelty is to write about topics you\\'ve thought abouta lot. Then you can use yourself as a proxy for the reader in thisdepartment too. Anything you notice that surprises you, who\\'vethought about the topic a lot, will probably also surprise asignificant number of readers. And here, as with correctness andimportance, you can use the Morris technique to ensure that youwill. If you don\\'t learn anything from writing an essay, don\\'tpublish it.You need humility to measure novelty, because acknowledging thenovelty of an idea means acknowledging your previous ignorance ofit. Confidence and humility are often seen as opposites, but inthis case, as in many others, confidence helps you to be humble.If you know you\\'re an expert on some topic, you can freely admitwhen you learn something you didn\\'t know, because you can be confidentthat most other people wouldn\\'t know it either.The fourth component of useful writing, strength, comes from twothings: thinking well, and the skillful use of qualification. Thesetwo counterbalance each other, like the accelerator and clutch ina car with a manual transmission. As you try to refine the expressionof an idea, you adjust the qualification accordingly. Somethingyou\\'re sure of, you can state baldly with no qualification at all,as I did the four components of useful writing. Whereas points thatseem dubious have to be held at arm\\'s length with perhapses.As you refine an idea, you\\'re pushing in the direction of lessqualification. But you can rarely get it down to zero. Sometimesyou don\\'t even want to, if it\\'s a side point and a fully refinedversion would be too long.Some say that qualifications weaken writing. For example, that youshould never begin a sentence in an essay with \"I think,\" becauseif you\\'re saying it, then of course you think it. And it\\'s truethat \"I think x\" is a weaker statement than simply \"x.\" Which isexactly why you need \"I think.\" You need it to express your degreeof certainty.But qualifications are not scalars. They\\'re not just experimentalerror. There must be 50 things they can express: how broadly somethingapplies, how you know it, how happy you are it\\'s so, even how itcould be falsified. I\\'m not going to try to explore the structureof qualification here. It\\'s probably more complex than the wholetopic of writing usefully. Instead I\\'ll just give you a practicaltip: Don\\'t underestimate qualification. It\\'s an important skill inits own right, not just a sort of tax you have to pay in order toavoid saying things that are false. So learn and use its full range.It may not be fully half of having good ideas, but it\\'s part ofhaving them.There\\'s one other quality I aim for in essays: to say things assimply as possible. But I don\\'t think this is a component ofusefulness. It\\'s more a matter of consideration for the reader. Andit\\'s a practical aid in getting things right; a mistake is moreobvious when expressed in simple language. But I\\'ll admit that themain reason I write simply is not for the reader\\'s sake or becauseit helps get things right, but because it bothers me to use moreor fancier words than I need to. It seems inelegant, like a programthat\\'s too long.I realize florid writing works for some people. But unless you\\'resure you\\'re one of them, the best advice is to write as simply asyou can._____I believe the formula I\\'ve given you, importance + novelty +correctness + strength, is the recipe for a good essay. But I shouldwarn you that it\\'s also a recipe for making people mad.The root of the problem is novelty. When you tell people somethingthey didn\\'t know, they don\\'t always thank you for it. Sometimes thereason people don\\'t know something is because they don\\'t want toknow it. Usually because it contradicts some cherished belief. Andindeed, if you\\'re looking for novel ideas, popular but mistakenbeliefs are a good place to find them. Every popular mistaken beliefcreates adead zoneof ideas around it that are relatively unexplored because they contradict it.The strength component just makes things worse. If there\\'s anythingthat annoys people more than having their cherished assumptionscontradicted, it\\'s having them flatly contradicted.Plus if you\\'ve used the Morris technique, your writing will seemquite confident. Perhaps offensively confident, to people whodisagree with you. The reason you\\'ll seem confident is that you areconfident: you\\'ve cheated, by only publishing the things you\\'resure of.  It will seem to people who try to disagree with you thatyou never admit you\\'re wrong. In fact you constantly admit you\\'rewrong. You just do it before publishing instead of after.And if your writing is as simple as possible, that just makes thingsworse. Brevity is the diction of command. If you watch someonedelivering unwelcome news from a position of inferiority, you\\'llnotice they tend to use lots of words, to soften the blow. Whereasto be short with someone is more or less to be rude to them.It can sometimes work to deliberately phrase statements more weaklythan you mean. To put \"perhaps\" in front of something you\\'re actuallyquite sure of. But you\\'ll notice that when writers do this, theyusually do it with a wink.I don\\'t like to do this too much. It\\'s cheesy to adopt an ironictone for a whole essay. I think we just have to face the fact thatelegance and curtness are two names for the same thing.You might think that if you work sufficiently hard to ensure thatan essay is correct, it will be invulnerable to attack. That\\'s sortof true. It will be invulnerable to valid attacks. But in practicethat\\'s little consolation.In fact, the strength component of useful writing will make youparticularly vulnerable to misrepresentation. If you\\'ve stated anidea as strongly as you could without making it false, all anyonehas to do is to exaggerate slightly what you said, and now it isfalse.Much of the time they\\'re not even doing it deliberately. One of themost surprising things you\\'ll discover, if you start writing essays,is that people who disagree with you rarely disagree with whatyou\\'ve actually written. Instead they make up something you saidand disagree with that.For what it\\'s worth, the countermove is to ask someone who doesthis to quote a specific sentence or passage you wrote that theybelieve is false, and explain why. I say \"for what it\\'s worth\"because they never do. So although it might seem that this couldget a broken discussion back on track, the truth is that it wasnever on track in the first place.Should you explicitly forestall likely misinterpretations? Yes, ifthey\\'re misinterpretations a reasonably smart and well-intentionedperson might make. In fact it\\'s sometimes better to say somethingslightly misleading and then add the correction than to try to getan idea right in one shot. That can be more efficient, and can alsomodel the way such an idea would be discovered.But I don\\'t think you should explicitly forestall intentionalmisinterpretations in the body of an essay. An essay is a place tomeet honest readers. You don\\'t want to spoil your house by puttingbars on the windows to protect against dishonest ones. The placeto protect against intentional misinterpretations is in end-notes.But don\\'t think you can predict them all. People are as ingeniousat misrepresenting you when you say something they don\\'t want tohear as they are at coming up with rationalizations for things theywant to do but know they shouldn\\'t. I suspect it\\'s the same skill._____As with most other things, the way to get better at writing essaysis to practice. But how do you start? Now that we\\'ve examined thestructure of useful writing, we can rephrase that question moreprecisely. Which constraint do you relax initially? The answer is,the first component of importance: the number of people who careabout what you write.If you narrow the topic sufficiently, you can probably find somethingyou\\'re an expert on. Write about that to start with. If you onlyhave ten readers who care, that\\'s fine. You\\'re helping them, andyou\\'re writing. Later you can expand the breadth of topics you writeabout.The other constraint you can relax is a little surprising: publication.Writing essays doesn\\'t have to mean publishing them. That may seemstrange now that the trend is to publish every random thought, butit worked for me. I wrote what amounted to essays in notebooks forabout 15 years. I never published any of them and never expectedto. I wrote them as a way of figuring things out. But when the webcame along I\\'d had a lot of practice.Incidentally,Steve Wozniakdid the same thing. In high school hedesigned computers on paper for fun. He couldn\\'t build them becausehe couldn\\'t afford the components. But when Intel launched 4K DRAMsin 1975, he was ready._____How many essays are there left to write though? The answer to thatquestion is probably the most exciting thing I\\'ve learned aboutessay writing. Nearly all of them are left to write.Althoughthe essayis an old form, it hasn\\'t been assiduouslycultivated. In the print era, publication was expensive, and therewasn\\'t enough demand for essays to publish that many. You couldpublish essays if you were already well known for writing somethingelse, like novels. Or you could write book reviews that you tookover to express your own ideas. But there was not really a directpath to becoming an essayist. Which meant few essays got written,and those that did tended to be about a narrow range of subjects.Now, thanks to the internet, there\\'s a path. Anyone can publishessays online. You start in obscurity, perhaps, but at least youcan start. You don\\'t need anyone\\'s permission.It sometimes happens that an area of knowledge sits quietly foryears, till some change makes it explode. Cryptography did this tonumber theory. The internet is doing it to the essay.The exciting thing is not that there\\'s a lot left to write, butthat there\\'s a lot left to discover. There\\'s a certain kind of ideathat\\'s best discovered by writing essays. If most essays are stillunwritten, most such ideas are still undiscovered.'},\n",

       "  'date': 'April 2004',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'To the popular press, \"hacker\" means someone who breaksinto computers.  Among programmers it means a good programmer.But the two meanings are connected.  To programmers,\"hacker\" connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someonewho can make a computer do what he wants—whether the computerwants to or not.To add to the confusion, the noun \"hack\" also has two senses.  It canbe either a compliment or an insult.  It\\'s called a hack whenyou do something in an ugly way.  But when you do somethingso clever that you somehow beat the system, that\\'s alsocalled a hack.  The word is used more often in the former thanthe latter sense, probably because ugly solutions are morecommon than brilliant ones.Believe it or not, the two senses of \"hack\" are alsoconnected.  Ugly and imaginative solutions have something incommon: they both break the rules.  And there is a gradualcontinuum between rule breaking that\\'s merely ugly (usingduct tape to attach something to your bike) and rule breakingthat is brilliantly imaginative (discarding Euclidean space).Hacking predates computers.  When hewas working on the Manhattan Project, Richard Feynman used toamuse himself by breaking into safes containing secret documents.This tradition continues today.When we were in grad school, a hacker friend of mine who spent too muchtime around MIT hadhis own lock picking kit.(He now runs a hedge fund, a not unrelated enterprise.)It is sometimes hard to explain to authorities why one wouldwant to do such things.Another friend of mine once got in trouble with the government forbreaking into computers.  This had only recently been declareda crime, and the FBI found that their usual investigativetechnique didn\\'t work.  Police investigation apparently begins witha motive.  The usual motives are few: drugs, money, sex,revenge.  Intellectual curiosity was not one of the motives onthe FBI\\'s list.  Indeed, the whole concept seemed foreign tothem.Those in authority tend to be annoyed by hackers\\'general attitude of disobedience.  But that disobedience isa byproduct of the qualities that make them good programmers.They may laugh at the CEO when he talks in generic corporatenewspeech, but they also laugh at someone who tells thema certain problem can\\'t be solved.Suppress one, and you suppress the other.This attitude is sometimes affected.  Sometimes young programmersnotice the eccentricities of eminent hackers and decide toadopt some of their own in order to seem smarter.The fake version is not merelyannoying; the prickly attitude of these poserscan actually slow the process of innovation.But even factoring in their annoying eccentricities,the disobedient attitude of hackers is a net win.  I wish itsadvantages were better understood.For example, I suspect people in Hollywood aresimply mystified byhackers\\' attitudes toward copyrights.  They are a perennialtopic of heated discussion on Slashdot.But why should people who program computersbe so concerned about copyrights, of all things?Partly because some companies usemechanismsto preventcopying.  Show any hacker a lock and his first thought ishow to pick it.  But there is a deeper reason thathackers are alarmed by measures like copyrights and patents.They see increasingly aggressive measures to protect\"intellectual property\"as a threat to the intellectualfreedom they need to do their job.And they are right.It is by poking about inside current technology thathackers get ideas for the next generation.  No thanks,intellectual homeowners may say, we don\\'t need anyoutside help.  But they\\'re wrong.The next generation of computer technology hasoften—perhaps more often than not—been developed by outsiders.In 1977 there was no doubt some group within IBM developingwhat they expected to bethe next generation of business computer.  They were mistaken.The next generation of business computer wasbeing developed on entirely different lines by two long-hairedguys called Steve in agaragein Los Altos.  At about thesame time, the powers that bewere cooperating to develop theofficial next generation operating system, Multics.But two guys who thought Multics excessively complex went offand wrote their own.  They gave it a name thatwas a joking reference to Multics: Unix.The latest intellectual property laws imposeunprecedented restrictions on the sort of poking around thatleads to new ideas. In the past, a competitor might use patentsto prevent you from selling a copy of something theymade, but they couldn\\'t prevent you fromtaking one apart to see how it worked.   The latestlaws make this a crime.  How are weto develop new technology if we can\\'t study currenttechnology to figure out how to improve it?Ironically, hackers have brought this on themselves.Computers are responsible for the problem.  The control systemsinside machines used to be physical: gears and levers and cams.Increasingly, the brains (and thus the value) of products isin software. And by this I mean software in the general sense:i.e. data.  A song on an LP is physically stamped into theplastic.  A song on an iPod\\'s disk is merely stored on it.Data is by definition easy to copy.  And the Internetmakes copies easy to distribute.  So it is no wondercompanies are afraid.  But, as so often happens, fear hasclouded their judgement.  The government has respondedwith draconian laws to protect intellectual property.They probably mean well. Butthey may not realize that such laws will do more harmthan good.Why are programmers so violently opposed to these laws?If I were a legislator, I\\'d be interested in thismystery—for the same reason that, if I were a farmer and suddenlyheard a lot of squawking coming from my hen house one night,I\\'d want to go out and investigate.  Hackers are not stupid,and unanimity is very rare in this world.So if they\\'re all squawking,   perhaps there is something amiss.Could it be that such laws, though intended to protect America,will actually harm it?  Think about it.  There is somethingveryAmericanabout Feynman breaking into safes duringthe Manhattan Project.  It\\'s hard to imagine the authoritieshaving a sense of humor about such things overin Germany at that time.  Maybe it\\'s not a coincidence.Hackers are unruly.  That is the essence of hacking.  And itis also the essence of Americanness.  It is no accidentthat Silicon Valleyis in America, and not France, or Germany,or England, or Japan. In those countries, people color insidethe lines.I lived for a while in Florence.  But after I\\'d been therea few months I realized that what I\\'d been unconsciously hopingto find there was back in the place I\\'d just left.The reason Florence is famous is that in 1450, it was New York.In 1450 it was filled with the kind of turbulent and ambitiouspeople you find now in America.  (So I went back to America.)It is greatly to America\\'s advantage that it isa congenial atmosphere for the right sort of unruliness—thatit is a home not just for the smart, but for smart-alecks.And hackers are invariably smart-alecks.  If we had a nationalholiday, it would be April 1st.  It says a great deal aboutour work that we use the same word for a brilliant or ahorribly cheesy solution.   When we cook one up we\\'re notalways 100% sure which kind it is.  But as long as it hasthe right sort of wrongness, that\\'s a promising sign.It\\'s odd that peoplethink of programming as precise and methodical.Computersare precise and methodical.  Hacking is something you dowith a gleeful laugh.In our world some of the most characteristic solutionsare not far removed from practicaljokes.  IBM was no doubt rather surprised by the consequencesof the licensing deal for DOS, just as the hypothetical\"adversary\" must be when Michael Rabin solves a problem byredefining it as one that\\'s easier to solve.Smart-alecks have to develop a keen sense of how much theycanget awaywith.  And lately hackers have sensed a changein the atmosphere.Lately hackerliness seems rather frowned upon.To hackers the recent contraction in civil liberties seemsespecially ominous.  That must also mystify outsiders. Why should we care especially about civilliberties?  Why programmers, more thandentists or salesmen or landscapers?Let me put the case in terms a government official would appreciate.Civil liberties are not just an ornament, or a quaintAmerican tradition.  Civil liberties make countries rich.If you made a graph ofGNP per capita vs. civil liberties, you\\'d notice a definitetrend.  Could civil liberties really be a cause, ratherthan just an effect?  I think so.  I think a society in whichpeople can do and say what they want will also tend tobe one in which the most efficient solutions win, rather thanthose sponsored by the most influential people.Authoritarian countries become corrupt;corrupt countries become poor; and poor countries are weak. It seems to me there isa Laffer curve for government power, just as fortax revenues.  At least, it seems likely enough that itwould be stupid to try the experiment and find out.  Unlikehigh tax rates, you can\\'t repeal totalitarianism if itturns out to be a mistake.This is why hackers worry.  The government spying on people doesn\\'tliterally make programmers write worse code.  It just leadseventually to a world in which bad ideas win.  And becausethis is so important to hackers, they\\'re especially sensitiveto it.  They can sense totalitarianism approaching from adistance, as animals can sense an approaching  thunderstorm.It would be ironic if, as hackers fear, recent measuresintended to protect national security and intellectual propertyturned out to be a missile aimed right at what makes   America successful.  But it would not be the first time thatmeasures taken in an atmosphere of panic hadthe opposite of the intended effect.There is such a thing as Americanness.There\\'s nothing like living abroad to teach you that.   And if you want to know whether something will nurture or squashthis quality, it would be hard to find a better focusgroup than hackers, because they come closest of any groupI know to embodying it.  Closer, probably,  thanthe men running our government,who for all their talk of patriotismremind me more of Richelieu or Mazarinthan Thomas Jefferson or George Washington.When you read what the founding fathers had to say forthemselves, they sound more like hackers.\"The spirit of resistance to government,\"Jefferson wrote, \"is so valuable on certain occasions, that I wishit always to be kept alive.\"Imagine an American president saying that today.Like the remarks of an outspoken old grandmother, the sayings ofthe founding fathers have embarrassed generations oftheir less confident successors.  They remind us where we come from.They remind us that it is the people who break rules that arethe source of America\\'s wealth and power.Those in a position to impose rules naturally want them to beobeyed.  But be careful what you ask for. You might get it.'},\n",

       "  'date': 'March 2008, rev May 2013',\n",
       "  'essay_text': '(This essay grew out of something I wrote for myself to figureout what we do.  Even though Y Combinator is now 3 years old, we\\'re stilltrying to understand its implications.)I was annoyed recently to read a description of Y Combinator thatsaid \"Y Combinator does seed funding for startups.\"  What wasespecially annoying about it was that I wrote it.  This doesn\\'treally convey what we do.  And the reason it\\'s inaccurate is that,paradoxically, funding very early stage startups is not mainly aboutfunding.Saying YC does seed funding for startups is a description in termsof earlier models.  It\\'s like calling a car a horseless carriage.When you scale animals you can\\'t just keep everything in proportion.For example, volume grows as the cube of linear dimension, butsurface area only as the square.  So as animals get bigger theyhave trouble radiating heat.  That\\'s why mice and rabbits are furryand elephants and hippos aren\\'t.  You can\\'t make a mouse by scalingdown an elephant.YC represents a new, smaller kind of animal—so much smallerthat all the rules are different.Before us, most companies in the startup funding business wereventure capital funds.  VCs generally fund later stage companiesthan we do.  And they supply so much money that, even though theother things they do may be very valuable, it\\'s not that inaccurateto regard VCs as sources of money.  Good VCs are \"smart money,\" butthey\\'re still money.All good investors supply a combination of money and help.  Butthese scale differently, just as volume and surface area do.  Latestage investors supply huge amounts of money andcomparatively little help: when a company about to go public getsa mezzanine round of $50 million, the deal tends to be almostentirely about money.  As you move earlier in the venturefunding process, the ratio of help to money increases, becauseearlier stage companies have different needs.  Early stage companiesneed less money because they\\'re smaller and cheaper to run, butthey need more help because life is so precarious for them.  Sowhen VCs do a series A round for, say, $2 million, they generallyexpect to offer a significant amount of help along with the money.Y Combinator occupies the earliest end of the spectrum.  We\\'re atleast one and generally two steps before VC funding.  (Though somestartups go straight from YC to VC, the most common trajectory isto do an angel round first.)  And what happens at Y Combinator isas different from what happens in a series A round as a series Around is from a mezzanine financing.At our end, money is almost a negligible factor.  The startup usuallyconsists of just the founders. Their living expenses are thecompany\\'s main expense, and since most founders are under 30, theirliving expenses are low.  But at this early stage companies need alot of help.  Practically every question is still unanswered.  Somecompanies we\\'ve funded have been working on their software for ayear or more, but others haven\\'t decided what to work on, or evenwho the founders should be.When PR people and journalists recount the histories of startupsafter they\\'ve become big, they always underestimate how uncertainthings were at first.  They\\'re not being deliberately misleading.When you look at a company like Google, it\\'s hard to imagine theycould once have been small and helpless.  Sure, at one point theywere a just a couple guys in a garage—but even then theirgreatness was assured, and all they had to do was roll forward alongthe railroad tracks of destiny.Far from it.  A lot of startups with just as promising beginningsend up failing.  Google has such momentum now that it would be hardfor anyone to stop them.  But all it would have taken in the beginningwould have been for two Google employees to focus on the wrongthings for six months, and the company could have died.We know, because we\\'ve been there, just how vulnerable startups arein the earliest phases.  Curiously enough, that\\'s why founders tendto get so rich from them.  Reward is always proportionate to risk,and very early stage startups are insanely risky.What we really do at Y Combinator is get startups launched straight.One of many metaphors you could use for YC is a steam catapult onan aircraft carrier.  We get startups airborne.  Barely airborne,but enough that they can accelerate fast.When you\\'re launching planes they have to be set up properly oryou\\'re just launching projectiles.  They have to be pointed straightdown the deck; the wings have to be trimmed properly; the engineshave to be at full power; the pilot has to be ready.  These are thekind of problems we deal with.  After we fund startups we workclosely with them for three months—so closely in fact thatwe insist they move to where we are.  And what we do in those threemonths is make sure everything is set up for launch.  If there aretensions between cofounders we help sort them out.  We get all thepaperwork set up properly so there are no nasty surprises later.If the founders aren\\'t sure what to focus on first, we try to figurethat out.  If there is some obstacle right in front of them, weeither try to remove it, or shift the startup sideways.  The goalis to get every distraction out of the way so the founders can usethat time to build (or finish building) something impressive.  Andthen near the end of the three months we push the button on thesteam catapult in the form of Demo Day, where the current group ofstartups present to pretty much every investor in Silicon Valley.Launching companies isn\\'t identical with launching products.  Thoughwe do spend a lot of time on launch strategies for products, thereare some things that take too long to build for a startup to launchthem before raising their next round of funding.  Several of themost promising startups we\\'ve funded haven\\'t launched their productsyet, but are definitely launched as companies.In the earliest stage, startups not only have more questions toanswer, but they tend to be different kinds of questions.  In laterstage startups the questions are about deals, or hiring, ororganization.  In the earliest phase they tend to be about technologyand design.  What do you make?  That\\'s the first problem to solve.That\\'s why our motto is \"Make something people want.\"  This isalways a good thing for companies to do, but it\\'s even more importantearly on, because it sets the bounds for every other question.  Whoyou hire, how much money you raise, how you market yourself—theyall depend on what you\\'re making.Because the early problems are so much about technology and design,you probably need to be hackers to do what we do.  While some VCshave technical backgrounds, I don\\'t know any who still write code.Their expertise is mostly in business—as it should be, becausethat\\'s the kind of expertise you need in the phase between seriesA and (if you\\'re lucky) IPO.We\\'re so different from VCs that we\\'re really a different kind ofanimal.  Can we claim founders are better off as a result of thisnew type of venture firm?  I\\'m pretty sure the answer is yes, becauseYC is an improved version of what happened to our startup, and ourcase was not atypical.  We started Viaweb with $10,000 in seed moneyfrom our friend Julian.  He was a lawyer and arranged all ourpaperwork, so we could just code.  We spent three months buildinga version 1, which we then presented to investors to raise moremoney.  Sounds familiar, doesn\\'t it?  But YC improves on thatsignificantly.  Julian knew a lot about law and business, but hisadvice ended there; he was not a startup guy.  So we made some basicmistakes early on.  And when we presented to investors, we presentedto only 2, because that was all we knew.  If we\\'d had our laterselves to encourage and advise us, and Demo Day to present at, wewould have been in much better shape.  We probably could have raisedmoney at 3 to 5 times the valuation we did.If we take 7% of a company we fund, the founders only have to do7.5%better in their next round of fundingto end up net ahead.  We certainly manage that.So who is our 7% coming out of?  If the founders end up net aheadit\\'s not coming out of them.  So is it coming out of later stageinvestors?  Well, they do end up paying more.  But I think they paymore because the company is actually more valuable.  And later stageinvestors have no problem with that.  The returns of a VC funddepend on the quality of the companies they invest in, not howcheaply they can buy stock in them.If what we do is useful, why wasn\\'t anyone doing it before?  Thereare two answers to that.  One is that people were doing it before,just haphazardly on a smaller scale.  Before us, seed funding cameprimarily from individual angel investors.  Larry and Sergey, forexample, got their seed funding from Andy Bechtolsheim, one of thefounders of Sun.  And because he was a startup guy he probably gavethem useful advice.  But raising money from angel investors is ahit or miss thing.  It\\'s a sideline for most of them, so they onlydo a handful of deals a year and they don\\'t spend a lot of time onthe startups they invest in.  And they\\'re hard to reach, becausethey don\\'t want random startups pestering them with business plans.The Google guys were lucky because they knew someone who knewBechtolsheim.  It generally takes a personal introduction withangels.The other reason no one was doing quite what we do is that tillrecently it was a lot more expensive to start a startup.  You\\'llnotice we haven\\'t funded any biotech startups.  That\\'s stillexpensive.  But advancing technology has made web startups so cheapthat you really can get a company airborne for $15,000.  If youunderstand how to operate a steam catapult, at least.So in effect what\\'s happened is that a new ecological niche hasopened up, and Y Combinator is the new kind of animal that has movedinto it.  We\\'re not a replacement for venture capital funds.  Weoccupy a new, adjacent niche.  And conditions in our niche arereally quite different.  It\\'s not just that the problems we faceare different; the whole structure of the business is different.VCs are playing a zero-sum game.  They\\'re all competing for a sliceof a fixed amount of \"deal flow,\" and that explains a lot of theirbehavior.  Whereas our m.o. is to create new deal flow, by encouraginghackers who would have gotten jobs to start their own startupsinstead.  We compete more with employers than VCs.It\\'s not surprising something like this would happen.  Most fieldsbecome more specialized—more articulated—as they develop,and startups are certainly an area in which there has been a lotof development over the past couple decades.  The venture businessin its present form is only about forty years old.  It stands toreason it would evolve.And it\\'s natural that the new niche would at first be described,even by its inhabitants, in terms of the old one.  But really YCombinator is not in the startup funding business.  Really we\\'remore of a small, furry steam catapult.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': \"When people say that in their experience all programming languagesare basically equivalent, they're making a statement not aboutlanguages but about the kind of programming they've done.99.5% of programming consists of gluing together calls to libraryfunctions. All popular languages are equally good at this. So onecan easily spend one's whole career operating in the intersectionof popular programming languages.But the other .5% of programming is disproportionately interesting.If you want to learn what it consists of, the weirdness of weirdlanguages is a good clue to follow.Weird languages aren't weird by accident. Not the good ones, atleast. The weirdness of the good ones usually implies the existenceof some form of programming that's not just the usual gluing togetherof library calls.A concrete example: Lisp macros. Lisp macros seem weird even tomany Lisp programmers. They're not only not in the intersection ofpopular languages, but by their nature would be hard to implementproperly in a language without turning it into a dialect ofLisp. And macros are definitely evidence of techniques that gobeyond glue programming. For example, solving problems by firstwriting a language for problems of that type, and then writingyour specific application in it. Nor is this all you can do withmacros; it's just one region in a space of program-manipulatingtechniques that even now is far from fully explored.So if you want to expand your concept of what programming can be,one way to do it is by learning weird languages. Pick a languagethat most programmers consider weird but whose median user is smart,and then focus on the differences between this language and theintersection of popular languages. What can you say in this languagethat would be impossibly inconvenient to say in others? In theprocess of learning how to say things you couldn't previously say,you'll probably be learning how to think things you couldn'tpreviously think.\"},\n",

       "  'date': 'January 2016',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'Life is short, as everyone knows. When I was a kid I used to wonderabout this. Is life actually short, or are we really complainingabout its finiteness?  Would we be just as likely to feel life wasshort if we lived 10 times as long?Since there didn\\'t seem any way to answer this question, I stoppedwondering about it.  Then I had kids.  That gave me a way to answerthe question, and the answer is that life actually is short.Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time,into discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 yearold.  If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you onlyget to watch your child experience it 8 times.  And while it\\'simpossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantitylike time, 8 is not a lot of something.  If you had a handful of 8peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity woulddefinitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.Ok, so life actually is short.  Does it make any difference to knowthat?It has for me.  It means arguments of the form \"Life is too shortfor x\" have great force.  It\\'s not just a figure of speech to saythat life is too short for something.  It\\'s not just a synonym forannoying.  If you find yourself thinking that life is too short forsomething, you should try to eliminate it if you can.When I ask myself what I\\'ve found life is too short for, the wordthat pops into my head is \"bullshit.\" I realize that answer issomewhat tautological.  It\\'s almost the definition of bullshit thatit\\'s the stuff that life is too short for.  And yet bullshit doeshave a distinctive character.  There\\'s something fake about it.It\\'s the junk food of experience.If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that\\'s bullshit,you probably already know the answer.  Unnecessary meetings, pointlessdisputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people\\'smistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it\\'seither forced on you, or it tricks you.  To some extent you have toput up with the bullshit forced on you by circumstances.  You needto make money, and making money consists mostly of errands.  Indeed,the law of supply and demand ensures that: the more rewarding somekind of work is, the cheaper people will do it.  It may be thatless bullshit is forced on you than you think, though.  There hasalways been a stream of people who opt out of the default grind andgo live somewhere where opportunities are fewer in the conventionalsense, but life feels more authentic.  This could become more common.You can do it on a smaller scale without moving.  The amount oftime you have to spend on bullshit varies between employers.  Mostlarge organizations (and many small ones) are steeped in it.  Butif you consciously prioritize bullshit avoidance over other factorslike money and prestige, you can probably find employers that willwaste less of your time.If you\\'re a freelancer or a small company, you can do this at thelevel of individual customers.  If you fire or avoid toxic customers,you can decrease the amount of bullshit in your life by more thanyou decrease your income.But while some amount of bullshit is inevitably forced on you, thebullshit that sneaks into your life by tricking you is no one\\'sfault but your own.  And yet the bullshit you choose may be harderto eliminate than the bullshit that\\'s forced on you.  Things thatlure you into wasting your time have to be really good attricking you.  An example that will be familiar to a lot of peopleis arguing online.  When someonecontradicts you, they\\'re in a sense attacking you. Sometimes prettyovertly.  Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself.  Butlike a lot of instincts, this one wasn\\'t designed for the world wenow live in.  Counterintuitive as it feels, it\\'s better most ofthe time not to defend yourself.  Otherwise these people are literallytaking your life.Arguing online is only incidentally addictive. There are moredangerous things than that. As I\\'ve written before, one byproductof technical progress is that things we like tend to becomemoreaddictive.  Which means we will increasingly have to make a consciouseffort to avoid addictions — to stand outside ourselves and ask \"isthis how I want to be spending my time?\"As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out thingsthat matter.  But different things matter to different people, andmost have to learn what matters to them.  A few are lucky and realizeearly on that they love math or taking care of animals or writing,and then figure out a way to spend a lot of time doing it.  Butmost people start out with a life that\\'s a mix of things thatmatter and things that don\\'t, and only gradually learn to distinguishbetween them.For the young especially, much of this confusion is induced by theartificial situations they find themselves in. In middle school andhigh school, what the other kids think of you seems the most importantthing in the world.  But when you ask adults what they got wrongat that age, nearly all say they cared too much what other kidsthought of them.One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to askyourself whether you\\'ll care about it in the future.  Fake stuffthat matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter.  That\\'show it tricks you.  The area under the curve is small, but its shapejabs into your consciousness like a pin.The things that matter aren\\'t necessarily the ones people wouldcall \"important.\"  Having coffee with a friend matters.  You won\\'tfeel later like that was a waste of time.One great thing about having small children is that they make youspend time on things that matter: them. They grab your sleeve asyou\\'re staring at your phone and say \"will you play with me?\" Andodds are that is in fact the bullshit-minimizing option.If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us bysurprise. And that is just what tends to happen.  You take thingsfor granted, and then they\\'re gone.  You think you can always writethat book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realizethe window has closed.  The saddest windows close when other peopledie. Their lives are short too.  After my mother died, I wished I\\'dspent more time with her.  I lived as if she\\'d always be there.And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion.  But anillusion it was. I think a lot of people make the same mistake Idid.The usual way to avoid being taken by surprise by something is tobe consciously aware of it.  Back when life was more precarious,people used to be aware of death to a degree that would now seem abit morbid.  I\\'m not sure why, but it doesn\\'t seem the right answerto be constantly reminding oneself of the grim reaper hovering ateveryone\\'s shoulder.  Perhaps a better solution is to look at theproblem from the other end. Cultivate a habit of impatience aboutthe things you most want to do. Don\\'t wait before climbing thatmountain or writing that book or visiting your mother.  You don\\'tneed to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn\\'t wait.Just don\\'t wait.I can think of two more things one does when one doesn\\'t have muchof something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has.  Bothmake sense here.How you live affects how long you live.  Most people could do better.Me among them.But you can probably get even more effect by paying closer attentionto the time you have.  It\\'s easy to let the days rush by.  The\"flow\" that imaginative people love so much has a darker cousinthat prevents you from pausing to savor life amid the daily slurryof errands and alarms.  One of the most striking things I\\'ve readwas not in a book, but the title of one: James Salter\\'sBurningthe Days.It is possible to slow time somewhat. I\\'ve gotten better at it.Kids help.  When you have small children, there are a lot of momentsso perfect that you can\\'t help noticing.It does help too to feel that you\\'ve squeezed everything out ofsome experience.  The reason I\\'m sad about my mother is not justthat I miss her but that I think of all the things we could havedone that we didn\\'t.  My oldest son will be 7 soon.  And while Imiss the 3 year old version of him, I at least don\\'t have any regretsover what might have been.  We had the best time a daddy and a 3year old ever had.Relentlessly prune bullshit, don\\'t wait to do things that matter,and savor the time you have.  That\\'s what you do when life is short.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'Trolls',\n",
       "  'date': 'February 2008',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'A user on Hacker News recently posted acommentthat set me thinking:Something about hacker culture that never really set well with  me was this — the nastiness. ... I just don\\'t understand why people  troll like they do.I\\'ve thought a lot over the last couple years about the problem oftrolls.  It\\'s an old one, as old as forums, butwe\\'re still just learning what the causes are and how to addressthem.There are two senses of the word \"troll.\"  In the original senseit meant someone, usually an outsider, who deliberately stirred upfights in a forum by saying controversial things.For example,someone who didn\\'t use a certain programming language might go toa forum for users of that language and make disparaging remarksabout it, then sit back and watch as people rose to the bait.  Thissort of trolling was in the nature of a practical joke, like lettinga bat loose in a room full of people.The definition then spread to people who behaved like assholes inforums, whether intentionally or not.  Now when people talk abouttrolls they usually mean this broader sense of the word.  Thoughin a sense this is historically inaccurate, it is in other waysmore accurate, because when someone is being an asshole it\\'s usuallyuncertain even in their own mind how much is deliberate.That is arguably one of the defining qualities of an asshole.I think trolling in the broader sense has four causes.  The mostimportant is distance.  People will say things in anonymous forumsthat they\\'d never dare say to someone\\'s face, just as they\\'ll dothings in cars that they\\'d never do as pedestrians — like tailgatepeople, or honk at them, or cut them off.Trolling tends to be particularly bad in forums related to computers,and I think that\\'s due to the kind of people you find there.  Mostof them (myself included) are more comfortable dealing with abstractideas than with people.  Hackers can be abrupt even in person.  Putthem on an anonymous forum, and the problem gets worse.The third cause of trolling is incompetence.  If you disagree withsomething, it\\'s easier to say \"you suck\" than to figure out andexplain exactly what you disagree with.  You\\'re also safe that wayfrom refutation.  In this respect trolling is a lot like graffiti.Graffiti happens at the intersection of ambition and incompetence:people want to make their mark on the world, but have no other wayto do it than literally making a mark on the world.The final contributing factor is the culture of the forum.  Trollsare like children (manyarechildren) in that they\\'re capable ofa wide range of behavior depending on what they think will betolerated.  In a place where rudeness isn\\'t tolerated, most can bepolite.  But vice versa as well.There\\'s a sort of Gresham\\'s Law of trolls: trolls are willing touse a forum with a lot of thoughtful people in it, but thoughtfulpeople aren\\'t willing to use a forum with a lot of trolls in it.Which means that once trolling takes hold, it tends to become thedominant culture.  That had already happened to Slashdot and Digg bythe time I paid attention to comment threads there, but I watchedit happen to Reddit.News.YCis, among other things, an experiment to see if this fatecan be avoided.  The sites\\'sguidelinesexplicitly ask people not to say things they wouldn\\'t say face toface.  If someone starts being rude, other users will step in andtell them to stop.  And when people seem to be deliberately trolling,we ban them ruthlessly.Technical tweaks may also help.  On Reddit, votes on your commentsdon\\'t affect your karma score, but they do on News.YC.  And it doesseem to influence people when they can see their reputation in theeyes of their peers drain away after making an asshole remark.Often users have second thoughts and delete such comments.One might worry this would prevent people from expressing controversialideas, but empirically that doesn\\'t seem to be what happens.  Whenpeople say something substantial that gets modded down, theystubbornly leave it up.  What people delete are wisecracks, becausethey have less invested in them.So far the experiment seems to be working.  The level of conversationon News.YC is as high as on any forum I\\'ve seen.  But we still onlyhave about 8,000 uniques a day.  The conversations on Reddit weregood when it was that small.  The challenge is whether we can keepthings this way.I\\'m optimistic we will.  We\\'re not depending just on technicaltricks.  The core users of News.YC are mostly refugees from othersites that were overrun by trolls.  They feel about trolls roughlythe way refugees from Cuba or Eastern Europe feel about dictatorships.So there are a lot of people working to keep this from happeningagain.'},\n",

Think about what it means to be biased.  Whatit means for a selection process to be biased against applicantsof type x is that it's harder for them to make it through.  Whichmeans applicants of type x have to be better to get selected thanapplicants not of type x.Which means applicants of type xwho do make it through the selection process will outperform othersuccessful applicants.  And if the performance of all the successfulapplicants is measured, you'll know if they do.Of course, the test you use to measure performance must be a validone.  And in particular it must not be invalidated by the bias you'retrying to measure.But there are some domains where performance can be measured, andin those detecting bias is straightforward. Want to know if theselection process was biased against some type of applicant?  Checkwhether they outperform the others.  This is not just a heuristicfor detecting bias.  It's what bias means.For example, many suspect that venture capital firms are biasedagainst female founders. This would be easy to detect: among theirportfolio companies, do startups with female founders outperformthose without?  A couple months ago, one VC firm (almost certainlyunintentionally) published a study showing bias of this type. FirstRound Capital found that among its portfolio companies, startupswith female foundersoutperformedthose without by 63%.The reason I began by saying that this technique would come as asurprise to many people is that we so rarely see analyses of thistype.  I'm sure it will come as a surprise to First Round that theyperformed one. I doubt anyone there realized that by limiting theirsample to their own portfolio, they were producing a study not ofstartup trends but of their own biases when selecting companies.I predict we'll see this technique used more in the future.  Theinformation needed to conduct such studies is increasingly available.Data about who applies for things is usually closely guarded by theorganizations selecting them, but nowadays data about who getsselected is often publicly available to anyone who takes the troubleto aggregate it.\"},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.March 2009A couple days ago I finally got being a good startup founder down\\rto two words:  relentlessly resourceful.Till then the best I\\'d managed was to get the opposite quality down\\rto one: hapless.  Most dictionaries say hapless means unlucky.  But\\rthe dictionaries are not doing a very good job.  A team that outplays\\rits opponents but loses because of a bad decision by the referee\\rcould be called unlucky, but not hapless.  Hapless implies passivity.\\rTo be hapless is to be battered by circumstances — to let the world\\rhave its way with you, instead of having your way with the world.Unfortunately there\\'s no antonym of hapless, which makes it difficult\\rto tell founders what to aim for.  \"Don\\'t be hapless\" is not much\\rof a rallying cry.It\\'s not hard to express the quality we\\'re looking for in metaphors.\\rThe best is probably a running back.  A good running back is not\\rmerely determined, but flexible as well.  They want to get downfield,\\rbut they adapt their plans on the fly.Unfortunately this is just a metaphor, and not a useful one to most\\rpeople outside the US.   \"Be like a running back\" is no better than\\r\"Don\\'t be hapless.\"But finally I\\'ve figured out how to express this quality directly.\\rI was writing a talk forinvestors, and I had to explain what to\\rlook for in founders.  What would someone who was the opposite of\\rhapless be like?  They\\'d be relentlessly resourceful.  Not merely\\rrelentless.  That\\'s not enough to make things go your way except\\rin a few mostly uninteresting domains.  In any interesting domain,\\rthe difficulties will be novel.  Which means you can\\'t simply plow\\rthrough them, because you don\\'t know initially how hard they are;\\ryou don\\'t know whether you\\'re about to plow through a block of foam\\ror granite.  So you have to be resourceful. You have to keep\\rtrying new things.Be relentlessly resourceful.That sounds right, but is it simply a description\\rof how to be successful in general?  I don\\'t think so.  This isn\\'t\\rthe recipe for success in writing or painting, for example.  In\\rthat kind of work the recipe is more to be actively curious.\\rResourceful implies the obstacles are external, which they generally\\rare in startups. But in writing and painting they\\'re mostly internal;\\rthe obstacle is your own obtuseness.There probably are other fields where \"relentlessly resourceful\"\\ris the recipe for success.  But though other fields may share it,\\rI think this is the best short description we\\'ll find of what makes\\ra good startup founder.  I doubt it could be made more precise.Now that we know what we\\'re looking for, that leads to other\\rquestions.  For example, can this quality be taught?  After four\\ryears of trying to teach it to people, I\\'d say that yes, surprisingly\\roften it can.  Not to everyone, but to many people.Some\\rpeople are just constitutionally passive, but others have a latent\\rability to be relentlessly resourceful that only needs to be brought\\rout.This is particularly true of young people who have till now always\\rbeen under the thumb of some kind of authority.  Being relentlessly\\rresourceful is definitely not the recipe for success in big companies,\\ror in most schools.  I don\\'t even want to think what the recipe is\\rin big companies, but it is certainly longer and messier, involving\\rsome combination of resourcefulness, obedience, and building\\ralliances.Identifying this quality also brings us closer to answering a\\rquestion people often wonder about: how many startups there could\\rbe.  There is not, as some people seem to think, any economic upper\\rbound on this number.  There\\'s no reason to believe there is any\\rlimit on the amount of newly created wealth consumers can absorb,\\rany more than there is a limit on the number of theorems that can\\rbe proven.  So probably the limiting factor on the number of startups\\ris the pool of potential founders.  Some people would make good\\rfounders, and others wouldn\\'t.  And now that we can say what makes\\ra good founder, we know how to put an upper bound on the size of\\rthe pool.This test is also useful to individuals.  If you want to know whether\\ryou\\'re the right sort of person to start a startup, ask yourself\\rwhether you\\'re relentlessly resourceful.  And if you want to know\\rwhether to recruit someone as a cofounder, ask if they are.You can even use it tactically.  If I were running a startup, this\\rwould be the phrase I\\'d tape to the mirror.  \"Make something people\\rwant\" is the destination, but \"Be relentlessly resourceful\" is how\\ryou get there.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.January 2012There are great startup ideas lying around unexploited right underour noses.  One reason we don\\'t see them is a phenomenon I callschlep blindness.  Schlep was originally a Yiddish word but haspassed into general use in the US.  It means a tedious, unpleasanttask.No one likes schleps, but hackers especially dislike them.  Most hackers who start startups wish they could do it by just writingsome clever software, putting it on a server somewhere, and watchingthe money roll in—without ever having to talk to users, or negotiatewith other companies, or deal with other people\\'s broken code.Maybe that\\'s possible, but I haven\\'t seen it.One of the many things we do at Y Combinator is teach hackers aboutthe inevitability of schleps.  No, you can\\'t start a startup byjust writing code.  I remember going through this realization myself.There was a point in 1995 when I was still trying to convince myselfI could start a company by just writing code.  But I soon learnedfrom experience that schleps are not merely inevitable, but prettymuch what business consists of.  A company is defined by the schlepsit will undertake.  And schleps should be dealt with the same wayyou\\'d deal with a cold swimming pool: just jump in.  Which is notto say you should seek out unpleasant work per se, but that youshould never shrink from it if it\\'s on the path to something great.The most dangerous thing about our dislike of schleps is that muchof it is unconscious.  Your unconscious won\\'t even let you see ideasthat involve painful schleps.  That\\'s schlep blindness.The phenomenon isn\\'t limited to startups.  Most people don\\'tconsciously decide not to be in as good physical shape as Olympicathletes, for example.  Their unconscious mind decides for them,shrinking from the work involved.The most striking example I know of schlep blindness isStripe, orrather Stripe\\'s idea.  For over a decade, every hacker who\\'d everhad to process payments online knew how painful the experience was.Thousands of people must have known about this problem.  And yetwhen they started startups, they decided to build recipe sites, oraggregators for local events.  Why?  Why work on problems few caremuch about and no one will pay for, when you could fix one of themost important components of the world\\'s infrastructure?  Becauseschlep blindness prevented people from even considering the ideaof fixing payments.Probably no one who applied to Y Combinator to work on a recipesite began by asking \"should we fix payments, or build a recipesite?\" and chose the recipe site.  Though the idea of fixing paymentswas right there in plain sight, they never saw it, because theirunconscious mind shrank from the complications involved.  You\\'dhave to make deals with banks.  How do you do that?  Plus you\\'removing money, so you\\'re going to have to deal with fraud, and peopletrying to break into your servers.  Plus there are probably allsorts of regulations to comply with.  It\\'s a lot more intimidatingto start a startup like this than a recipe site.That scariness makes ambitious ideas doubly valuable.  In additionto their intrinsic value, they\\'re like undervalued stocks in thesense that there\\'s less demand for them among founders.  If youpick an ambitious idea, you\\'ll have less competition, becauseeveryone else will have been frightened off by the challengesinvolved.  (This is also true of starting a startup generally.)How do you overcome schlep blindness?  Frankly, the most valuableantidote to schlep blindness is probably ignorance.  Most successfulfounders would probably say that if they\\'d known when they werestarting their company about the obstacles they\\'d have to overcome,they might never have started it.  Maybe that\\'s one reason the mostsuccessful startups of all so often have young founders.In practice the founders grow with the problems.  But no one seemsable to foresee that, not even older, more experienced founders.So the reason younger founders have an advantage is that they maketwo mistakes that cancel each other out.  They don\\'t know how muchthey can grow, but they also don\\'t know how much they\\'ll need to.Older founders only make the first mistake.Ignorance can\\'t solve everything though.  Some ideas so obviouslyentail alarming schleps that anyone can see them.  How do you seeideas like that?  The trick I recommend is to take yourself out ofthe picture.  Instead of asking \"what problem should I solve?\" ask\"what problem do I wish someone else would solve for me?\"  If someonewho had to process payments before Stripe had tried asking that,Stripe would have been one of the first things they wished for.It\\'s too late now to be Stripe, but there\\'s plenty still broken inthe world, if you know how to see it.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': '(This essay is derived from a talk atAngelConf.)When we sold our startup in 1998 I thought one day I\\'d do some angelinvesting.  Seven years later I still hadn\\'t started.  I put it offbecause it seemed mysterious and complicated.   It turns out to be easier than I expected, and also more interesting.The part I thought was hard, the mechanics of investing, reallyisn\\'t. You give a startup money and they give you stock.  You\\'llprobably get either preferred stock, which means stock with extrarights like getting your money back first in a sale, or convertibledebt, which means (on paper) you\\'re lending the company money, andthe debt converts to stock at the next sufficiently big fundinground.There are sometimes minor tactical advantages to using one or theother.  The paperwork for convertible debt is simpler.  But reallyit doesn\\'t matter much which you use.  Don\\'t spend much time worryingabout the details of deal terms, especially when you first startangel investing.  That\\'s not how you win at this game.  When youhear people talking about a successful angel investor, they\\'re notsaying \"He got a 4x liquidation preference.\" They\\'re saying \"Heinvested in Google.\"That\\'s how you win: by investing in the right startups.  That isso much more important than anything else that I worry I\\'m misleadingyou by even talking about other things.MechanicsAngel investors often syndicate deals, which means they join togetherto invest on the same terms.  In a syndicate there is usually a\"lead\" investor who negotiates the terms with the startup.  But notalways: sometimes the startup cobbles together a syndicate ofinvestors who approach them independently, and the startup\\'s lawyersupplies the paperwork.The easiest way to get started in angel investing is to find afriend who already does it, and try to get included in his syndicates.Then all you have to do is write checks.Don\\'t feel like you have to join a syndicate, though.  It\\'s not thathard to do it yourself.  You can just use the standardseries AAdocuments Wilson Sonsini and Y Combinator published online.You should of course have your lawyer review everything.  Both youand the startup should have lawyers.  But the lawyers don\\'t haveto create the agreement from scratch.When you negotiate terms with a startup, there are two numbers youcare about: how much money you\\'re putting in, and the valuation ofthe company.  The valuation determines how much stock you get.  Ifyou put $50,000 into a company at a pre-money valuation of $1million, then the post-money valuation is $1.05 million, and youget .05/1.05, or 4.76% of the company\\'s stock.If the company raises more money later, the new investor will takea chunk of the company away from all the existing shareholders justas you did.  If in the next round they sell 10% of the company toa new investor, your 4.76% will be reduced to 4.28%.That\\'s ok.  Dilution is normal.  What saves you from being mistreatedin future rounds, usually, is that you\\'re in the same boat as thefounders.  They can\\'t dilute you without diluting themselves justas much.  And they won\\'t dilute themselves unless they end upnet ahead.  So in theory, each further round of investment leaves youwith a smaller share of an even more valuable company, till afterseveral more rounds you end up with .5% of the company at the pointwhere it IPOs, and you are very happy because your $50,000 hasbecome $5 million.The agreement by which you invest should have provisions that let you contribute tofuture rounds to maintain your percentage.  So it\\'s your choicewhether you get diluted.If the company does really well,you eventually will, because eventually the valuations will get sohigh it\\'s not worth it for you.How much does an angel invest?  That varies enormously, from $10,000to hundreds of thousands or in rare cases even millions.  The upperbound is obviously the total amount the founders want to raise.The lower bound is 5-10% of the total or $10,000, whicheveris greater.  A typical angel round these days might be $150,000raised from 5 people.Valuations don\\'t vary as much.  For angel rounds it\\'s rare to seea valuation lower than half a million or higher than 4 or 5 million.4 million is starting to be VC territory.How do you decide what valuation to offer?  If you\\'re part of around led by someone else, that problem is solved for you.  Butwhat if you\\'re investing by yourself?  There\\'s no real answer.There is no rational way to value an early stage startup.  Thevaluation reflects nothing more than the strength of the company\\'sbargaining position.  If they really want you, either because theydesperately need money, or you\\'re someone who can help them a lot,they\\'ll let you invest at a low valuation.  If they don\\'t need you,it will be higher.  So guess.  The startup may not have any moreidea what the number should be than you do.Ultimately it doesn\\'t matter much.  When angels make a lot of moneyfrom a deal, it\\'s not because they invested at a valuation of $1.5million instead of $3 million.  It\\'s because the company was reallysuccessful.I can\\'t emphasize that too much.  Don\\'t get hung up on mechanicsor deal terms.  What you should spend your time thinking about iswhether the company is good.(Similarly, founders also should not get hung up on dealterms, but should spend their time thinking about how to make thecompany good.)There\\'s a second less obvious component of an angel investment: howmuch you\\'re expected to help the startup.  Like the amount youinvest, this can vary a lot.  You don\\'t have to do anything if youdon\\'t want to; you could simply be a source of money.  Or you canbecome a de facto employee of the company.  Just make sure that youand the startup agree in advance about roughly how much you\\'ll dofor them.Really hot companies sometimes have high standards for angels.  Theones everyone wants to invest in practically audition investors,and only take money from people who are famous and/or will workhard for them.  But don\\'t feel like you have to put in a lot oftime or you won\\'t get to invest in any good startups.  There is asurprising lack of correlation between how hot a deal a startup isand how well it ends up doing.  Lots of hot startups will end upfailing, and lots of startups no one likes will end up succeeding.And the latter are so desperate for money that they\\'ll take it fromanyone at a low valuation.Picking WinnersIt would be nice to be able to pick those out, wouldn\\'t it?  Thepart of angel investing that has most effect on your returns, pickingthe right companies, is also the hardest.  So you should practicallyignore (or more precisely, archive, in the Gmail sense) everythingI\\'ve told you so far.  You may need to refer to it at some point,but it is not the central issue.The central issue is picking the right startups.  What \"Make somethingpeople want\" is for startups, \"Pick the right startups\" is forinvestors.  Combined they yield \"Pick the startups that will makesomething people want.\"How do you do that?  It\\'s not as simple as picking startups thatare already making something wildly popular.  By then it\\'stoo late for angels.  VCs will already be onto them.  As an angel,you have to pick startups before they\\'ve got a hit—eitherbecause they\\'ve made something great but users don\\'t realize ityet, like Google early on, or because they\\'re still an iterationor two away from the big hit, like Paypal when they were makingsoftware for transferring money between PDAs.To be a good angel investor, you have to be a good judge of potential.That\\'s what it comes down to.  VCs can be fast followers.  Most ofthem don\\'t try to predict what will win.  They just try to noticequickly when something already is winning.  But angels have to beable to predict.One interesting consequence of this fact is that there are a lotof people out there who have never even made an angel investmentand yet are already better angel investors than they realize.Someone who doesn\\'t know the first thing about the mechanics ofventure funding but knows what a successful startup founder lookslike is actually far ahead of someone who knows termsheets insideout, but thinks\"hacker\"means someone who breaks into computers.If you can recognize good startup founders by empathizing withthem—if you both resonate at the same frequency—thenyou may already be a better startup picker than the median professionalVC.Paul Buchheit, for example, started angel investing about a yearafter me, and he was pretty much immediately as good as me at pickingstartups.  My extra year of experience was rounding error comparedto our ability to empathize with founders.What makes a good founder?  If there were a word that meant theopposite of hapless, that would be the one.  Bad founders seemhapless.  They may be smart, or not, but somehow events overwhelmthem and they get discouraged and give up.  Good founders makethings happen the way they want.  Which is not to say they forcethings to happen in a predefined way.  Good founders have a healthyrespect for reality.  But they are relentlessly resourceful.  That\\'sthe closest I can get to the opposite of hapless.  You want to fundpeople who are relentlessly resourceful.Notice we started out talking about things, and now we\\'re talkingabout people.  There is an ongoing debate between investors whichis more important, the people, or the idea—or more precisely,the market. Some, like Ron Conway, say it\\'s the people—thatthe idea will change, but the people are the foundation of thecompany.  Whereas Marc Andreessen says he\\'d back ok founders in ahot market over great founders in a bad one.These two positions are not so far apart as they seem, because goodpeople find good markets.  Bill Gates would probably have ended uppretty rich even if IBM hadn\\'t happened to drop the PC standard inhis lap.I\\'ve thought a lot about the disagreement between the investors whoprefer to bet on people and those who prefer to bet on markets.It\\'s kind of surprising that it even exists.  You\\'d expect opinionsto have converged more.But I think I\\'ve figured out what\\'s going on.  The three mostprominent people I know who favor markets are Marc, Jawed Karim,and Joe Kraus.  And all three of them, in their own startups,basically flew into a thermal: they hit a market growing so fastthat it was all they could do to keep up with it.  That kind ofexperience is hard to ignore.  Plus I think they underestimatethemselves: they think back to how easy it felt to ride that hugethermal upward, and they think \"anyone could have done it.\"  Butthat isn\\'t true; they are not ordinary people.So as an angel investor I think you want to go with Ron Conway andbet on people.  Thermals happen, yes, but no one can predictthem—not even the founders, and certainly not you as aninvestor.  And only good people can ride the thermals if they hitthem anyway.Deal FlowOf course the question of how to choose startups presumes youhave startups to choose between.  How do you find them?  This isyet another problem that gets solved for you by syndicates.  If youtag along on a friend\\'s investments, you don\\'t have to find startups.The problem is not finding startups, exactly, but finding a streamof reasonably high quality ones.  The traditional way to do thisis through contacts.  If you\\'re friends with a lot of investors andfounders, they\\'ll send deals your way.  The Valley basically runson referrals.  And once you start to become known as reliable,useful investor, people will refer lots of deals to you.  I certainlywill.There\\'s also a newer way to find startups, which is to come toevents like Y Combinator\\'s Demo Day, where a batch of newly createdstartups presents to investors all at once.   We have two Demo Daysa year, one in March and one in August.  These are basically massreferrals.But events like Demo Day only account for a fraction of matchesbetween startups and investors.  The personal referral is still themost common route.  So if you want to hear about new startups, thebest way to do it is to get lots of referrals.The best way to get lots of referrals is to invest in startups.  Nomatter how smart and nice you seem, insiders will be reluctant tosend you referrals until you\\'ve proven yourself by doing a coupleinvestments.  Some smart, nice guys turn out to be flaky,high-maintenance investors. But once you prove yourself as a goodinvestor, the deal flow, as they call it, will increase rapidly inboth quality and quantity.  At the extreme, for someone like RonConway, it is basically identical with the deal flow of the wholeValley.So if you want to invest seriously, the way to get started is tobootstrap yourself off your existing connections, be a good investorin the startups you meet that way, and eventually you\\'ll start achain reaction.  Good investors are rare, even in Silicon Valley.There probably aren\\'t more than a couple hundred serious angels in the wholeValley, and yet they\\'re probably the single most important ingredientin making the Valley what it is.  Angels are the limiting reagentin startup formation.If there are only a couple hundred serious angels in the Valley, then by deciding to become one you could single-handedly make the pipelinefor startups in Silicon Valley significantly wider.  That is kindof mind-blowing.Being GoodHow do you be a good angel investor?  The first thing you need isto be decisive.  When we talk to founders about good and badinvestors, one of the ways we describe the good ones is to say \"hewrites checks.\" That doesn\\'t mean the investor says yes to everyone.Far from it.  It means he makes up his mind quickly,and follows through.  You may be thinking, how hard could that be?You\\'ll see when you try it.  It follows from the nature of angelinvesting that the decisions are hard.  You have to guess early,at the stage when the most promising ideas still seem counterintuitive,because if they were obviously good, VCs would already have fundedthem.Suppose it\\'s 1998.  You come across a startup founded by a couplegrad students.  They say they\\'re going to work on Internet search.There are already a bunch of big public companies doing search.How can these grad students possibly compete with them?  And doessearch even matter anyway?  All the search engines are trying toget people to start calling them \"portals\" instead.  Why would youwant to invest in a startup run by a couple of nobodies who aretrying to compete with large, aggressive companies in an area theythemselves have declared passe?  And yet the grad students seempretty smart.  What do you do?There\\'s a hack for being decisive when you\\'re inexperienced: ratchetdown the size of your investment till it\\'s an amount you wouldn\\'tcare too much about losing.  For every rich person (you probablyshouldn\\'t try angel investing unless you think of yourself as rich)there\\'s some amount that would be painless, though annoying, tolose.  Till you feel comfortable investing, don\\'t invest more thanthat per startup.For example, if you have $5 million in investable assets, it wouldprobably be painless (though annoying) to lose $15,000.  That\\'sless than .3% of your net worth.  So start by making 3 or 4 $15,000investments.  Nothing will teach you about angel investing likeexperience.  Treat the first few as an educational expense.  $60,000is less than a lot of graduate programs.  Plus you get equity.What\\'s really uncool is to be strategically indecisive: to stringfounders along while trying to gather more information about thestartup\\'s trajectory.There\\'s always a temptation to do that,because you just have so little to go on, but you have to consciouslyresist it.  In the long term it\\'s to your advantage to be good.The other component of being a good angel investor is simply to bea good person.  Angel investing is not a business where you makemoney by screwing people over.  Startups create wealth, andcreating wealth is not a zero sum game.  No one has to lose for youto win.  In fact, if you mistreat the founders you invest in, they\\'lljust get demoralized and the company will do worse.  Plus yourreferrals will dry up.  So I recommend being good.The most successful angel investors I know are all basically goodpeople.  Once they invest in a company, all they want to do is helpit.  And they\\'ll help people they haven\\'t invested in too.  Whenthey do favors they don\\'t seem to keep track of them.  It\\'s toomuch overhead.  They just try to help everyone, and assume goodthings will flow back to them somehow. Empirically that seems towork.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.March 2007(This essay is derived from talks at the 2007 Startup School and the Berkeley CSUA.)We\\'ve now been doing Y Combinator long enough to have some dataabout success rates.  Our first batch, in the summer of 2005, hadeight startups in it.  Of those eight, it now looks as if at leastfour succeeded.  Three have been acquired:Redditwas a merger oftwo, Reddit and Infogami, and a third was acquired that we can\\'ttalk about yet.  Another from that batch wasLoopt, which is doingso well they could probably be acquired in about ten minutes ifthey wanted to.So about half the founders from that first summer, less than twoyears ago, are now rich, at least by their standards.  (One thingyou learn when you get rich is that there are many degrees of it.)I\\'m not ready to predict our success rate will stay as high as 50%.That first batch could have been an anomaly.  But we should be ableto do better than the oft-quoted (and probably madeup) standard figure of 10%.  I\\'d feel safe aiming at 25%.Even the founders who fail don\\'t seem to have such a bad time.  Ofthose first eight startups, three are now probably dead.  In twocases the founders just went on to do other things at the end ofthe summer.   I don\\'t think they were traumatized by the experience.The closest to a traumatic failure was Kiko, whose founders keptworking on their startup for a whole year before being squashed byGoogle Calendar.  But they ended up happy.  They sold their softwareon eBay for a quarter of a million dollars.  After they paid backtheir angel investors, they had about a year\\'s salary each.Then they immediately went on to start a new and much more excitingstartup,Justin.TV.So here is an even more striking statistic: 0% of that first batchhad a terrible experience.  They had ups and downs, like everystartup, but I don\\'t think any would have traded it for a job in acubicle.  And that statistic is probably not an anomaly.  Whateverour long-term success rate ends up being, I think the rate of peoplewho wish they\\'d gotten a regular job will stay close to 0%.The big mystery to me is: why don\\'t more people start startups?  Ifnearly everyone who does it prefers it to a regular job, and asignificant percentage get rich, why doesn\\'t everyone want to dothis?  A lot of people think we get thousands of applications foreach funding cycle.  In fact we usually only get several hundred.Why don\\'t more people apply?  And while it must seem to anyonewatching this world that startups are popping up like crazy, thenumber is small compared to the number of people with the necessaryskills.  The great majority of programmers still go straight fromcollege to cubicle, and stay there.It seems like people are not acting in their own interest.  What\\'sgoing on?   Well, I can answer that.  Because of Y Combinator\\'sposition at the very start of the venture funding process, we\\'reprobably the world\\'s leading experts on the psychology of peoplewho aren\\'t sure if they want to start a company.There\\'s nothing wrong with being unsure.  If you\\'re a hacker thinkingabout starting a startup and hesitating before taking the leap,you\\'re part of a grand tradition.  Larry and Sergey seem to havefelt the same before they started Google, and so did Jerry and Filobefore they started Yahoo.  In fact, I\\'d guess the most successfulstartups are the ones started by uncertain hackers rather thangung-ho business guys.We have some evidence to support this.  Several of the most successfulstartups we\\'ve funded told us later that they only decided to applyat the last moment.  Some decided only hours before the deadline.The way to deal with uncertainty is to analyze it into components.Most people who are reluctant to do something have about eightdifferent reasons mixed together in their heads, and don\\'t knowthemselves which are biggest.  Some will be justified and somebogus, but unless you know the relative proportion of each, youdon\\'t know whether your overall uncertainty is mostly justified ormostly bogus.So I\\'m going to list all the components of people\\'s reluctance tostart startups, and explain which are real.  Then would-be founderscan use this as a checklist to examine their own feelings.I admit my goal is to increase your self-confidence.  But there aretwo things different here from the usual confidence-building exercise.One is that I\\'m motivated to be honest.  Most people in theconfidence-building business have already achieved their goal whenyou buy the book or pay to attend the seminar where they tell youhow great you are.  Whereas if I encourage people to start startupswho shouldn\\'t, I make my own life worse.  If I encourage too manypeople to apply to Y Combinator, it just means more work for me,because I have to read all the applications.The other thing that\\'s going to be different is my approach.  Insteadof being positive, I\\'m going to be negative.  Instead of tellingyou \"come on, you can do it\" I\\'m going to consider all the reasonsyou aren\\'t doing it, and show why most (but not all) should beignored.  We\\'ll start with the one everyone\\'s born with.1. Too youngA lot of people think they\\'re too young to start a startup.  Manyare right.  The median age worldwide is about 27, so probably athird of the population can truthfully say they\\'re too young.What\\'s too young?  One of our goals with Y Combinator was to discoverthe lower bound on the age of startup founders.  It always seemedto us that investors were too conservative here—that they wantedto fund professors, when really they should be funding grad studentsor even undergrads.The main thing we\\'ve discovered from pushing the edge of thisenvelope is not where the edge is, but how fuzzy it is.  The outerlimit may be as low as 16.  We don\\'t look beyond 18 because peopleyounger than that can\\'t legally enter into contracts.  But the mostsuccessful founder we\\'ve funded so far, Sam Altman, was 19 at thetime.Sam Altman, however, is an outlying data point.  When he was 19,he seemed like he had a 40 year old inside him.  There are other19 year olds who are 12 inside.There\\'s a reason we have a distinct word \"adult\" for people over acertain age.  There is a threshold you cross.  It\\'s conventionallyfixed at 21, but different people cross it at greatly varying ages.You\\'re old enough to start a startup if you\\'ve crossed this threshold,whatever your age.How do you tell?  There are a couple tests adults use.  I realizedthese tests existed after meeting Sam Altman, actually.  I noticedthat I felt like I was talking to someone much older.  Afterward Iwondered, what am I even measuring?  What made him seem older?One test adults use is whether you still have the kid flake reflex.When you\\'re a little kid and you\\'re asked to do something hard, youcan cry and say \"I can\\'t do it\" and the adults will probably letyou off.  As a kid there\\'s a magic button you can press by saying\"I\\'m just a kid\" that will get you out of most difficult situations.Whereas adults, by definition, are not allowed to flake.  They stilldo, of course, but when they do they\\'re ruthlessly pruned.The other way to tell an adult is by how they react to a challenge.Someone who\\'s not yet an adult will tend to respond to a challengefrom an adult in a way that acknowledges their dominance.  If anadult says \"that\\'s a stupid idea,\" a kid will either crawl awaywith his tail between his legs, or rebel.  But rebelling presumesinferiority as much as submission.  The adult response to\"that\\'s a stupid idea,\" is simply to look the other person in theeye and say \"Really?  Why do you think so?\"There are a lot of adults who still react childishly to challenges,of course.  What you don\\'t often find are kids who react to challengeslike adults.  When you do, you\\'ve found an adult, whatever theirage.2. Too inexperiencedI once wrote that startup founders should be at least 23, and thatpeople should work for another company for a few years beforestarting their own.  I no longer believe that, and what changed mymind is the example of the startups we\\'ve funded.I still think 23 is a better age than 21.  But the best way to getexperience if you\\'re 21 is to start a startup.  So, paradoxically,if you\\'re too inexperienced to start a startup, what you should dois start one.  That\\'s a way more efficient cure for inexperiencethan a normal job.  In fact, getting a normal job may actually makeyou less able to start a startup, by turning you into a tame animalwho thinks he needs an office to work in and a product manager totell him what software to write.What really convinced me of this was the Kikos.  They started astartup right out of college.  Their inexperience caused them tomake a lot of mistakes.  But by the time we funded their secondstartup, a year later, they had become extremely formidable.  Theywere certainly not tame animals.  And there is no way they\\'d havegrown so much if they\\'d spent that year working at Microsoft, oreven Google.  They\\'d still have been diffident junior programmers.So now I\\'d advise people to go ahead and start startups right outof college.  There\\'s no better time to take risks than when you\\'reyoung.  Sure, you\\'ll probably fail.  But even failure will get youto the ultimate goal faster than getting a job.It worries me a bit to be saying this, because in effect we\\'readvising people to educate themselves by failing at our expense,but it\\'s the truth.3. Not determined enoughYou need a lot of determination to succeed as a startup founder.It\\'s probably the single best predictor of success.Some people may not be determined enough to make it.  It\\'shard for me to say for sure, because I\\'m so determined that I can\\'timagine what\\'s going on in the heads of people who aren\\'t.  But Iknow they exist.Most hackers probably underestimate their determination.  I\\'ve seena lot become visibly more determined as they get used to running a startup.  I can think ofseveral we\\'ve funded who would have been delighted at first to bebought for $2 million, but are now set on world domination.How can you tell if you\\'re determined enough, when Larry and Sergeythemselves were unsure at first about starting a company?  I\\'mguessing here, but I\\'d say the test is whether you\\'re sufficientlydriven to work on your own projects.  Though they may have beenunsure whether they wanted to start a company, it doesn\\'t seem asif Larry and Sergey were meek little research assistants, obedientlydoing their advisors\\' bidding.  They started projects of their own.4. Not smart enoughYou may need to be moderately smart to succeed as a startup founder.But if you\\'re worried about this, you\\'re probably mistaken.  Ifyou\\'re smart enough to worry that you might not be smart enough tostart a startup, you probably are.And in any case, starting a startup just doesn\\'t require that muchintelligence.  Some startups do.  You have to be good at math towrite Mathematica.  But most companies do more mundane stuff wherethe decisive factor is effort, not brains.  Silicon Valley can warpyour perspective on this, because there\\'s a cult of smartness here.People who aren\\'t smart at least try to act that way.  But if youthink it takes a lot of intelligence to get rich, try spending acouple days in some of the fancier bits of New York or LA.If you don\\'t think you\\'re smart enough to start a startup doingsomething technically difficult, just write enterprise software.Enterprise software companies aren\\'t technology companies, they\\'resales companies, and sales depends mostly on effort.5. Know nothing about businessThis is another variable whose coefficient should be zero.  Youdon\\'t need to know anything about business to start a startup.  Theinitial focus should be the product.  All you need to know in thisphase is how to build things people want.  If you succeed, you\\'llhave to think about how to make money from it.  But this is so easyyou can pick it up on the fly.I get a fair amount of flak for telling founders just to makesomething great and not worry too much about making money.  And yetall the empirical evidence points that way: pretty much 100% ofstartups that make something popular manage to make money from it.And acquirers tell me privately that revenue is not what they buystartups for, but their strategic value.  Which means, because theymade something people want.  Acquirers know the rule holds for themtoo: if users love you, you can always make money from that somehow,and if they don\\'t, the cleverest business model in the world won\\'tsave you.So why do so many people argue with me?  I think one reason is thatthey hate the idea that a bunch of twenty year olds could get richfrom building something cool that doesn\\'t make any money.  Theyjust don\\'t want that to be possible.  But how possible it is doesn\\'tdepend on how much they want it to be.For a while it annoyed me to hear myself described as some kind ofirresponsible pied piper, leading impressionable young hackers downthe road to ruin.  But now I realize this kind of controversy is asign of a good idea.The most valuable truths are the ones most people don\\'t believe.They\\'re like undervalued stocks.  If you start with them, you\\'llhave the whole field to yourself.  So when you find an idea youknow is good but most people disagree with, you should notmerely ignore their objections, but push aggressively in thatdirection.  In this case, that means you should seek out ideas thatwould be popular but seem hard to make money from.We\\'ll bet a seed round you can\\'t make something popular that wecan\\'t figure out how to make money from.6. No cofounderNot having a cofounder is a real problem.  A startup is too muchfor one person to bear.  And though we differ from other investorson a lot of questions, we all agree on this.  All investors, withoutexception, are more likely to fund you with a cofounder than without.We\\'ve funded two single founders, but in both cases we suggestedtheir first priority should be to find a cofounder.  Both did.  Butwe\\'d have preferred them to have cofounders before they applied.It\\'s not super hard to get a cofounder for a project that\\'s justbeen funded, and we\\'d rather have cofounders committed enough tosign up for something super hard.If you don\\'t have a cofounder, what should you do?  Get one.  It\\'smore important than anything else.  If there\\'s no one where youlive who wants to start a startup with you, move where there arepeople who do.  If no one wants to work with you on your currentidea, switch to an idea people want to work on.If you\\'re still in school, you\\'re surrounded by potential cofounders.A few years out it gets harder to find them.  Not only do you havea smaller pool to draw from, but most already have jobs, and perhapseven families to support.  So if you had friends in college youused to scheme about startups with, stay in touch with them as wellas you can.  That may help keep the dream alive.It\\'s possible you could meet a cofounder through something like auser\\'s group or a conference.  But I wouldn\\'t be too optimistic.You need to work with someone to know whether you want them as acofounder.The real lesson to draw from this is not how to find a cofounder,but that you should start startups when you\\'re young and there arelots of them around.7. No ideaIn a sense, it\\'s not a problem if you don\\'t have a good idea, becausemost startups change their idea anyway.  In the average Y Combinatorstartup, I\\'d guess 70% of the idea is new at the end of thefirst three months.  Sometimes it\\'s 100%.In fact, we\\'re so sure the founders are more important than theinitial idea that we\\'re going to try something new this fundingcycle. We\\'re going to let people apply with no idea at all.  If youwant, you can answer the question on the application form that askswhat you\\'re going to do with \"We have no idea.\"  If you seem reallygood we\\'ll accept you anyway.  We\\'re confident we can sit down withyou and cook up some promising project.Really this just codifies what we do already.  We put little weighton the idea.  We ask mainly out of politeness.  The kind of questionon the application form that we really care about is the one wherewe ask what cool things you\\'ve made.  If what you\\'ve made is versionone of a promising startup, so much the better, but the main thingwe care about is whether you\\'re good at making things.  Being leaddeveloper of a popular open source project counts almost as much.That solves the problem if you get funded by Y Combinator.  Whatabout in the general case?  Because in another sense, it is a problemif you don\\'t have an idea.  If you start a startup with no idea,what do you do next?So here\\'s the brief recipe for getting startup ideas.  Find somethingthat\\'s missing in your own life, and supply that need—no matterhow specific to you it seems.  Steve Wozniak built himself a computer;who knew so many other people would want them?  A need that\\'s narrowbut genuine is a better starting point than one that\\'s broad buthypothetical.  So even if the problem is simply that you don\\'t havea date on Saturday night, if you can think of a way to fix that bywriting software, you\\'re onto something, because a lot of otherpeople have the same problem.8. No room for more startupsA lot of people look at the ever-increasing number of startups andthink \"this can\\'t continue.\"  Implicit in their thinking is afallacy: that there is some limit on the number of startups therecould be.  But this is false.  No one claims there\\'s any limit onthe number of people who can work for salary at 1000-person companies.Why should there be any limit on the number who can work for equityat 5-person companies?Nearly everyone who works is satisfying some kind of need.  Breakingup companies into smaller units doesn\\'t make those needs go away.Existing needs would probably get satisfied more efficiently by anetwork of startups than by a few giant, hierarchical organizations,but I don\\'t think that would mean less opportunity, because satisfyingcurrent needs would lead to more.  Certainly this tends to be thecase in individuals.  Nor is there anything wrong with that.  Wetake for granted things that medieval kings would have consideredeffeminate luxuries, like whole buildings heated to spring temperaturesyear round.  And if things go well, our descendants will take forgranted things we would consider shockingly luxurious.  There isno absolute standard for material wealth.  Health care is a componentof it, and that alone is a black hole.  For the foreseeable future,people will want ever more material wealth, so there is no limitto the amount of work available for companies, and for startups inparticular.Usually the limited-room fallacy is not expressed directly.  Usuallyit\\'s implicit in statements like \"there are only so many startupsGoogle, Microsoft, and Yahoo can buy.\"  Maybe, though the list ofacquirers is a lot longer than that.  And whatever you think ofother acquirers, Google is not stupid.  The reason big companiesbuy startups is that they\\'ve created something valuable.  And whyshould there be any limit to the number of valuable startups companiescan acquire, any more than there is a limit to the amount of wealthindividual people want?  Maybe there would be practical limits onthe number of startups any one acquirer could assimilate, but ifthere is value to be had, in the form of upside that founders arewilling to forgo in return for an immediate payment, acquirers willevolve to consume it.  Markets are pretty smart that way.9. Family to supportThis one is real.  I wouldn\\'t advise anyone with a family to starta startup.  I\\'m not saying it\\'s a bad idea, just that I don\\'t wantto take responsibility for advising it.  I\\'m willing to takeresponsibility for telling 22 year olds to start startups.  So whatif they fail?  They\\'ll learn a lot, and that job at Microsoft willstill be waiting for them if they need it.  But I\\'m not preparedto cross moms.What you can do, if you have a family and want to start a startup,is start a consulting business you can then gradually turn into aproduct business.  Empirically the chances of pulling that off seemvery small. You\\'re never going to produce Google this way.  But atleast you\\'ll never be without an income.Another way to decrease the risk is to join an existing startupinstead of starting your own.  Being one of the first employees ofa startup is a lot like being a founder, in both the good ways andthe bad.  You\\'ll be roughly 1/n^2 founder, where n is your employeenumber.As with the question of cofounders, the real lesson here is to startstartups when you\\'re young.10. Independently wealthyThis is my excuse for not starting a startup.  Startups are stressful.Why do it if you don\\'t need the money?  For every \"serial entrepreneur,\"there are probably twenty sane ones who think \"Start anothercompany?  Are you crazy?\"I\\'ve come close to starting new startups a couple times, but Ialways pull back because I don\\'t want four years of my life to beconsumed by random schleps.  I know this business well enough toknow you can\\'t do it half-heartedly.  What makes a good startupfounder so dangerous is his willingness to endure infinite schleps.There is a bit of a problem with retirement, though.  Like a lotof people, I like to work.  And one of the many weird little problemsyou discover when you get rich is that a lot of the interestingpeople you\\'d like to work with are not rich.  They need to work atsomething that pays the bills.  Which means if you want to havethem as colleagues, you have to work at something that pays thebills too, even though you don\\'t need to.  I think this is whatdrives a lot of serial entrepreneurs, actually.That\\'s why I love working on Y Combinator so much.  It\\'s an excuseto work on something interesting with people I like.11.  Not ready for commitmentThis was my reason for not starting a startup for most of my twenties.Like a lot of people that age, I valued freedom most of all.  I wasreluctant to do anything that required a commitment of more than afew months.  Nor would I have wanted to do anything that completelytook over my life the way a startup does.  And that\\'s fine.  If youwant to spend your time travelling around, or playing in a band,or whatever, that\\'s a perfectly legitimate reason not to start acompany.If you start a startup that succeeds, it\\'s going to consume at leastthree or four years.  (If it fails, you\\'ll be done a lot quicker.)So you shouldn\\'t do it if you\\'re not ready for commitments on thatscale.  Be aware, though, that if you get a regular job, you\\'llprobably end up working there for as long as a startup would take,and you\\'ll find you have much less spare time than you might expect.So if you\\'re ready to clip on that ID badge and go to that orientationsession, you may also be ready to start that startup.12.  Need for structureI\\'m told there are people who need structure in their lives.  Thisseems to be a nice way of saying they need someone to tell themwhat to do.  I believe such people exist.  There\\'s plenty of empiricalevidence: armies, religious cults, and so on.  They may even be themajority.If you\\'re one of these people, you probably shouldn\\'t start astartup.  In fact, you probably shouldn\\'t even go to work for one.In a good startup, you don\\'t get told what to do very much.  Theremay be one person whose job title is CEO, but till the company hasabout twelve people no one should be telling anyone what to do.That\\'s too inefficient.  Each person should just do what they needto without anyone telling them.If that sounds like a recipe for chaos, think about a soccer team.Eleven people manage to work together in quite complicated ways,and yet only in occasional emergencies does anyone tell anyone elsewhat to do.  A reporter once asked David Beckham if there were anylanguage problems at Real Madrid, since the players were from abouteight different countries.  He said it was never an issue, becauseeveryone was so good they never had to talk.  They all just did theright thing.How do you tell if you\\'re independent-minded enough to start astartup?  If you\\'d bristle at the suggestion that you aren\\'t, thenyou probably are.13. Fear of uncertaintyPerhaps some people are deterred from starting startups becausethey don\\'t like the uncertainty.  If you go to work for Microsoft,you can predict fairly accurately what the next few years will belike—all too accurately, in fact.  If you start a startup, anythingmight happen.Well, if you\\'re troubled by uncertainty, I can solve that problemfor you: if you start a startup, it will probably fail.  Seriously, though, this is not a bad way to thinkabout the whole experience.  Hope for the best, but expect theworst.  In the worst case, it will at least be interesting.  In thebest case you might get rich.No one will blame you if the startup tanks, so long as you made aserious effort.  There may once have been a time when employerswould regard that as a mark against you, but they wouldn\\'t now.  Iasked managers at big companies, and they all said they\\'d preferto hire someone who\\'d tried to start a startup and failed oversomeone who\\'d spent the same time working at a big company.Nor will investors hold it against you, as long as you didn\\'t failout of laziness or incurable stupidity.   I\\'m told there\\'s a lotof stigma attached to failing in other places—in Europe, forexample.  Not here.  In America, companies, like practicallyeverything else, are disposable.14. Don\\'t realize what you\\'re avoidingOne reason people who\\'ve been out in the world for a year or twomake better founders than people straight from college is that theyknow what they\\'re avoiding.  If their startup fails, they\\'ll haveto get a job, and they know how much jobs suck.If you\\'ve had summer jobs in college, you may think you know whatjobs are like, but you probably don\\'t.  Summer jobs at technologycompanies are not real jobs.  If you get a summer job as a waiter,that\\'s a real job.  Then you have to carry your weight.  But softwarecompanies don\\'t hire students for the summer as a source of cheaplabor.  They do it in the hope of recruiting them when they graduate.So while they\\'re happy if you produce, they don\\'t expect you to.That will change if you get a real job after you graduate.  Thenyou\\'ll have to earn your keep.  And since most of what big companiesdo is boring, you\\'re going to have to work on boring stuff.  Easy,compared to college, but boring.  At first it may seem cool to getpaid for doing easy stuff, after paying to do hard stuff in college.But that wears off after a few months.  Eventually it gets demoralizingto work on dumb stuff, even if it\\'s easy and you get paid a lot.And that\\'s not the worst of it.  The thing that really sucks abouthaving a regular job is the expectation that you\\'re supposed to bethere at certain times.  Even Google is afflicted with this,apparently.  And what this means, as everyone who\\'s had a regularjob can tell you, is that there are going to be times when you haveabsolutely no desire to work on anything, and you\\'re going to haveto go to work anyway and sit in front of your screen and pretendto.  To someone who likes work, as most good hackers do, this istorture.In a startup, you skip all that.  There\\'s no concept of office hoursin most startups.  Work and life just get mixed together.  But thegood thing about that is that no one minds if you have a life atwork.  In a startup you can do whatever you want most of the time.If you\\'re a founder, what you want to do most of the time is work.But you never have to pretend to.If you took a nap in your office in a big company, it would seemunprofessional.  But if you\\'re starting a startup and you fallasleep in the middle of the day, your cofounders will just assumeyou were tired.15. Parents want you to be a doctorA significant number of would-be startup founders are probablydissuaded from doing it by their parents.  I\\'m not going to say youshouldn\\'t listen to them.  Families are entitled to their owntraditions, and who am I to argue with them?  But I will give youa couple reasons why a safe career might not be what your parentsreally want for you.One is that parents tend to be more conservative for their kidsthan they would be for themselves.  This is actually a rationalresponse to their situation.  Parents end up sharing more of theirkids\\' ill fortune than good fortune.  Most parents don\\'t mind this;it\\'s part of the job; but it does tend to make them excessivelyconservative.  And erring on the side of conservatism is stillerring.  In almost everything, reward is proportionate to risk.  Soby protecting their kids from risk, parents are, without realizingit, also protecting them from rewards.  If they saw that, they\\'dwant you to take more risks.The other reason parents may be mistaken is that, like generals,they\\'re always fighting the last war.  If they want you to be adoctor, odds are it\\'s not just because they want you to help thesick, but also because it\\'s a prestigious and lucrative career.But not so lucrative or prestigious as it was when theiropinions were formed.  When I was a kid in the seventies, a doctorwasthething to be.  There was a sort of golden triangle involvingdoctors, Mercedes 450SLs, and tennis.  All three vertices now seempretty dated.The parents who want you to be a doctor may simply not realize howmuch things have changed.  Would they be that unhappy if you wereSteve Jobs instead?  So I think the way to deal with your parents\\'opinions about what you should do is to treat them like featurerequests.  Even if your only goal is to please them, the way to dothat is not simply to give them what they ask for.  Instead thinkabout why they\\'re asking for something, and see if there\\'s a betterway to give them what they need.16.  A job is the defaultThis leads us to the last and probably most powerful reason peopleget regular jobs: it\\'s the default thing to do.  Defaults areenormously powerful, precisely because they operate without anyconscious choice.To almost everyone except criminals, it seems an axiom that if youneed money, you should get a job.  Actually this tradition is notmuch more than a hundred years old.  Before that, the default wayto make a living was by farming.  It\\'s a bad plan to treat somethingonly a hundred years old as an axiom.  By historical standards,that\\'s something that\\'s changing pretty rapidly.We may be seeing another such change right now.  I\\'ve read a lotof economic history, and I understand the startup world pretty well,and it now seems to me fairly likely that we\\'re seeing the beginningof a change like the one from farming to manufacturing.And you know what?  If you\\'d been around when that change began(around 1000 in Europe) it would have seemed to nearly everyonethat running off to the city to make your fortune was a crazy thingto do.  Though serfs were in principle forbidden to leave theirmanors, it can\\'t have been that hard to run away to a city.  Therewere no guards patrolling the perimeter of the village.  Whatprevented most serfs from leaving was that it seemed insanely risky.Leave one\\'s plot of land?  Leave the people you\\'d spent your wholelife with, to live in a giant city of three or four thousand completestrangers?  How would you live?  How would you get food, if youdidn\\'t grow it?Frightening as it seemed to them, it\\'s now the default with us tolive by our wits.  So if it seems risky to you to start a startup,think how risky it once seemed to your ancestors to live as we donow.  Oddly enough, the people who know this best are the very onestrying to get you to stick to the old model.  How can Larry andSergey say you should come work as their employee, when they didn\\'tget jobs themselves?Now we look back on medieval peasants and wonder how they stood it.How grim it must have been to till the same fields your whole lifewith no hope of anything better, under the thumb of lords and priestsyou had to give all your surplus to and acknowledge as your masters.I wouldn\\'t be surprised if one day people look back on what weconsider a normal job in the same way.  How grim it would be tocommute every day to a cubicle in some soulless office complex, andbe told what to do by someone you had to acknowledge as a boss—someone who could call you into their office and say \"take a seat,\"and you\\'d sit!  Imagine having to askpermissionto releasesoftware to users.  Imagine being sad on Sunday afternoons becausethe weekend was almost over, and tomorrow you\\'d have to get up andgo to work.  How did they stand it?It\\'s exciting to think we may be on the cusp of another shift likethe one from farming to manufacturing.  That\\'s why I care aboutstartups.  Startups aren\\'t interesting just because they\\'re a wayto make a lot of money.  I couldn\\'t care less about other ways todo that, like speculating in securities.  At most those are interestingthe way puzzles are.  There\\'s more going on with startups.  Theymay represent one of those rare, historic shifts in the waywealthis created.That\\'s ultimately what drives us to work on Y Combinator.  We wantto make money, if only so we don\\'t have to stop doing it, but that\\'snot the main goal.  There have only been a handful of these greateconomic shifts in human history.  It would be an amazing hack tomake one happen faster.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': '(This essay is derived from a talk at Google.)A few weeks ago I found to my surprise that I\\'d been granted fourpatents.  This was all the more surprisingbecause I\\'d only applied for three.  The patents aren\\'t mine, ofcourse.  They were assigned to Viaweb, and became Yahoo\\'s when theybought us.  But the news set me thinking about the question ofsoftware patents generally.Patents are a hard problem.  I\\'ve had to advise most of the startupswe\\'ve funded about them, and despite years of experience I\\'m stillnot always sure I\\'m giving the right advice.One thing I do feel pretty certain of is that if you\\'re againstsoftware patents, you\\'re against patents in general.  Gradually ourmachines consist more and more of software.  Things that used tobe done with levers and cams and gears are now done with loops andtrees and closures.  There\\'s nothing special about physical embodimentsof control systems that should make them patentable, and the softwareequivalent not.Unfortunately, patent law is inconsistent on this point.  Patentlaw in most countries says that algorithms aren\\'t patentable.  Thisrule is left over from a time when \"algorithm\" meant something likethe Sieve of Eratosthenes.  In 1800, people could not see as readilyas we can that a great many patents on mechanical objects werereally patents on the algorithms they embodied.Patent lawyers still have to pretend that\\'s what they\\'re doing whenthey patent algorithms.  You must not use the word \"algorithm\" inthe title of a patent application, just as you must not use theword \"essays\" in the title of a book.  If you want to patent analgorithm, you have to frame it as a computer system executing that algorithm.Then it\\'s mechanical; phew.  The default euphemism for algorithmis \"system and method.\"  Try a patent search for that phrase andsee how many results you get.Since software patents are no different from hardware patents,people who say \"software patents are evil\" are saying simply \"patentsare evil.\"  So why do so many people complain about software patentsspecifically?I think the problem is more with the patent office than the conceptof software patents.  Whenever software meets government, bad thingshappen, because software changes fast and government changes slow.The patent office has been overwhelmed by both the volume and thenovelty of applications for software patents, and as a result they\\'vemade a lot of mistakes.The most common is to grant patents that shouldn\\'t be granted.  Tobe patentable, an invention has to be more than new.  It also hasto be non-obvious.  And this, especially, is where the USPTO hasbeen dropping the ball. Slashdot has an icon that expresses theproblem vividly: a knife and fork with the words \"patent pending\"superimposed.The scary thing is, this is theonlyicon they have forpatent stories.  Slashdot readers now take it for granted that astory about a patent will be about a bogus patent.That\\'s how bad the problem has become.The problem with Amazon\\'s notorious one-click patent, for example,is not that it\\'s a software patent, but that it\\'s obvious.  Anyonline store that kept people\\'s shipping addresses would haveimplemented this.  The reason Amazon did it first was not that theywere especially smart, but because they were one of the earliestsites with enough clout to force customers to log in before theycould buy something.We, as hackers, know the USPTO is letting people patent the knivesand forks of our world.  The problem is, the USPTO are not hackers.They\\'re probably good at judging new inventions for casting steelor grinding lenses, but they don\\'t understand software yet.At this point an optimist would be tempted to add \"but they willeventually.\"  Unfortunately that might not be true.  The problemwith software patents is an instance of a more general one: thepatent office takes a while to understand new technology.  If so,this problem will only get worse, because the rate of technologicalchange seems to be increasing.  In thirty years, the patent officemay understand the sort of things we now patent as software, butthere will be other new types of inventions they understand evenless.Applying for a patent is a negotiation.  You generally apply for abroader patent than you think you\\'ll be granted, and the examinersreply by throwing out some of your claims and granting others.  SoI don\\'t really blame Amazon for applying for the one-click patent.The big mistake was the patent office\\'s, for not insisting onsomething narrower, with real technical content.  By granting suchan over-broad patent, the USPTO in effect slept with Amazon on thefirst date.  Was Amazon supposed to say no?Where Amazon went over to the dark side was not in applying for thepatent, but in enforcing it.  A lot of companies (Microsoft, forexample) have been granted large numbers of preposterously over-broadpatents,  but they keep them mainly for defensive purposes.  Likenuclear weapons, the main role of big companies\\' patent portfoliosis to threaten anyone who attacks them with a counter-suit.  Amazon\\'ssuit against Barnes & Noble was thus the equivalent of a nuclearfirst strike.That suit probably hurt Amazon more than it helped them.  Barnes &Noble was a lame site; Amazon would have crushed them anyway.  Toattack a rival they could have ignored, Amazon put a lasting blackmark on their own reputation.  Even now I think if you asked hackersto free-associate about Amazon, the one-click patent would turn upin the first ten topics.Google clearly doesn\\'t feel that merely holding patents is evil.They\\'ve applied for a lot of them.  Are they hypocrites?  Are patentsevil?There are really two variants of that question, and people answeringit often aren\\'t clear in their own minds which they\\'re answering.There\\'s a narrow variant: is it bad, given the current legal system,to apply for patents? and also a broader one: is it bad that thecurrent legal system allows patents?These are separate questions.  For example, in preindustrial societieslike medieval Europe, when someone attacked you, you didn\\'t callthe police.  There were no police.  When attacked, you were supposedto fight back, and there were conventions about how to do it.  Wasthis wrong?  That\\'s two questions: was it wrong to take justiceinto your own hands, and was it wrong that you had to?  We tend tosay yes to the second, but no to the first.  If no one else willdefend you, you have to defend yourself.The situation with patents is similar.  Business is a kind ofritualized warfare.  Indeed, it evolved from actual warfare: mostearly traders switched on the fly from merchants to pirates dependingon how strong you seemed.  In business there are certain rulesdescribing how companies may and may not compete with one another,and someone deciding that they\\'re going to play by their own rulesis missing the point.  Saying \"I\\'m not going to apply for patentsjust because everyone else does\" is not like saying \"I\\'m not goingto lie just because everyone else does.\"  It\\'s more like saying\"I\\'m not going to use TCP/IP just because everyone else does.\" Ohyes you are.A closer comparison might be someone seeing a hockey game for thefirst time, realizing with shock that the players weredeliberatelybumping into one another, and deciding that one would on no accountbe so rude when playing hockey oneself.Hockey allows checking.  It\\'s part of the game.  If your team refusesto do it, you simply lose.  So it is in business.  Under the presentrules, patents are part of the game.What does that mean in practice?  We tell the startups we fund notto worry about infringing patents, because startups rarely get suedfor patent infringement.  There are only two reasons someone mightsue you: for money, or to prevent you from competing with them.Startups are too poor to be worth suing for money. And in practicethey don\\'t seem to get sued much by competitors, either.  They don\\'tget sued by other startups because (a) patent suits are an expensivedistraction, and (b) since the other startups are as young as theyare, their patents probably haven\\'t issued yet.Nor do startups,at least in the software business, seem to get sued much by establishedcompetitors.  Despite all the patents Microsoft holds, I don\\'t knowof an instance where they sued a startup for patent infringement.Companies like Microsoft and Oracle don\\'t win by winning lawsuits.That\\'s too uncertain.  They win by locking competitors out of theirsales channels.  If you do manage to threaten them, they\\'re morelikely to buy you than sue you.When you read of big companies filing patent suits against smallerones, it\\'s usually a big company on the way down, grasping atstraws.  For example, Unisys\\'s attempts to enforce their patent onLZW compression.  When you see a big company threatening patentsuits, sell.  When a company starts fighting over IP, it\\'s a signthey\\'ve lost the real battle, for users.A company that sues competitors for patent infringement is likea defender who has been beaten so thoroughly that he turns to pleadwith the referee.  You don\\'t do that if you can still reach theball, even if you genuinely believe you\\'ve been fouled.  So a companythreatening patent suits is a company introuble.When we were working on Viaweb, a bigger company in the e-commercebusiness was granted a patent on online ordering, or something likethat.  I got a call from a VP there asking if we\\'d like to licenseit.  I replied that I thought the patent was completely bogus, andwould never hold up in court.  \"Ok,\" he replied.  \"So, are you guyshiring?\"If your startup grows big enough, however, you\\'ll start to get sued,no matter what you do.  If you go public, for example, you\\'ll besued by multiple patent trolls who hope you\\'ll pay them off to goaway.  More on them later.In other words, no one will sue you for patent infringement tillyou have money, and once you have money, people will sue you whetherthey have grounds to or not.  So I advise fatalism.  Don\\'t wasteyour time worrying about patent infringement.  You\\'re probablyviolating a patent every time you tie your shoelaces.  At the start,at least, just worry about making something great and getting lotsof users.  If you grow to the point where anyone considers you worthattacking, you\\'re doing well.We do advise the companies we fund to apply for patents, but notso they can sue competitors.  Successful startups either get boughtor grow into big companies.  If a startup wants to grow into a bigcompany, they should apply for patents to build up the patentportfolio they\\'ll need to maintain an armed truce with other bigcompanies.  If they want to get bought, they should apply for patentsbecause patents are part of the mating dance with acquirers.Most startups that succeed do it by getting bought, and most acquirerscare about patents.  Startup acquisitions are usually a build-vs-buydecision for the acquirer.  Should we buy this little startup orbuild our own?  And two things, especially, make them decide notto build their own: if you already have a large and rapidly growinguser base, and if you have a fairly solid patent application oncritical parts of your software.There\\'s a third reason big companies should prefer buying to building:that if they built their own, they\\'d screw it up.  But few bigcompanies are smart enough yet to admit this to themselves.  It\\'susually the acquirer\\'s engineers who are asked how hard it wouldbe for the company to build their own, and they overestimate theirabilities.A patent seems to change the balance.  It gives theacquirer an excuse to admit they couldn\\'t copy what you\\'re doing.It may also help them to grasp what\\'s special about your technology.Frankly, it surprises me how small a role patents play in thesoftware business.  It\\'s kind of ironic, considering all the direthings experts say about software patents stifling innovation, butwhen one looks closely at the software business, the most strikingthing is how little patents seem to matter.In other fields, companies regularly sue competitors for patentinfringement.  For example, the airport baggage scanning businesswas for many years a cozy duopoly shared between two companies,InVision and L-3.  In 2002 a startup called Reveal appeared, withnew technology that let them build scanners a third the size.  Theywere sued for patent infringement before they\\'d even released aproduct.You rarely hear that kind of story in our world.  The one exampleI\\'ve found is, embarrassingly enough, Yahoo, which filed a patentsuit against a gaming startup called Xfire in 2005.  Xfire doesn\\'tseem to be a very big deal, and it\\'s hard to say why Yahoo feltthreatened.  Xfire\\'s VP of engineering had worked at Yahoo on similarstuff-- in fact, he was listed as an inventor on the patent Yahoosued over-- so perhaps there was something personal about it.  Myguess is that someone at Yahoo goofed.  At any rate they didn\\'tpursue the suit very vigorously.Why do patents play so small a role in software?  I can think ofthree possible reasons.One is that software is so complicated that patents by themselvesare not worth very much.  I may be maligning other fields here, butit seems that in most types of engineering you can hand the detailsof some new technique to a group of medium-high quality people andget the desired result.  For example, if someone develops a newprocess for smelting ore that gets a better yield, and you assemblea team of qualified experts and tell them about it, they\\'ll be ableto get the same yield.  This doesn\\'t seem to work in software.Software is so subtle and unpredictable that \"qualified experts\"don\\'t get you very far.That\\'s why we rarely hear phrases like \"qualified expert\" in thesoftware business.  What that level of ability can get you is, say,to make your software compatible with some other piece of software--in eight months, at enormous cost.  To do anything harder you needindividual brilliance.  If you assemble a team of qualified expertsand tell them to make a new web-based email program, they\\'ll gettheir asses kicked by a team of inspired nineteen year olds.Experts can implement, but they can\\'tdesign.Or rather, expertise in implementation is the only kind most people,including the experts themselves, can measure.But design is a definite skill.  It\\'s not just an airy intangible.Things always seem intangible when you don\\'t understand them.Electricity seemed an airy intangible to most people in 1800.  Whoknew there was so much to know about it?  So it is with design.Some people are good at it and some people are bad at it, and there\\'ssomething very tangible they\\'re good or bad at.The reason design counts so much in software is probably that thereare fewer constraints than on physical things.  Building physicalthings is expensive and dangerous.  The space of possible choicesis smaller; you tend to have to work as part of a larger group; andyou\\'re subject to a lot of regulations.  You don\\'t have any of thatif you and a couple friends decide to create a new web-basedapplication.Because there\\'s so much scope for design in software, a successfulapplication tends to be way more than the sum of its patents.  Whatprotects little companies from being copied by bigger competitorsis not just their patents, but the thousand little things the bigcompany will get wrong if they try.The second reason patents don\\'t count for much in our world is thatstartups rarely attack big companies head-on, the way Reveal did.In the software business, startups beat established companies bytranscending them.  Startups don\\'t build desktop word processingprograms to compete with Microsoft Word.They build Writely.If this paradigm is crowded, just wait for the next one; they runpretty frequently on this route.Fortunately for startups, big companies are extremely good at denial.If you take the trouble to attack them from an oblique angle, they\\'llmeet you half-way and maneuver to keep you in their blind spot.  Tosue a startup would mean admitting it was dangerous, and that oftenmeans seeing something the big company doesn\\'t want to see.  IBMused to sue its mainframe competitors regularly, but they didn\\'tbother much about the microcomputer industry because they didn\\'twant to see the threat it posed.  Companies building web based appsare similarly protected from Microsoft, which even now doesn\\'t wantto imagine a world in which Windows is irrelevant.The third reason patents don\\'t seem to matter very much in softwareis public opinion-- or rather, hacker opinion.  In a recentinterview,Steve Ballmer coyly left open the possibility of attacking Linuxon patent grounds.  But I doubt Microsoft would ever be so stupid.They\\'d face the mother of all boycotts.  And not just from thetechnical community in general; a lot of their own people wouldrebel.Good hackers care a lot about matters of principle, and they arehighly mobile.  If a company starts misbehaving, smart people won\\'twork there.  For some reason this seems to be more true in softwarethan other businesses.  I don\\'t think it\\'s because hackers haveintrinsically higher principles so much as that their skills areeasily transferrable.  Perhaps we can split the difference and saythat mobility gives hackers the luxury of being principled.Google\\'s \"don\\'t be evil\" policy may for this reason be the mostvaluable thing they\\'ve discovered.  It\\'s very constraining in someways.  If Google does do something evil, they get doubly whackedfor it: once for whatever they did, and again for hypocrisy.  ButI think it\\'s worth it.  It helps them to hire the best people, andit\\'s better, even from a purely selfish point of view, to beconstrained by principles than by stupidity.(I wish someone would get this point across to the presentadministration.)I\\'m not sure what the proportions are of the preceding threeingredients, but the custom among the big companies seems to be notto sue the small ones, and the startups are mostly too busy and toopoor to sue one another.  So despite the huge number of softwarepatents there\\'s not a lot of suing going on.  With one exception:patent trolls.Patent trolls are companies consisting mainly of lawyers whose wholebusiness is to accumulate patents and threaten to sue companies whoactually make things.  Patent trolls, it seems safe to say, areevil.  I feel a bit stupid saying that, because when you\\'re sayingsomething that Richard Stallman and Bill Gates would both agreewith, you must be perilously close to tautologies.The CEO of Forgent, one of the most notorious patent trolls, saysthat what his company does is \"the American way.\" Actually that\\'snot true. The American way is to make money bycreating wealth, not by suing people.What companies like Forgent do is actually the proto-industrialway.  In the period just before the industrial revolution, some ofthe greatest fortunes in countries like England and France weremade by courtiers who extracted some lucrative right from the crown--like the right to collect taxes on the import of silk-- and thenused this to squeeze money from the merchants in that business.  Sowhen people compare patent trolls to the mafia, they\\'re more rightthan they know, because the mafia too are not merely bad, but badspecifically in the sense of being an obsolete business model.Patent trolls seem to have caught big companies by surprise.  Inthe last couple years they\\'ve extracted hundreds of millions ofdollars from them.  Patent trolls are hard to fight precisely becausethey create nothing.  Big companies are safe from being sued byother big companies because they can threaten a counter-suit.  Butbecause patent trolls don\\'t make anything, there\\'s nothing they canbe sued for.  I predict this loophole will get closed fairly quickly,at least by legal standards.  It\\'s clearly an abuse of the system,and the victims are powerful.But evil as patent trolls are, I don\\'t think they hamper innovationmuch.  They don\\'t sue till a startup has made money, and by thatpoint the innovation that generated it has already happened.  Ican\\'t think of a startup that avoided working on some problem becauseof patent trolls.So much for hockey as the game is played now.  What about the moretheoretical question of whether hockey would be a better game withoutchecking?  Do patents encourage or discourage innovation?This is a very hard question to answer in the general case.  Peoplewrite whole books on the topic.  One of my main hobbies is thehistory of technology, and even though I\\'ve studied the subject foryears, it would take me several weeks of research to be able to saywhether patents have in general been a net win.One thing I can say is that 99.9% of the people who express opinionson the subject do it not based on such research, but out of a kindof religious conviction.  At least, that\\'s the polite way of puttingit; the colloquial version involves speech coming out of organs notdesigned for that purpose.Whether they encourage innovation or not, patents were at leastintended to.  You don\\'t get a patent for nothing.  In return forthe exclusive right to use an idea, you have topublishit,and it was largely to encourage such openness that patents wereestablished.Before patents, people protected ideas by keeping them secret.  Withpatents, central governments said, in effect, if you tell everyoneyour idea, we\\'ll protect it for you.  There is a parallel here tothe rise of civil order, which happened at roughly the same time.Before central governments were powerful enough to enforce order,rich people had private armies.  As governments got more powerful,they gradually compelled magnates to cede most responsibility forprotecting them.  (Magnates still have bodyguards, but no longerto protect them from other magnates.)Patents, like police, are involved in many abuses.  But in bothcases the default is something worse. The choice is not \"patentsor freedom?\" any more than it is \"police or freedom?\" The actualquestions are respectively \"patents or secrecy?\" and \"police organgs?\"As with gangs, we have some idea what secrecy would be like, becausethat\\'s how things used to be.  The economy of medieval Europe wasdivided up into little tribes, each jealously guarding theirprivileges and secrets.  In Shakespeare\\'s time, \"mystery\" wassynonymous with \"craft.\"   Even today we can see an echo of thesecrecy of medieval guilds, in the now pointless secrecy of theMasons.The most memorable example of medieval industrial secrecy is probablyVenice, which forbade glassblowers to leave the city, and sentassassins after those who tried.  We might like to think we wouldn\\'tgo so far, but the movie industry has already tried to passlawsprescribing three year prison terms just for putting movies onpublic networks.  Want to try a frightening thought experiment? Ifthe movie industry could have any law they wanted, where would theystop?  Short of the death penalty, one assumes, but how close wouldthey get?Even worse than the spectacular abuses might be the overall decreasein efficiency that would accompany increased secrecy.  As anyonewho has dealt with organizations that operate on a \"need to know\"basis can attest, dividing information up into little cells isterribly inefficient.  The flaw in the \"need to know\" principle isthat you don\\'tknowwho needs to know something.  An ideafrom one area might spark a great discovery in another.  But thediscoverer doesn\\'t know he needs to know it.If secrecy were the only protection for ideas, companies wouldn\\'tjust have to be secretive with other companies; they\\'d have to besecretive internally.  This would encourage what is already theworst trait of big companies.I\\'m not saying secrecy would be worse than patents, just that wecouldn\\'t discard patents for free.  Businesses would become moresecretive to compensate, and in some fields this might get ugly.Nor am I defending the current patent system.  There is clearly alot that\\'s broken about it.   But the breakage seems to affectsoftware less than most other fields.In the software business I know from experience whether patentsencourage or discourage innovation, and the answer is the type thatpeople who like to argue about public policy least like to hear:they don\\'t affect innovation much, one way or the other.  Mostinnovation in the software business happens in startups, and startupsshould simply ignore other companies\\' patents.  At least, that\\'swhat we advise, and we bet money on that advice.The only real role of patents, for most startups, is as an elementof the mating dance with acquirers.  There patents do help a little.And so they do encourage innovation indirectly, in that they givemore power to startups, which is where, pound for pound, the mostinnovation happens.  But even in the mating dance, patents are ofsecondary importance.  It matters more to make something great andget a lot of users.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': '(This article explains why much of the next generation of softwaremay be server-based, what that will mean for programmers,and why this new kind of software is a great opportunity for startups.It\\'s derived from a talk at BBN Labs.)In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I decided tostart a startup.  The PR campaign leading up to Netscape\\'s IPO wasrunning full blast then, and there was a lot of talk in the pressabout online commerce.  At the time there might have been thirtyactual stores on the Web, all made by hand.  If there were goingto be a lot of online stores, there would need to be software for makingthem, so we decided to write some.For the first week or so we intended to make this an ordinary   desktop application.  Then one day we had the idea of making thesoftware run on our Web server, using the browser as aninterface.  We tried rewriting the software to work overthe Web, and it was clear that this was the way to go.If we wrote our software to run on the server, it would be a lot easierfor the users and for us as well.This turned out to be a good plan.  Now, asYahoo Store, thissoftware is the most popular online store builder, withabout 14,000 users.When we started Viaweb, hardly anyone understood what we meant whenwe said that the software ran on the server.  It was not untilHotmail was launched a year later that people started to get it.Now everyone knows that this is a valid approach.  There isa name now for what we were: an Application Service Provider,or ASP.I think that a lot of the next generation of software will bewritten on this model.  Even Microsoft, who have the most tolose, seem to see the inevitablity of moving some things offthe desktop. If software movesoff the desktop and onto servers, it will mean a very differentworld for developers.  This article describes the surprisingthings we saw, as some of the first visitors to this new world.To the extent software does move ontoservers, what I\\'m describing here is the future.The Next Thing?When we look back on the desktop software era, I think we\\'ll marvelat the inconveniences people put up with, just as we marvel now atwhat early car owners put up with.  For the first twenty or thirtyyears, you had to be a car expert to own a car.  But cars were sucha big win that lots of people who weren\\'t car experts wanted tohave them as well.Computers are in this phase now.  When you own a desktop computer,you end up learning a lot more than you wanted to know about what\\'shappening inside it.  But more than half the households in the USown one.  My mother has a computer that she uses for email and forkeeping accounts.  About a year ago she was alarmed to receive aletter from Apple, offering her a discount on a new version of theoperating system.  There\\'s something wrong when a sixty-five yearold woman who wants to use a computer for email and accounts hasto think about installing new operating systems.  Ordinary usersshouldn\\'t even know the words \"operating system,\" much less \"devicedriver\" or \"patch.\"There is now another way to deliver software that will save usersfrom becoming system administrators.  Web-based applications areprograms that run on Web servers and use Web pages as the userinterface.  For the average user this new kind of software will beeasier, cheaper, more mobile, more reliable, and often more powerfulthan desktop software.With Web-based software, most users won\\'t have to think aboutanything except the applications they use.  All the messy, changingstuff will be sitting on a server somewhere, maintained by the kindof people who are good at that kind of thing.  And so you won\\'tordinarily need a computer, per se, to use software.  All you\\'llneed will be something with a keyboard, a screen, and a Web browser.Maybe it will have wireless Internet access.  Maybe it will alsobe your cell phone.  Whatever it is, it will be consumer electronics:something that costs about $200, and that people choose mostlybased on how the case looks.  You\\'ll pay more for Internet servicesthan you do for the hardware, just as you do now with telephones. [1]It will take about a tenth of a second for a click to get to theserver and back, so users of heavily interactive software, likePhotoshop, will still want to have the computations happening onthe desktop.  But if you look at the kind of things most peopleuse computers for, a tenth of a second latency would not be aproblem.  My mother doesn\\'t really need a desktop computer, andthere are a lot of people like her.The Win for UsersNear my house there is a car with a bumper sticker that reads \"deathbefore inconvenience.\"  Most people, most of the time, will takewhatever choice requires least work.  If Web-based software wins,it will be because it\\'s more convenient.  And it looks as if itwill be, for users and developers both.To use a purely Web-based application, all you need is a browserconnected to the Internet.  So you can use a Web-based applicationanywhere.  When you install software on your desktop computer, youcan only use it on that computer.  Worse still, your files aretrapped on that computer.  The inconvenience of this model becomesmore and more evident as people get used to networks.The thin end of the wedge here was Web-based email.  Millions ofpeople now realize that you should have access to email messagesno matter where you are.  And if you can see your email, why notyour calendar?  If you can discuss a document with your colleagues,why can\\'t you edit it?  Why should any of your data be trapped onsome computer sitting on a faraway desk?The whole idea of \"your computer\" is going away, and being replacedwith \"your data.\"  You should be able to get at your data from anycomputer.  Or rather, any client, and a client doesn\\'t have to bea computer.Clients shouldn\\'t store data; they should be like telephones.  Infact they may become telephones, or vice versa.  And as clientsget smaller, you have another reason not to keep your data on them:something you carry around with you can be lost or stolen.   Leavingyour PDA in a taxi is like a disk crash, except that your data ishanded tosomeone elseinstead of being vaporized.With purely Web-based software, neither your data nor the applicationsare kept on the client.  So you don\\'t have to install anything touse it.  And when there\\'s no installation, you don\\'t have to worryabout installation going wrong.  There can\\'t be incompatibilitiesbetween the application and your operating system, because thesoftware doesn\\'t run on your operating system.Because it needs no installation, it will be easy, and common, totry Web-based software before you \"buy\" it.  You should expect tobe able to test-drive any Web-based application for free, just bygoing to the site where it\\'s offered.  At Viaweb our whole sitewas like a big arrow pointing users to the test drive.After trying the demo, signing up for the service should requirenothing more than filling out a brief form (the briefer the better).And that should be the last work the user has to do.  With Web-basedsoftware, you should get new releases without paying extra, ordoing any work, or possibly even knowing about it.Upgrades won\\'t be the big shocks they are now.  Over time applicationswill quietly grow more powerful.  This will take some effort onthe part of the developers.  They will have to design software sothat it can be updated without confusing the users.  That\\'s a newproblem, but there are ways to solve it.With Web-based applications, everyone uses the same version, andbugs can be fixed as soon as they\\'re discovered.  So Web-basedsoftware should have far fewer bugs than desktop software.  AtViaweb, I doubt we ever had ten known bugs at any one time.  That\\'sorders of magnitude better than desktop software.Web-based applications can be used by several people at the sametime.  This is an obvious win for collaborative applications, butI bet users will start to want this in most applications once theyrealize it\\'s possible.  It will often be useful to let two peopleedit the same document, for example.  Viaweb let multiple usersedit a site simultaneously, more because that was the right way towrite the software than because we expected users to want to, butit turned out that many did.When you use a Web-based application, your data will be safer.Disk crashes won\\'t be a thing of the past, but users won\\'t hearabout them anymore.  They\\'ll happen within server farms.  Andcompanies offering Web-based applications will actually do backups--not only because they\\'ll have real system administrators worryingabout such things, but because an ASP that does lose people\\'s datawill be in big, big trouble.  When people lose their own data ina disk crash, they can\\'t get that mad, because they only havethemselves to be mad at.  When a company loses their data for them,they\\'ll get a lot madder.Finally, Web-based software should be less vulnerable to viruses.If the client doesn\\'t run anything except a browser, there\\'s lesschance of running viruses, and no data locally to damage.  And aprogram that attacked the servers themselves should find them verywell defended. [2]For users, Web-based software will beless stressful.I think ifyou looked inside the average Windows user you\\'d find a huge andpretty much untapped desire for software meeting that description.Unleashed, it could be a powerful force.City of CodeTo developers, the most conspicuous difference between Web-basedand desktop software is that a Web-based application is not a singlepiece of code.  It will be a collection of programs of differenttypes rather than a single big binary.  And so designing Web-basedsoftware is like desiging a city rather than a building: as wellas buildings you need roads, street signs, utilities, police andfire departments, and plans for both growth and various kinds ofdisasters.At Viaweb, software included fairly big applications that userstalked to directly, programs that those programs used, programsthat ran constantly in the background looking for problems, programsthat tried to restart things if they broke, programs that ranoccasionally to compile statistics or build indexes for searches,programs we ran explicitly to garbage-collect resources or to moveor restore data, programs that pretended to be users (to measureperformance or expose bugs), programs for diagnosing networktroubles, programs for doing backups, interfaces to outside services,software that drove an impressive collection of dials displayingreal-time server statistics (a hit with visitors, but indispensablefor us too), modifications (including bug fixes) to open-sourcesoftware, and a great many configuration files and settings.  TrevorBlackwell wrote a spectacular program for moving stores to newservers across the country, without shutting them down, after wewere bought by Yahoo. Programs paged us, sent faxes and email tousers, conducted transactions with credit card processors, andtalked to one another through sockets, pipes, http requests, ssh,udp packets, shared memory, and files.  Some of Viaweb even consistedof the absence of programs, since one of the keys to Unix securityis not to run unnecessary utilities that people might use to breakinto your servers.It did not end with software.  We spent a lot of time thinkingabout server configurations.  We built the servers ourselves, fromcomponents-- partly to save money, and partly to get exactly whatwe wanted.  We had to think about whether our upstream ISP had fastenough connections to all the backbones.  We seriallydatedRAID suppliers.But hardware is not just something to worry about.  When you controlit you can do more for users.  With a desktop application, you canspecify certain minimum hardware, but you can\\'t add more.  If youadminister the servers, you can in one step enable all your usersto page people, or send faxes, or send commands by phone, or processcredit cards, etc, just by installing the relevant hardware.  Wealways looked for new ways to add features with hardware, not justbecause it pleased users, but also as a way to distinguish ourselvesfrom competitors who (either because they sold desktop software,or resold Web-based applications through ISPs) didn\\'t have directcontrol over the hardware.Because the software in a Web-based application will be a collectionof programs rather than a single binary, it can be written in anynumber of different languages.  When you\\'re writing desktop software,you\\'re practically forced to write the application in the samelanguage as the underlying operating system-- meaning C and C++.And so these languages (especially among nontechnical people likemanagers and VCs) got to be considered as the languages for \"serious\"software development.  But that was just an artifact of the waydesktop software had to be delivered.  For server-based softwareyou can use any language you want. [3]  Today a lot of the tophackers are using languages far removed from C and C++:  Perl,Python, and even Lisp.With server-based software, no one can tell you what language touse, because you control the whole system, right down to thehardware.  Different languages are good for different tasks.  Youcan use whichever is best for each.  And when you have competitors,\"you can\" means \"you must\" (we\\'ll return to this later), becauseif you don\\'t take advantage of this possibility, your competitorswill.Most of our competitors used C and C++, and this made their softwarevisibly inferior because (among other things), they had no wayaround the statelessness of CGI scripts.  If you were going tochange something, all the changes had to happen on one page, withan Update button at the bottom.  As I\\'ve written elsewhere, byusingLisp, which many people still consider a research language,we could make the Viaweb editor behave more like desktop software.ReleasesOne of the most important changes in this new world is the way youdo releases. In the desktop software business, doing a release isa huge trauma, in which the whole company sweats and strains topush out a single, giant piece of code.  Obvious comparisons suggestthemselves, both to the process and the resulting product.With server-based software, you can make changes almost as youwould in a program you were writing for yourself.  You releasesoftware as a series of incremental changes instead of an occasionalbig explosion. A typical desktop software company might do one ortwo releases a year.  At Viaweb we often did three to five releasesa day.When you switch to this new model, you realize how much softwaredevelopment is affected by the way it is released.  Many of thenastiest problems you see in the desktop software business are dueto catastrophic nature of releases.When you release only one new version a year, you tend to deal withbugs wholesale.  Some time before the release date you assemble anew version in which half the code has been torn out and replaced,introducing countless bugs.  Then a squad of QA people step in andstart counting them, and the programmers work down the list, fixingthem.  They do not generally get to the end of the list, and indeed,no one is sure where the end is.  It\\'s like fishing rubble out ofa pond.  You never really know what\\'s happening inside the software.At best you end up with a statistical sort of correctness.With server-based software, most of the change is small andincremental.  That in itself is less likely to introduce bugs.  Italso means you know what to test most carefully when you\\'re aboutto release software: the last thing you changed.  You end up witha much firmer grip on the code.  As a general rule, you do knowwhat\\'s happening inside it.  You don\\'t have the source code memorized,of course, but when you read the source you do it like a pilotscanning the instrument panel, not like a detective trying tounravel some mystery.Desktop software breeds a certain fatalism about bugs.  You knowthat you\\'re shipping something loaded with bugs, and you\\'ve evenset up mechanisms to compensate for it (e.g. patch releases).  Sowhy worry about a few more?  Soon you\\'re releasing whole featuresyou know are broken.Appledid this earlier this year.  They feltunder pressure to release their new OS, whose release date hadalready slipped four times, but some of the software (support forCDs and DVDs) wasn\\'t ready. The solution?  They released the OSwithout the unfinished parts, and users will have to install themlater.With Web-based software, you never have to release software beforeit works, and you can release it as soon as it does work.The industry veteran may be thinking, it\\'s a fine-sounding idea tosay that you never have to release software before it works, butwhat happens when you\\'ve promised to deliver a new version of yoursoftware by a certain date?  With Web-based software, you wouldn\\'tmake such a promise, because there are no versions.  Your softwarechanges gradually and continuously.  Some changes might be biggerthan others, but the idea of versions just doesn\\'t naturally fitonto Web-based software.If anyone remembers Viaweb this might sound odd, because we werealways announcing new versions.  This was done entirely for PRpurposes.  The trade press, we learned, thinks in version numbers.They will give you major coverage for a major release, meaning anew first digit on the version number, and generally a paragraphat most for a point release, meaning a new digit after the decimalpoint.Some of our competitors were offering desktop software and actuallyhad version numbers.  And for these releases, the mere fact ofwhich seemed to us evidence of their backwardness, they would getall kinds of publicity.  We didn\\'t want to miss out, so we startedgiving version numbers to our software too.  When we wanted somepublicity, we\\'d make a list of all the features we\\'d added sincethe last \"release,\" stick a new version number on the software,and issue a press release saying that the new version was availableimmediately.  Amazingly, no one ever called us on it.By the time we were bought, we had done this three times, so wewere on Version 4.  Version 4.1 if I remember correctly.  AfterViaweb became Yahoo Store, there was no longer such a desperateneed for publicity, so although the software continued to evolve,the whole idea of version numbers was quietly dropped.BugsThe other major technical advantage of Web-based software is thatyou can reproduce most bugs.  You have the users\\' data right thereon your disk.  If someone breaks your software, you don\\'t have totry to guess what\\'s going on, as you would with desktop software:you should be able to reproduce the error while they\\'re on thephone with you.  You might even know about it already, if you havecode for noticing errors built into your application.Web-based software gets used round the clock, so everything you dois immediately put through the wringer.  Bugs turn up quickly.Software companies are sometimes accused of letting the users debugtheir software.  And that is just what I\\'m advocating.  For Web-basedsoftware it\\'s actually a good plan, because the bugs are fewer andtransient.  When you release software gradually you get far fewerbugs to start with.  And when you can reproduce errors and releasechanges instantly, you can find and fix most bugs as soon as theyappear.  We never had enough bugs at any one time to bother witha formal bug-tracking system.You should test changes before you release them, of course, so nomajor bugs should get released.  Those few that inevitably slipthrough will involve borderline cases and will only affect the fewusers that encounter them before someone calls in to complain.  Aslong as you fix bugs right away, the net effect, for the averageuser, is far fewer bugs.  I doubt the average Viaweb user ever sawa bug.Fixing fresh bugs is easier than fixing old ones.  It\\'s usuallyfairly quick to find a bug in code you just wrote.  When it turnsup you often know what\\'s wrong before you even look at the source,because you were already worrying about it subconsciously. Fixinga bug in something you wrote six months ago (the average case ifyou release once a year) is a lot more work.  And since you don\\'tunderstand the code as well, you\\'re more likely to fix it in anugly way, or even introduce more bugs. [4]When you catch bugs early, you also get fewer compound bugs.Compound bugs are two separate bugs that interact:  you trip goingdownstairs, and when you reach for the handrail it comes off inyour hand.  In software this kind of bug is the hardest to find,and also tends to have the worst consequences. [5]  The traditional\"break everything and then filter out the bugs\" approach inherentlyyields a lot of compound bugs.  And software that\\'s released in aseries of small changes inherently tends not to. The floors areconstantly being swept clean of any loose objects that might laterget stuck in something.It helps if you use a technique called functional programming.Functional programming means avoiding side-effects.  It\\'s somethingyou\\'re more likely to see in research papers than commercialsoftware, but for Web-based applications it turns out to be reallyuseful.  It\\'s hard to write entire programs as purely functionalcode, but you can write substantial chunks this way.  It makesthose parts of your software easier to test, because they have nostate, and that is very convenient in a situation where you areconstantly making and testing small modifications.  I wrote muchof Viaweb\\'s editor in this style, and we made our scripting language,RTML, a purely functional language.People from the desktop software business will find this hard tocredit, but at Viaweb bugs became almost a game.  Since most releasedbugs involved borderline cases, the users who encountered them werelikely to be advanced users, pushing the envelope.  Advanced usersare more forgiving about bugs, especially since you probablyintroduced them in the course of adding some feature they wereasking for.  In fact, because bugs were rare and you had to bedoing sophisticated things to see them, advanced users were oftenproud to catch one.  They would call support in a spirit more oftriumph than anger, as if they had scored points off us.SupportWhen you can reproduce errors, it changes your approach to customersupport.  At most software companies, support is offered as a wayto make customers feel better.  They\\'re either calling you abouta known bug, or they\\'re just doing something wrong and you have tofigure out what.  In either case there\\'s not much you can learnfrom them.  And so you tend to view support calls as a pain in theass that you want to isolate from your developers as much aspossible.This was not how things worked at Viaweb.  At Viaweb, support wasfree, because we wanted to hear from customers.  If someone had aproblem, we wanted to know about it right away so that we couldreproduce the error and release a fix.So at Viaweb the developers were always in close contact withsupport.  The customer support people were about thirty feet awayfrom the programmers, and knew that they could always interruptanything with a report of a genuine bug.  We would leave a boardmeeting to fix a serious bug.Our approach to support made everyone happier.  The customers weredelighted.  Just imagine how it would feel to call a support lineand be treated as someone bringing important news.  The customersupport people liked it because it meant they could help the users,instead of reading scripts to them.  And the programmers liked itbecause they could reproduce bugs instead of just hearing vaguesecond-hand reports about them.Our policy of fixing bugs on the fly changed the relationshipbetween customer support people and hackers.  At most softwarecompanies, support people are underpaid human shields, and hackersare little copies of God the Father, creators of the world.  Whateverthe procedure for reporting bugs, it is likely to be one-directional:support people who hear about bugs fill out some form that eventuallygets passed on (possibly via QA) to programmers, who put it ontheir list of things to do.  It was very different at Viaweb.Within a minute of hearing about a bug from a customer, the supportpeople could be standing next to a programmer hearing him say \"Shit,you\\'re right, it\\'s a bug.\" It delighted the support people to hearthat \"you\\'re right\" from the hackers.  They used to bring us bugswith the same expectant air as a cat bringing you a mouse it hasjust killed.   It also made them more careful in judging theseriousness of a bug, because now their honor was on the line.After we were bought by Yahoo, the customer support people weremoved far away from the programmers.  It was only then that werealized that they were effectively QA and to some extent marketingas well.  In addition to catching bugs, they were the keepers ofthe knowledge of vaguer, buglike things, like features that confusedusers. [6]  They were also a kind of proxy focus group; we couldask them which of two new features users wanted more, and they werealways right.MoraleBeing able to release software immediately is a big motivator.Often as I was walking to work I would think of some change I wantedto make to the software, and do it that day.  This worked for biggerfeatures as well.  Even if something was going to take two weeksto write (few projects took longer), I knew I could see the effectin the software as soon as it was done.If I\\'d had to wait a year for the next release, I would have shelvedmost of these ideas, for a while at least.  The thing about ideas,though, is that they lead to more ideas.  Have you ever noticedthat when you sit down to write something, half the ideas that endup in it are ones you thought of while writing it?  The same thinghappens with software.  Working to implement one idea gives youmore ideas.  So shelving an idea costs you not only that delay inimplementing it, but also all the ideas that implementing it wouldhave led to.  In fact, shelving an idea probably even inhibits newideas: as you start to think of some new feature, you catch sightof the shelf and think \"but I already have a lot of new things Iwant to do for the next release.\"What big companies do instead of implementing features is planthem.  At Viaweb we sometimes ran into trouble on this account.Investors and analysts would ask us what we had planned for thefuture.  The truthful answer would have been, we didn\\'t have anyplans.  We had general ideas about things we wanted to improve,but if we knew how we would have done it already.  What were wegoing to do in the next six months? Whatever looked like the biggestwin.  I don\\'t know if I ever dared give this answer, but that wasthe truth.  Plans are just another word for ideas on the shelf.When we thought of good ideas, we implemented them.At Viaweb, as at many software companies, most code had one definiteowner.  But when you owned something you really owned it: no oneexcept the owner of a piece of software had to approve (or evenknow about) a release.  There was no protection against breakageexcept the fear of looking like an idiot to one\\'s peers, and thatwas more than enough.  I may have given the impression that we justblithely plowed forward writing code.  We did go fast, but wethought very carefully before we released software onto thoseservers.  And paying attention is more important to reliabilitythan moving slowly.  Because he pays close attention, a Navy pilotcan land a 40,000 lb. aircraft at 140 miles per hour on a pitchingcarrier deck, at night, more safely than the average teenager cancut a bagel.This way of writing software is a double-edged sword of course.It works a lot better for a small team of good, trusted programmersthan it would for a big company of mediocre ones, where bad ideasare caught by committees instead of the people that had them.Brooks in ReverseFortunately, Web-based software does require fewer programmers.I once worked for a medium-sized desktop software company that hadover 100 people working in engineering as a whole.  Only 13 ofthese were in product development.  All the rest were working onreleases, ports, and so on.  With Web-based software, all you need(at most) are the 13 people, because there are no releases, ports,and so on.Viaweb was written by just three people. [7]  I was always underpressure to hire more, because we wanted to get bought, and we knewthat buyers would have a hard time paying a high price for a companywith only three programmers.  (Solution:  we hired more, but creatednew projects for them.)When you can write software with fewer programmers, it saves youmore than money.  As Fred Brooks pointed out inThe MythicalMan-Month,adding people to a project tends to slow it down.  Thenumber of possible connections between developers grows exponentiallywith the size of the group.  The larger the group, the more timethey\\'ll spend in meetings negotiating how their software will worktogether, and the more bugs they\\'ll get from unforeseen interactions.Fortunately, this process also works in reverse: as groups getsmaller, software development gets exponentially more efficient.I can\\'t remember the programmers at Viaweb ever having an actualmeeting.  We never had more to say at any one time than we couldsay as we were walking to lunch.If there is a downside here, it is that all the programmers haveto be to some degree system administrators as well.  When you\\'rehosting software, someone has to be watching the servers, and inpractice the only people who can do this properly are the ones whowrote the software.  At Viaweb our system had so many componentsand changed so frequently that there was no definite border betweensoftware and infrastructure.  Arbitrarily declaring such a borderwould have constrained our design choices.  And so although we wereconstantly hoping that one day (\"in a couple months\") everythingwould be stable enough that we could hire someone whose job wasjust to worry about the servers, it never happened.I don\\'t think it could be any other way, as long as you\\'re stillactively developing the product.  Web-based software is never goingto be something you write, check in, and go home.  It\\'s a livething, running on your servers right now.  A bad bug might not justcrash one user\\'s process; it could crash them all.  If a bug inyour code corrupts some data on disk, you have to fix it.  And soon.  We found that you don\\'t have to watch the servers every minute(after the first year or so), but you definitely want to keep aneye on things you\\'ve changed recently.  You don\\'t release code lateat night and then go home.Watching UsersWith server-based software, you\\'re in closer touch with your code.You can also be in closer touch with your users.  Intuit is famousfor introducing themselves to customers at retail stores and askingto follow them home.  If you\\'ve ever watched someone use yoursoftware for the first time, you know what surprises must haveawaited them.Software should do what users think it will.  But you can\\'t haveany idea what users will be thinking, believe me, until you watchthem.  And server-based software gives you unprecedented informationabout their behavior.  You\\'re not limited to small, artificialfocus groups.  You can see every click made by every user.  Youhave to consider carefully what you\\'re going to look at, becauseyou don\\'t want to violate users\\' privacy, but even the most generalstatistical sampling can be very useful.When you have the users on your server, you don\\'t have to rely onbenchmarks, for example.  Benchmarks are simulated users.  Withserver-based software, you can watch actual users.  To decide whatto optimize, just log into a server and see what\\'s consuming allthe CPU.  And you know when to stop optimizing too: we eventuallygot the Viaweb editor to the point where it was memory-bound ratherthan CPU-bound, and since there was nothing we could do to decreasethe size of users\\' data (well, nothing easy), we knew we might aswell stop there.Efficiency matters for server-based software, because you\\'re payingfor the hardware.  The number of users you can support per serveris the divisor of your capital cost, so if you can make your softwarevery efficient you can undersell competitors and still make aprofit.  At Viaweb we got the capital cost per user down to about$5.  It would be less now, probably less than the cost of sendingthem the first month\\'s bill.  Hardware is free now, if your softwareis reasonably efficient.Watching users can guide you in design as well as optimization.Viaweb had a scripting language called RTML that let advanced usersdefine their own page styles.  We found that RTML became a kind ofsuggestion box, because users only used it when the predefined pagestyles couldn\\'t do what they wanted.  Originally the editor putbutton bars across the page, for example, but after a number ofusers used RTML to put buttons down the leftside, we made that anoption (in fact the default) in the predefined page styles.Finally, by watching users you can often tell when they\\'re introuble.  And since the customer is always right, that\\'s a sign ofsomething you need to fix.  At Viaweb the key to getting users wasthe online test drive.  It was not just a series of slides builtby marketing people.  In our test drive, users actually used thesoftware.  It took about five minutes, and at the end of it theyhad built a real, working store.The test drive was the way we got nearly all our new users.  Ithink it will be the same for most Web-based applications.   Ifusers can get through a test drive successfully, they\\'ll like theproduct.  If they get confused or bored, they won\\'t.  So anythingwe could do to get more people through the test drive would increaseour growth rate.I studied click trails of people taking the test drive and foundthat at a certain step they would get confused and click on thebrowser\\'s Back button.  (If you try writing Web-based applications,you\\'ll find that the Back button becomes one of your most interestingphilosophical problems.) So I added a message at that point, tellingusers that they were nearly finished, and reminding them not toclick on the Back button.  Another great thing about Web-basedsoftware is that you get instant feedback from changes:  the numberof people completing the test drive rose immediately from 60% to90%.  And since the number of new users was a function of the numberof completed test drives, our revenue growth increased by 50%, justfrom that change.MoneyIn the early 1990s I read an article in which someone said thatsoftware was a subscription business.  At first this seemed a verycynical statement.  But later I realized that it reflects reality:software development is an ongoing process.  I think it\\'s cleanerif you openly charge subscription fees, instead of forcing peopleto keep buying and installing new versions so that they\\'ll keeppaying you.  And fortunately, subscriptions are the natural way tobill for Web-based applications.Hosting applications is an area where companies will play a rolethat is not likely to be filled by freeware.  Hosting applicationsis a lot of stress, and has real expenses.  No one is going to wantto do it for free.For companies, Web-based applications are an ideal source of revenue.Instead of starting each quarter with a blank slate, you have arecurring revenue stream.  Because your software evolves gradually,you don\\'t have to worry that a new model will flop; there neverneed be a new model, per se, and if you do something to the softwarethat users hate, you\\'ll know right away.  You have no trouble withuncollectable bills; if someone won\\'t pay you can just turn offthe service.  And there is no possibility of piracy.That last \"advantage\" may turn out to be a problem.  Some amountof piracy is to the advantage of software companies.  If some userreally would not have bought your software at any price, you haven\\'tlost anything if he uses a pirated copy.  In fact you gain, becausehe is one more user helping to make your software the standard--or who might buy a copy later, when he graduates from high school.When they can, companies like to do something called pricediscrimination, which means charging each customer as much as theycan afford. [8] Software is particularly suitable for pricediscrimination, because the marginal cost is close to zero.  Thisis why some software costs more to run on Suns than on Intel boxes:a company that uses Suns is not interested in saving money and cansafely be charged more.  Piracy is effectively the lowest tier ofprice discrimination.  I think that software companies understandthis and deliberately turn a blind eye to some kinds of piracy. [9] With server-based software they are going to have to come up with some other solution.Web-based software sells well, especially in comparison to desktopsoftware, because it\\'s easy to buy.  You might think that peopledecide to buy something, and then buy it, as two separate steps.That\\'s what I thought before Viaweb, to the extent I thought aboutthe question at all.  In fact the second step can propagate backinto the first: if something is hard to buy, people will changetheir mind about whether they wanted it.  And vice versa: you\\'llsell more of something when it\\'s easy to buy.  I buy more booksbecause Amazon exists.  Web-based software is just about the easiestthing in the world to buy, especially if you have just done anonline demo.  Users should not have to do much more than enter acredit card number.  (Make them do more at your peril.)Sometimes Web-based software is offered through ISPs acting asresellers.  This is a bad idea.  You have to be administering theservers, because you need to be constantly improving both hardwareand software.  If you give up direct control of the servers, yougive up most of the advantages of developing Web-based applications.Several of our competitors shot themselves in the foot this way--usually, I think, because they were overrun by suits who wereexcited about this huge potential channel, and didn\\'t realize thatit would ruin the product they hoped to sell through it.  SellingWeb-based software through ISPs is like selling sushi throughvending machines.CustomersWho will the customers be?  At Viaweb they were initially individualsand smaller companies, and I think this will be the rule withWeb-based applications.  These are the users who are ready to trynew things, partly because they\\'re more flexible, and partly becausethey want the lower costs of new technology.Web-based applications will often be the best thing for big companiestoo (though they\\'ll be slow to realize it).  The best intranet isthe Internet.  If a company uses true Web-based applications, thesoftware will work better, the servers will be better administered,and employees will have access to the system from anywhere.The argument against this approach usually hinges on security: ifaccess is easier for employees, it will be for bad guys too.  Somelarger merchants were reluctant to use Viaweb because they thoughtcustomers\\' credit card information would be safer on their ownservers.  It was not easy to make this point diplomatically, butin fact the data was almost certainly safer in our hands thantheirs.  Who can hire better people to manage security, a technologystartup whose whole business is running servers, or a clothingretailer?  Not only did we have better people worrying aboutsecurity, we worried more about it.  If someone broke into theclothing retailer\\'s servers, it would affect at most one merchant,could probably be hushed up, and in the worst case might get oneperson fired.  If someone broke into ours, it could affect thousandsof merchants, would probably end up as news on CNet, and could putus out of business.If you want to keep your money safe, do you keep it under yourmattress at home, or put it in a bank? This argument applies toevery aspect of server administration:  not just security, butuptime, bandwidth, load management, backups, etc.  Our existencedepended on doing these things right.  Server problems were thebig no-no for us, like a dangerous toy would be for a toy maker,or a salmonella outbreak for a food processor.A big company that uses Web-based applications is to that extentoutsourcing IT.  Drastic as it sounds, I think this is generallya good idea.  Companies are likely to get better service this waythan they would from in-house system administrators.  Systemadministrators can become cranky and unresponsive because they\\'renot directly exposed to competitive pressure:  a salesman has todeal with customers, and a developer has to deal with competitors\\'software, but a system administrator, like an old bachelor, hasfew external forces to keep him in line. [10]  At Viaweb we hadexternal forces in plenty to keep us in line. The people callingus were customers, not just co-workers.  If a server got wedged,we jumped; just thinking about it gives me a jolt of adrenaline,years later.So Web-based applications will ordinarily be the right answer forbig companies too.  They will be the last to realize it, however,just as they were with desktop computers.  And partly for the samereason: it will be worth a lot of money to convince big companiesthat they need something more expensive.There is always a tendency for rich customers to buy expensivesolutions, even when cheap solutions are better, because the peopleoffering expensive solutions can spend more to sell them.  At Viawebwe were always up against this.  We lost several high-end merchantsto Web consulting firms who convinced them they\\'d be better off ifthey paid half a million dollars for a custom-made online store ontheir own server.  They were, as a rule, not better off, as morethan one discovered when Christmas shopping season came around andloads rose on their server.  Viaweb was a lot more sophisticatedthan what most of these merchants got, but we couldn\\'t afford totell them.  At $300 a month, we couldn\\'t afford to send a team ofwell-dressed and authoritative-sounding people to make presentationsto customers.A large part of what big companies pay extra for is the cost ofselling expensive things to them.  (If the Defense Department paysa thousand dollars for toilet seats, it\\'s partly because it costsa lot to sell toilet seats for a thousand dollars.)  And this isone reason intranet software will continue to thrive, even thoughit is probably a bad idea.  It\\'s simply more expensive.  There isnothing you can do about this conundrum, so the best plan is to gofor the smaller customers first.  The rest will come in time.Son of ServerRunning software on the server is nothing new.  In fact it\\'s theold model: mainframe applications are all server-based.  Ifserver-based software is such a good idea, why did it lose lasttime?  Why did desktop computers eclipse mainframes?At first desktop computers didn\\'t look like much of a threat.  Thefirst users were all hackers-- or hobbyists, as they were calledthen.  They liked microcomputers because they were cheap.  For thefirst time, you could have your own computer.  The phrase \"personalcomputer\" is part of the language now, but when it was first usedit had a deliberately audacious sound, like the phrase \"personalsatellite\" would today.Why did desktop computers take over? I think it was because theyhad better software.  And I think the reason microcomputer softwarewas better was that it could be written by small companies.I don\\'t think many people realize how fragile and tentative startupsare in the earliest stage.  Many startups begin almost by accident--as a couple guys, either with day jobs or in school, writing aprototype of something that might, if it looks promising, turn intoa company. At this larval stage, any significant obstacle will stopthe startup dead in its tracks.  Writing mainframe software requiredtoo much commitment up front.  Development machines were expensive,and because the customers would be big companies, you\\'d need animpressive-looking sales force to sell it to them.  Starting astartup to write mainframe software would be a much more seriousundertaking than just hacking something together on your Apple IIin the evenings.  And so you didn\\'t get a lot of startups writingmainframe applications.The arrival of desktop computers inspired a lot of new software,because writing applications for them seemed an attainable goal tolarval startups.  Development was cheap, and the customers wouldbe individual people that you could reach through computer storesor even by mail-order.The application that pushed desktop computers out into the mainstreamwasVisiCalc, the first spreadsheet.  It was written by two guysworking in an attic, and yet did things no mainframe software coulddo. [11]  VisiCalc was such an advance, in its time, that peoplebought Apple IIs just to run it.  And this was the beginning of atrend: desktop computers won because startups wrote software forthem.It looks as if server-based software will be good this time around,because startups will write it.  Computers are so cheap now thatyou can get started, as we did, using a desktop computer as aserver.  Inexpensive processors have eaten the workstation market(you rarely even hear the word now) and are most of the way throughthe server market; Yahoo\\'s servers, which deal with loads as highas any on the Internet, all have the same inexpensive Intel processorsthat you have in your desktop machine.  And once you\\'ve writtenthe software, all you need to sell it is a Web site.  Nearly allour users came direct to our site through word of mouth and referencesin the press. [12]Viaweb was a typical larval startup.  We were terrified of startinga company, and for the first few months comforted ourselves bytreating the whole thing as an experiment that we might call offat any moment.  Fortunately, there were few obstacles excepttechnical ones.  While we were writing the software, our Web serverwas the same desktop machine we used for development, connected tothe outside world by a dialup line.  Our only expenses in thatphase were food and rent.There is all the more reason for startups to write Web-based softwarenow, because writing desktop software has become a lot less fun.If you want to write desktop software now you do it on Microsoft\\'sterms, calling their APIs and working around their buggy OS.  Andif you manage to write something that takes off, you may find thatyou were merely doing market research for Microsoft.If a company wants to make a platform that startups will build on,they have to make it something that hackers themselves will wantto use.   That means it has to be inexpensive and well-designed.The Mac was popular with hackers when it first came out, and a lotof them wrote software for it. [13] You see this less with Windows,because hackers don\\'t use it.  The kind of people who are good atwriting software tend to be running Linux or FreeBSD now.I don\\'t think we would have started a startup to write desktopsoftware, because desktop software has to run on Windows, and beforewe could write software for Windows we\\'d have to use it.  The Web let us do an end-run around Windows, and deliver software running on Unix direct to users through the browser.  That is a liberating prospect, a lot like the arrival of PCs twenty-five years ago.MicrosoftBack when desktop computers arrived, IBM was the giant that everyonewas afraid of.  It\\'s hard to imagine now, but I remember the feelingvery well.  Now the frightening giant is Microsoft, and I don\\'tthink they are as blind to the threat facing them as IBM was.After all, Microsoft deliberately built their business in IBM\\'sblind spot.I mentioned earlier that my mother doesn\\'t really need a desktopcomputer.  Most users probably don\\'t.  That\\'s a problem for Microsoft,and they know it.  If applications run on remote servers, no oneneeds Windows.  What will Microsoft do?  Will they be able to usetheir control of the desktop to prevent, or constrain, this newgeneration of software?My guess is that Microsoft will develop some kind of server/desktophybrid, where the operating system works together with servers theycontrol.  At a minimum, files will be centrally available for userswho want that.  I don\\'t expect Microsoft to go all the way to theextreme of doing the computations on the server, with only a browserfor a client, if they can avoid it. If you only need a browser fora client, you don\\'t need Microsoft on the client, and if Microsoftdoesn\\'t control the client, they can\\'t push users towards theirserver-based applications.I think Microsoft will have a hard time keeping the genie in thebottle.  There will be too many different types of clients for themto control them all.  And if Microsoft\\'s applications only workwith some clients, competitors will be able to trump them by offeringapplications that work from any client. [14]In a world of Web-based applications, there is no automatic placefor Microsoft.  They may succeed in making themselves a place, butI don\\'t think they\\'ll dominate this new world as they did the worldof desktop applications.It\\'s not so much that a competitor will trip them up as that theywill trip over themselves.  With the rise of Web-based software,they will be facing not just technical problems but their ownwishful thinking.  What they need to do is cannibalize their existingbusiness, and I can\\'t see them facing that.  The same single-mindednessthat has brought them this far will now be working against them.IBM was in exactly the same situation, and they could not masterit.  IBM made a late and half-hearted entry into the microcomputerbusiness because they were ambivalent about threatening their cashcow, mainframe computing.  Microsoft will likewise be hampered bywanting to save the desktop.  A cash cow can be a damned heavymonkey on your back.I\\'m not saying that no one will dominate server-based applications.Someone probably will eventually.  But I think that there will bea good long period of cheerful chaos, just as there was in theearly days of microcomputers.  That was a good time for startups.Lots of small companies flourished, and did it by making coolthings.Startups but More SoThe classic startup is fast and informal, with few people and littlemoney.  Those few people work very hard, and technology magnifiesthe effect of the decisions they make.  If they win, they win big.In a startup writing Web-based applications, everything you associatewith startups is taken to an extreme.  You can write and launch aproduct with even fewer people and even less money.  You have tobe even faster, and you can get away with being more informal.You can literally launch your product as three guys sitting in theliving room of an apartment, and a server collocated at an ISP.We did.Over time the teams have gotten smaller, faster, and more informal.In 1960, software development meant a roomful of men with hornrimmed glasses and narrow black neckties, industriously writingten lines of code a day on IBM coding forms.  In 1980, it was ateam of eight to ten people wearing jeans to the office and typinginto vt100s.  Now it\\'s a couple of guys sitting in a living roomwith laptops.  (And jeans turn out not to be the last word ininformality.)Startups are stressful, and this, unfortunately, is also taken toan extreme with Web-based applications.  Many software companies, especially at the beginning, have periodswhere the developers slept under their desks and so on.  The alarmingthing about Web-based software is that there is nothing to preventthis becoming the default.  The stories about sleeping under desksusually end:  then at last we shipped it and we all went home andslept for a week.  Web-based software never ships.  You can work16-hour days for as long as you want to.  And because you can, andyour competitors can, you tend to be forced to.  You can, so youmust.  It\\'s Parkinson\\'s Law running in reverse.The worst thing is not the hours but the responsibility.  Programmersand system administrators traditionally each have their own separateworries.  Programmers have to worry about bugs, and systemadministrators have to worry about infrastructure.  Programmersmay spend a long day up to their elbows in source code, but at somepoint they get to go home and forget about it.  System administratorsnever quite leave the job behind, but when they do get paged at4:00 AM, they don\\'t usually have to do anything very complicated.With Web-based applications, these two kinds of stress get combined.The programmers become system administrators, but without thesharply defined limits that ordinarily make the job bearable.At Viaweb we spent the first six months just writing software.  Weworked the usual long hours of an early startup.  In a desktopsoftware company, this would have been the part where we wereworking hard, but it felt like a vacation compared to the nextphase, when we took users onto our server.  The second biggestbenefit of selling Viaweb to Yahoo (after the money) was to be ableto dump ultimate responsibility for the whole thing onto theshoulders of a big company.Desktop software forces users to become system administrators.Web-based software forces programmers to.  There is less stress intotal, but more for the programmers.  That\\'s not necessarily badnews.  If you\\'re a startup competing with a big company, it\\'s goodnews. [15]  Web-based applications offer a straightforward way tooutwork your competitors.  No startup asks for more.Just Good EnoughOne thing that might deter you from writing Web-based applicationsis the lameness of Web pages as a UI.  That is a problem, I admit.There were a few things we would havereallyliked to add toHTML and HTTP.  What matters, though, is that Web pages are justgood enough.There is a parallel here with the first microcomputers.  Theprocessors in those machines weren\\'t actually intended to be theCPUs of computers.  They were designed to be used in things liketraffic lights.  But guys like Ed Roberts, who designed theAltair,realized that they were just good enough.  You could combine oneof these chips with some memory (256 bytes in the first Altair),and front panel switches, and you\\'d have a working computer.  Beingable to have your own computer was so exciting that there wereplenty of people who wanted to buy them, however limited.Web pages weren\\'t designed to be a UI for applications, but they\\'rejust good enough.  And for a significant number of users, softwarethat you can use from any browser will be enough of a win in itselfto outweigh any awkwardness in the UI.  Maybe you can\\'t write thebest-looking spreadsheet using HTML, but you can write a spreadsheetthat several people can use simultaneously from different locationswithout special client software, or that can incorporate live datafeeds, or that can page you when certain conditions are triggered.More importantly, you can write new kinds of applications thatdon\\'t even have names yet.  VisiCalc was not merely a microcomputerversion of a mainframe application, after all-- it was a new typeof application.Of course, server-based applications don\\'t have to be Web-based.You could have some other kind of client.  But I\\'m pretty surethat\\'s a bad idea.  It would be very convenient if you could assumethat everyone would install your client-- so convenient that youcould easily convince yourself that they all would-- but if theydon\\'t, you\\'re hosed.  Because Web-based software assumes nothingabout the client, it will work anywhere the Web works.  That\\'s abig advantage already, and the advantage will grow as new Webdevices proliferate.  Users will like you because your softwarejust works, and your life will be easier because you won\\'t have totweak it for every new client.[16]I feel like I\\'ve watched the evolution of the Web as closely asanyone, and I can\\'t predict what\\'s going to happen with clients.Convergence is probably coming, but where?  I can\\'t pick a winner.One thing I can predict is conflict between AOL and Microsoft.Whatever Microsoft\\'s .NET turns out to be, it will probably involveconnecting the desktop to servers.  Unless AOL fights back, theywill either be pushed aside or turned into a pipe between Microsoftclient and server software.  If Microsoft and AOL get into a clientwar, the only thing sure to work on both will be browsing the Web,meaning Web-based applications will be the only kind that workeverywhere.How will it all play out?  I don\\'t know.  And you don\\'t have toknow if you bet on Web-based applications.  No one can break thatwithout breaking browsing.  The Web may not be the only way todeliver software, but it\\'s one that works now and will continue towork for a long time.  Web-based applications are cheap to develop,and easy for even the smallest startup to deliver.  They\\'re a lotof work, and of a particularly stressful kind, but that only makesthe odds better for startups.Why Not?E. B. White was amused to learn from a farmer friend that manyelectrified fences don\\'t have any current running through them.The cows apparently learn to stay away from them, and after thatyou don\\'t need the current.  \"Rise up, cows!\" he wrote, \"Take yourliberty while despots snore!\"If you\\'re a hacker who has thought of one day starting a startup,there are probably two things keeping you from doing it.  One isthat you don\\'t know anything about business.  The other is thatyou\\'re afraid of competition.  Neither of these fences have anycurrent in them.There are only two things you have to know about business:  buildsomething users love, and make more than you spend.  If you getthese two right, you\\'ll be ahead of most startups.  You can figureout the rest as you go.You may not at first make more than you spend, but as long as thegap is closing fast enough you\\'ll be ok.  If you start out underfunded,it will at least encourage a habit of frugality.  The less youspend, the easier it is to make more than you spend.  Fortunately,it can be very cheap to launch a Web-based application.  We launchedon under $10,000, and it would be even cheaper today.  We had tospend thousands on a server, and thousands more to get SSL.  (Theonly company selling SSL software at the time was Netscape.)  Nowyou can rent a much more powerful server, with SSL included, forless than we paid for bandwidth alone.  You could launch a Web-basedapplication now for less than the cost of a fancy office chair.As for building something users love, here are some general tips.Start by making something clean and simple that you would want touse yourself.  Get a version 1.0 out fast, then continue to improvethe software, listening closely to the users as you do.  The customeris always right, but different customers are right about differentthings; the least sophisticated users show you what you need tosimplify and clarify, and the most sophisticated tell you whatfeatures you need to add. The best thing software can be is easy,but the way to do this is to get the defaults right, not to limitusers\\' choices.  Don\\'t get complacent if your competitors\\' softwareis lame; the standard to compare your software to is what it couldbe, not what your current competitors happen to have.  Use yoursoftware yourself, all the time.  Viaweb was supposed to be anonline store builder, but we used it to make our own site too.Don\\'t listen to marketing people or designers or product managersjust because of their job titles.  If they have good ideas, usethem, but it\\'s up to you to decide; software has to be designed byhackers who understand design, not designers who know a littleabout software.  If you can\\'t design software as well as implementit, don\\'t start a startup.Now let\\'s talk about competition.  What you\\'re afraid of is notpresumably groups of hackers like you, but actual companies, withoffices and business plans and salesmen and so on, right?  Well,they are more afraid of you than you are of them, and they\\'re right.It\\'s a lot easier for a couple of hackers to figure out how to rentoffice space or hire sales people than it is for a company of anysize to get software written.  I\\'ve been on both sides, and I know.When Viaweb was bought by Yahoo, I suddenly found myself workingfor a big company, and it was like trying to run through waist-deepwater.I don\\'t mean to disparage Yahoo.  They had some good hackers, andthe top management were real butt-kickers.  For a big company, theywere exceptional.  But they were still only about a tenth asproductive as a small startup.  No big company can do much betterthan that.  What\\'s scary about Microsoft is that a company sobig can develop software at all.  They\\'re like a mountain thatcan walk.Don\\'t be intimidated.  You can do as much that Microsoft can\\'t asthey can do that you can\\'t.  And no one can stop you.  You don\\'thave to ask anyone\\'s permission to develop Web-based applications.You don\\'t have to do licensing deals, or get shelf space in retailstores, or grovel to have your application bundled with the OS.You can deliver software right to the browser, and no one can getbetween you and potential users without preventing them from browsingthe Web.You may not believe it, but I promise you, Microsoft is scared ofyou.  The complacent middle managers may not be, but Bill is,because he was you once, back in 1975, the last time a new way ofdelivering software appeared.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'A good programmer working intensively on his own code can hold itin his mind the way a mathematician holds a problem he\\'s workingon.  Mathematicians don\\'t answer questions by working them out onpaper the way schoolchildren are taught to.  They do more in theirheads: they try to understand a problem space well enough that theycan walk around it the way you can walk around the memory of thehouse you grew up in.  At its best programming is the same.  Youhold the whole program in your head, and you can manipulate it atwill.That\\'s particularly valuable at the start of a project, becauseinitially the most important thing is to be able to change whatyou\\'re doing.  Not just to solve the problem in a different way,but to change the problem you\\'re solving.Your code is your understanding of the problem you\\'re exploring.So it\\'s only when you have your code in your head that you reallyunderstand the problem.It\\'s not easy to get a program into your head.  If you leave aproject for a few months, it can take days to really understand itagain when you return to it.  Even when you\\'re actively working ona program it can take half an hour to load into your head when youstart work each day.  And that\\'s in the best case.  Ordinaryprogrammers working in typical office conditions never enter thismode.  Or to put it more dramatically, ordinary programmers workingin typical office conditions never really understand the problemsthey\\'re solving.Even the best programmers don\\'t always have the whole program they\\'reworking on loaded into their heads.   But there are things you cando to help:Avoid distractions.Distractions are bad for many types of work,   but especially bad for programming, because programmers tend to   operate at the limit of the detail they can handle.The danger of a distraction depends not on how long it is, but   on how much it scrambles your brain.  A programmer can leave the   office and go and get a sandwich without losing the code in his   head.  But the wrong kind of interruption can wipe your brain   in 30 seconds.Oddly enough, scheduled distractions may be worse than unscheduled   ones.  If you know you have a meeting in an hour, you don\\'t even   start working on something hard.Work in long stretches.Since there\\'s a fixed cost each time   you start working on a program, it\\'s more efficient to work in   a few long sessions than many short ones.  There will of course   come a point where you get stupid because you\\'re tired.  This   varies from person to person.  I\\'ve heard of people hacking for   36 hours straight, but the most I\\'ve ever been able to manage   is about 18, and I work best in chunks of no more than 12.The optimum is not the limit you can physically endure.  There\\'s   an advantage as well as a cost of breaking up a project.  Sometimes   when you return to a problem after a rest, you find your unconscious   mind has left an answer waiting for you.Use succinct languages.Morepowerfulprogramming languages   make programs shorter. And programmers seem to think of programs   at least partially in the language they\\'re using to write them.   The more succinct the language, the shorter the program, and the   easier it is to load and keep in your head.You can magnify the effect of a powerful language by using a   style called bottom-up programming, where you write programs in   multiple layers, the lower ones acting as programming languages   for those above.  If you do this right, you only have to keep   the topmost layer in your head.Keep rewriting your program.Rewriting a program often yields   a cleaner design.  But it would have advantages even if it didn\\'t:   you have to understand a program completely to rewrite it, so   there is no better way to get one loaded into your head.Write rereadable code.All programmers know it\\'s good to write   readable code.  But you yourself are the most important reader.   Especially in the beginning; a prototype is a conversation with   yourself.  And when writing for yourself you have different   priorities.  If you\\'re writing for other people, you may not   want to make code too dense.  Some parts of a program may be   easiest to read if you spread things out, like an introductory    textbook.  Whereas if you\\'re writing code to make it easy to reload    into your head, it may be best to go for brevity.Work in small groups.When you manipulate a program in your   head, your vision tends to stop at the edge of the code you own.   Other parts you don\\'t understand as well, and more importantly,   can\\'t take liberties with.  So the smaller the number of   programmers, the more completely a project can mutate.  If there\\'s   just one programmer, as there often is at first, you can do   all-encompassing redesigns.Don\\'t have multiple people editing the same piece of code.You   never understand other people\\'s code as well as your own.  No   matter how thoroughly you\\'ve read it, you\\'ve only read it, not   written it.  So if a piece of code is written by multiple authors,   none of them understand it as well as a single author would.And of course you can\\'t safely redesign something other people   are working on.  It\\'s not just that you\\'d have to ask permission.   You don\\'t even let yourself think of such things.  Redesigning   code with several authors is like changing laws; redesigning   code you alone control is like seeing the other interpretation   of an ambiguous image.If you want to put several people to work on a project, divide   it into components and give each to one person.Start small.A program gets easier to hold in your head as you   become familiar with it.  You can start to treat parts as black   boxes once you feel confident you\\'ve fully explored them.  But   when you first start working on a project, you\\'re forced to see   everything.  If you start with too big a problem, you may never   quite be able to encompass it.  So if you need to write a big,   complex program, the best way to begin may not be to write a   spec for it, but to write a prototype that solves a subset of   the problem.  Whatever the advantages of planning, they\\'re often   outweighed by the advantages of being able to keep a program in   your head.It\\'s striking how often programmers manage to hit all eight pointsby accident.  Someone has an idea for a new project, but becauseit\\'s not officially sanctioned, he has to do it in off hours—whichturn out to be more productive because there are no distractions.Driven by his enthusiasm for the new project he works on it formany hours at a stretch.  Because it\\'s initially just anexperiment, instead of a \"production\" language he uses a mere\"scripting\" language—which is in fact far more powerful.  Hecompletely rewrites the program several times; that wouldn\\'t bejustifiable for an official project, but this is a labor of loveand he wants it to be perfect.  And since no one is going to seeit except him, he omits any comments except the note-to-self variety.He works in a small group perforce, because he either hasn\\'t toldanyone else about the idea yet, or it seems so unpromising that noone else is allowed to work on it.  Even if there is a group, theycouldn\\'t have multiple people editing the same code, because itchanges too fast for that to be possible.  And the project startssmall because the ideaissmall at first; he just has some coolhack he wants to try out.Even more striking are the number of officially sanctioned projectsthat manage to doall eight things wrong.  In fact, if you look atthe way software gets written in most organizations, it\\'s almostas if they were deliberately trying to do things wrong. In a sense,they are.  One of the defining qualities of organizations sincethere have been such a thing is to treat individuals as interchangeableparts.  This works well for more parallelizable tasks, like fightingwars.  For most of history a well-drilled army of professionalsoldiers could be counted on to beat an army of individual warriors,no matter how valorous.  But having ideas is not very parallelizable.And that\\'s what programs are: ideas.It\\'s not merely true that organizations dislike the idea of dependingon individual genius, it\\'s a tautology.  It\\'s part of the definitionof an organization not to.  Of our current concept of an organization,at least.Maybe we could define a new kind of organization that combined theefforts of individuals without requiring them to be interchangeable.Arguably a market is such a form of organization, though it may bemore accurate to describe a market as a degenerate case—as whatyou get by default when organization isn\\'t possible.Probably the best we\\'ll do is some kind of hack, like making theprogramming parts of an organization work differently from the rest.Perhaps the optimal solution is for big companies not even to tryto develop ideas in house, but simply tobuythem.  But regardlessof what the solution turns out to be, the first step is to realizethere\\'s a problem.  There is a contradiction in the very phrase\"software company.\"   The two words are pulling in opposite directions.Any good programmer in a large organization is going to be at oddswith it, because organizations are designed to prevent whatprogrammers strive for.Good programmersmanage to get a lot done anyway.  But often itrequires practically an act of rebellion against the organizationsthat employ them.  Perhaps it will help if more people understand that the wayprogrammers behave is driven by the demands of the work they do.It\\'s not because they\\'re irresponsible that they work in long bingesduring which they blow off all other obligations, plunge straight intoprogramming instead of writing specs first, and rewrite code thatalready works.  It\\'s not because they\\'re unfriendly that they preferto work alone, or growl at people who pop their head in the doorto say hello.  This apparently random collection of annoying habitshas a single explanation: the power of holding a program in one\\'shead.Whether or not understanding this can help large organizations, itcan certainly help their competitors.  The weakest point in bigcompanies is that they don\\'t let individual programmers do greatwork.  So if you\\'re a little startup, this is the place to attackthem.  Take on the kind of problems that have to be solved in onebig brain.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'The Future of Startup Funding',\n",
       "  'date': 'Want to start a startup?',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.August 2010Two years ago Iwroteabout what I called \"a huge, unexploitedopportunity in startup funding:\" the growing disconnect betweenVCs, whose current business model requires them to invest largeamounts, and a large class of startups that need less than theyused to.  Increasingly, startups want a couple hundred thousanddollars, not a couple million.The opportunity is a lot less unexploited now.  Investors havepoured into this territory from both directions.  VCs are much morelikely to make angel-sized investments than they were a year ago.And meanwhile the past year has seen a dramatic increase in a newtype of investor: the super-angel, who operates like an angel, butusing other people\\'s money, like a VC.Though a lot of investors are entering this territory, there isstill room for more.  The distribution of investors should mirrorthe distribution of startups, which has the usual power law dropoff.So there should be a lot more people investing tens or hundreds ofthousands than millions.In fact, it may be good for angels that there are more people doingangel-sized deals, because if angel rounds become more legitimate,then startups may start to opt for angel rounds even when theycould, if they wanted, raise series A rounds from VCs.  One reasonstartups prefer series A rounds is that they\\'re more prestigious.But if angel investors become more active and better known, they\\'llincreasingly be able to compete with VCs in brand.Of course, prestige isn\\'t the main reason to prefer a series Around.  A startup will probably get more attention from investorsin a series A round than an angel round.  So if a startup is choosingbetween an angel round and an A round from a good VC fund, I usuallyadvise them to take the A round.But while series A rounds aren\\'t going away, I think VCs should bemore worried about super-angels than vice versa.  Despite theirname, the super-angels are really mini VC funds, and they clearlyhave existing VCs in their sights.They would seem to have history on their side.  The pattern here seems the sameone we see when startups and established companies enter a newmarket.  Online video becomes possible, and YouTube plunges rightin, while existing media companies embrace it only half-willingly,driven more by fear than hope, and aiming more to protect theirturf than to do great things for users.  Ditto for PayPal.  Thispattern is repeated over and over, and it\\'s usually the invaderswho win. In this case the super-angels are the invaders.  Angelrounds are their whole business, as online video was for YouTube.Whereas VCs who make angel investments mostly do it as a way togenerate deal flow for series A rounds.On the other hand, startup investing is a very strange business.Nearly all the returns are concentrated in a few big winners.  Ifthe super-angels merely fail to invest in (and to some extentproduce) the big winners, they\\'ll be out of business, even if theyinvest in all the others.VCsWhy don\\'t VCs start doing smaller series A rounds?  The stickingpoint is board seats.  In a traditional series A round, the partnerwhose deal it is takes a seat on the startup\\'s board.  If we assumethe average startup runs for 6 years and a partner can bear to beon 12 boards at once, then a VC fund can do 2 series A deals perpartner per year.It has always seemed to me the solution is to take fewer boardseats.  You don\\'t have to be on the board to help a startup.  MaybeVCs feel they need the power that comes with board membership toensure their money isn\\'t wasted.  But have they tested that theory?Unless they\\'ve tried not taking board seats and found their returnsare lower, they\\'re not bracketing the problem.I\\'m not saying VCs don\\'t help startups.  The good ones help them alot.  What I\\'m saying is that the kind of help that matters, youmay not have to be a board member to give.How will this all play out?  Some VCs will probably adapt, by doingmore, smaller deals.  I wouldn\\'t be surprised if by streamliningtheir selection process and taking fewer board seats, VC funds coulddo 2 to 3 times as many series A rounds with no loss of quality.But other VCs will make no more than superficial changes.  VCs areconservative, and the threat to them isn\\'t mortal.  The VC fundsthat don\\'t adapt won\\'t be violently displaced.  They\\'ll edge graduallyinto a different business without realizing it.  They\\'ll still dowhat they will call series A rounds, but these will increasinglybe de facto series B rounds.In such rounds they won\\'t get the 25 to 40% of the company they donow.  You don\\'t give up as much of the company in later roundsunless something is seriously wrong.  Since the VCs who don\\'t adaptwill be investing later, their returns from winners may be smaller.But investing later should also mean they have fewer losers.  Sotheir ratio of risk to return may be the same or even better.They\\'ll just have become a different, more conservative, type ofinvestment.AngelsIn the big angel rounds that increasingly compete with series Arounds, the investors won\\'t take as much equity as VCs do now.  AndVCs who try to compete with angels by doing more, smaller dealswill probably find they have to take less equity to do it. Whichis good news for founders: they\\'ll get to keep more of the company.The deal terms of angel rounds will become less restrictivetoo—not just less restrictive than series A terms, but lessrestrictive than angel terms have traditionally been.In the future, angel rounds will less often be for specific amountsor have a lead investor.  In the old days, the standard m.o. forstartups was to find one angel to act as the lead investor.  You\\'dnegotiate a round size and valuation with the lead, who\\'d supplysome but not all of the money.  Then the startup and the lead wouldcooperate to find the rest.The future of angel rounds looks more like this: instead of a fixedround size, startups will do a rolling close, where they take moneyfrom investors one at a time till they feel they have enough.And though there\\'s going to be one investor who gives them the firstcheck, and his or her help in recruiting other investors willcertainly be welcome, this initial investor will no longer be thelead in the old sense of managing the round.  The startup will nowdo that themselves.There will continue to be lead investors in the sense of investorswho take the lead inadvisinga startup.  They may also makethe biggest investment.  But they won\\'t always have to be the oneterms are negotiated with, or be the first money in, as they havein the past.  Standardized paperwork will do away with the need tonegotiate anything except the valuation, and that will get easiertoo.If multiple investors have to share a valuation, it will be whateverthe startup can get from the first one to write a check, limitedby their guess at whether this will make later investors balk.  Butthere may not have to be just one valuation.  Startups are increasinglyraising money on convertible notes, and convertible notes have notvaluations but at most valuationcaps: caps on what theeffective valuation will be when the debt converts to equity (in alater round, or upon acquisition if that happens first).  That\\'san important difference because it means a startup could do multiplenotes at once with different caps.  This is now starting to happen,and I predict it will become more common.SheepThe reason things are moving this way is that the old way suckedfor startups.  Leads could (and did) use a fixed size round as alegitimate-seeming way of saying what all founders hate to hear:I\\'ll invest if other people will.  Most investors, unable to judgestartups for themselves, rely instead on the opinions of otherinvestors.  If everyone wants in, they want in too; if not, not.Founders hate this because it\\'s a recipe for deadlock, and delayis the thing a startup can least afford.  Most investors know thism.o. is lame, and few say openly that they\\'re doing it.  But thecraftier ones achieve the same result by offering to lead roundsof fixed size and supplying only part of the money.  If the startupcan\\'t raise the rest, the lead is out too.  How could they go aheadwith the deal?  The startup would be underfunded!In the future, investors will increasingly be unable to offerinvestment subject to contingencies like other people investing.Or rather, investors who do that will get last place in line.Startups will go to them only to fill up rounds that are mostlysubscribed.  And since hot startups tend to have rounds that areoversubscribed, being last in line means they\\'ll probably miss thehot deals.  Hot deals and successful startups are not identical,but there is a significant correlation.So investors who won\\'t invest unilaterally will have lower returns.Investors will probably find they do better when deprived of thiscrutch anyway.   Chasing hot deals doesn\\'t make investors choosebetter; it just makes them feel better about their choices.  I\\'veseen feeding frenzies both form and fall apart many times, and asfar as I can tell they\\'re mostly random.If investors canno longer rely on their herd instincts, they\\'ll have to think moreabout each startup before investing.  They may be surprised howwell this works.Deadlock wasn\\'t the only disadvantage of letting a lead investormanage an angel round.  The investors would not infrequently colludeto push down the valuation.  And rounds took too long to close,because however motivated the lead was to get the round closed, hewas not a tenth as motivated as the startup.Increasingly, startups are taking charge of their own angel rounds.Only a few do so far, but I think we can already declare the oldway dead, because those few are the best startups.  They\\'re theones in a position to tell investors how the round is going to work.And if the startups you want to invest in do things a certain way,what difference does it make what the others do?TractionIn fact, it may be slightly misleading to say that angel roundswill increasingly take the place of series A rounds.  What\\'s reallyhappening is that startup-controlled rounds are taking the placeof investor-controlled rounds.This is an instance of a very important meta-trend, one that YCombinator itself has been based on from the beginning: foundersare becoming increasingly powerful relative to investors.  So ifyou want to predict what the future of venture funding will be like,just ask: how would founders like it to be?  One by one, all thethings founders dislike about raising money are going to geteliminated.Using that heuristic, I\\'ll predict a couple more things.  One isthat investors will increasingly be unable to wait for startups tohave \"traction\" before they put in significant money.  It\\'s hardto predict in advance which startups will succeed.  So most investorsprefer, if they can, to wait till the startup is already succeeding,then jump in quickly with an offer.  Startups hate this as well,partly because it tends to create deadlock, and partly because itseems kind of slimy.  If you\\'re a promising startup but don\\'t yethave significant growth, all the investors are your friends inwords, but few are in actions.  They all say they love you, butthey all wait to invest. Then when you start to see growth, theyclaim they were your friend all along, and are aghast at the thoughtyou\\'d be so disloyal as to leave them out of your round.  If foundersbecome more powerful, they\\'ll be able to make investors give themmore money upfront.(The worst variant of this behavior is the tranched deal, where theinvestor makes a small initial investment, with more to follow ifthe startup does well.  In effect, this structure gives the investora free option on the next round, which they\\'ll only take if it\\'sworse for the startup than they could get in the open market.Tranched deals are an abuse.  They\\'re increasingly rare, and they\\'regoing to get rarer.)Investors don\\'t like trying to predict which startups will succeed,but increasingly they\\'ll have to.  Though the way that happens won\\'tnecessarily be that the behavior of existing investors will change;it may instead be that they\\'ll be replaced by other investors withdifferent behavior—that investors who understand startupswell enough to take on the hard problem of predicting their trajectorywill tend to displace suits whose skills lie more in raising moneyfrom LPs.SpeedThe other thing founders hate most about fundraising is how longit takes.  So as founders become more powerful, rounds should startto close faster.Fundraising is still terribly distracting for startups. If you\\'rea founder in the middle of raising a round, the round is thetop idea in your mind, which means working on thecompany isn\\'t.  If a round takes 2 months to close, which isreasonably fast by present standards, that means 2 months duringwhich the company is basically treading water.  That\\'s the worstthing a startup could do.So if investors want to get the best deals, the way to do it willbe to close faster.   Investors don\\'t need weeks to make up theirminds anyway.  We decide based on about 10 minutes of reading anapplication plus 10 minutes of in person interview, and we onlyregret about 10% of our decisions.  If we can decide in 20 minutes,surely the next round of investors can decide in a couple days.There are a lot of institutionalized delays in startup funding: themulti-week mating dance with investors; the distinction betweentermsheets and deals; the fact that each series A has enormouslyelaborate, custom paperwork.  Both founders and investors tend totake these for granted.  It\\'s the way things have always been.  Butultimately the reason these delays exist is that they\\'re to theadvantage of investors.  More time gives investors more informationabout a startup\\'s trajectory, and it also tends to make startupsmore pliable in negotiations, since they\\'re usually short of money.These conventions weren\\'t designed to drag out the funding process,but that\\'s why they\\'re allowed to persist.  Slowness is to theadvantage of investors, who have in the past been the ones with themost power.  But there is no need for rounds to take months or evenweeks to close, and once founders realize that, it\\'s going to stop.Not just in angel rounds, but in series A rounds too.  The futureis simple deals with standard terms, done quickly.One minor abuse that will get corrected in the process is optionpools.  In a traditional series A round, before the VCs invest theymake the company set aside a block of stock for future hires—usuallybetween 10 and 30% of the company.  The point is to ensure thisdilution is borne by the existing shareholders.  The practice isn\\'tdishonest; founders know what\\'s going on.  But it makes dealsunnecessarily complicated.  In effect the valuation is 2 numbers.There\\'s no need to keep doing this.The final thing founders want is to be able to sell some oftheir own stock in later rounds.  This won\\'t be a change, because the practice is now quite common.  A lot of investorshated the idea, but the world hasn\\'t exploded as a result,so it will happen more, and more openly.SurpriseI\\'ve talked here about a bunch of changes that will be forced oninvestors as founders become more powerful.  Now the good news:investors may actually make more money as a result.A couple days ago an interviewerasked meif founders having morepower would be better or worse for the world.  I was surprised,because I\\'d never considered that question.  Better or worse, it\\'shappening.  But after a second\\'s reflection, the answer seemedobvious.  Founders understand their companies better than investors,and it has to be better if the people with more knowledge have morepower.One of the mistakes novice pilots make is overcontrolling theaircraft: applying corrections too vigorously, so the aircraftoscillates about the desired configuration instead of approachingit asymptotically.  It seems probable that investors have till nowon average been overcontrolling their portfolio companies.  In alot of startups, the biggest source of stress for the founders isnot competitors but investors.  Certainly it was for us at Viaweb.And this is not a new phenomenon: investors were James Watt\\'s biggestproblem too.   If having less power prevents investors fromovercontrolling startups, it should be better not just for foundersbut for investors too.Investors may end up with less stock per startup, but startups willprobably do better with founders more in control, and there willalmost certainly be more of them.  Investors all compete with oneanother for deals, but they aren\\'t one another\\'s main competitor.Our main competitor is employers.  And so far that competitor iscrushing us.  Only a tiny fraction of people who could start astartup do.  Nearly all customers choose the competing product, ajob.  Why?  Well, let\\'s look at the product we\\'re offering.  Anunbiased review would go something like this:Starting a startup gives you more freedom and the opportunity to  make a lot more money than a job, but it\\'s also hard work and at  times very stressful.Much of the stress comes from dealing with investors.  If reformingthe investment process removed that stress, we\\'d make our productmuch more attractive.  The kind of people who make good startupfounders don\\'t mind dealing with technical problems—they enjoytechnical problems—but they hate the type of problems investorscause.Investors have noidea that when they maltreat one startup, they\\'re preventing 10others from happening, but they are.  Indirectly, but they are.  Sowhen investors stop trying to squeeze a little more out of theirexisting deals, they\\'ll find they\\'re net ahead, because so manymore new deals appear.One of our axioms at Y Combinator is not to think of deal flow asa zero-sum game.  Our main focus is to encourage more startups to happen,not to win a larger share of the existing stream.  We\\'ve found thisprinciple very useful, and we think as it spreads outward it willhelp later stage investors as well.\"Make something people want\"applies to us too.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': '(I wrote this talk for ahigh school.  I never actually gave it, because the school authorities vetoed the plan to invite me.)When I said I was speaking at a high school, my friends were curious.What will you say to high school students?  So I asked them, whatdo you wish someone had told you in high school?  Their answerswere remarkably similar.  So I\\'m going to tell you what we all wishsomeone had told us.I\\'ll start by telling you something you don\\'t have to know in highschool: what you want to do with your life.  People are alwaysasking you this, so you think you\\'re supposed to have an answer.But adults ask this mainly as a conversation starter.   They wantto know what sort of person you are, and this question is just toget you talking.  They ask it the way you might poke a hermit crabin a tide pool, to see what it does.If I were back in high school and someone asked about my plans, I\\'dsay that my first priority was to learn what the options were.  Youdon\\'t need to be in a rush to choose your life\\'s work.  What you   need to do is discover what you like.  You have to work on stuff  you like if you want to be good at what you do.It might seem that nothing would be easier than deciding what youlike, but it turns out to be hard, partly because it\\'s hard to getan accurate picture of most jobs.  Being a doctor is not the wayit\\'s portrayed on TV.  Fortunately you can also watch real doctors,by volunteering in hospitals. [1]But there are other jobs you can\\'t learn about, because no one isdoing them yet.  Most of the work I\\'ve done in the last ten yearsdidn\\'t exist when I was in high school.  The world changes fast,  and the rate at which it changes is itself speeding up.  In such aworld it\\'s not a good idea to have fixed plans.And yet every May, speakers all over the country fire up the Standard Graduation Speech, the theme of which is: don\\'t give up on yourdreams.  I know what they mean, but this is a bad way to put it,because it implies you\\'re supposed to be bound by some plan youmade early on.  The computer world has a name for this: prematureoptimization.  And it is synonymous with disaster.  These speakerswould do better to say simply, don\\'t give up.What they really mean is, don\\'t get demoralized.  Don\\'t think that   you can\\'t do what other people can.   And I agree you shouldn\\'t  underestimate your potential.  People who\\'ve done great things tendto seem as if they were a race apart.  And most biographies only   exaggerate this illusion, partly due to the worshipful attitude   biographers inevitably sink into, and partly because, knowing howthe story ends, they can\\'t help streamlining the plot till it seemslike the subject\\'s life was a matter of destiny, the mere unfoldingof some innate genius.   In fact I suspect if you had the sixteenyear old Shakespeare or Einstein in school with you, they\\'d seemimpressive, but not totally unlike your other friends.Which is an uncomfortable thought.  If they were just like us, thenthey had to work very hard to do what they did.  And that\\'s one  reason we like to believe in genius.  It gives us an excuse forbeing lazy.  If these guys were able to do what they did only becauseof some magic Shakespeareness or Einsteinness, then it\\'s not ourfault if we can\\'t do something as good.I\\'m not saying there\\'s no such thing as genius.  But if you\\'retrying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse for being lazy, the other one is probably right.So far we\\'ve cut the Standard Graduation Speech down from \"don\\'tgive up on your dreams\" to \"what someone else can do, you can do.\"But it needs to be cut still further.  There issomevariationin natural ability.  Most people overestimate its role, but it does  exist.  If I were talking to a guy four feet tall whose ambition was to play in the NBA, I\\'d feel pretty stupid saying, you cando anything if you really try. [2]We need to cut the Standard Graduation Speech down to, \"what someoneelse with your abilities can do, you can do; and don\\'t underestimateyour abilities.\"  But as so often happens, the closer you get tothe truth, the messier your sentence gets.  We\\'ve taken a nice, neat (but wrong) slogan, and churned it up like a mud puddle.  Itdoesn\\'t make a very good speech anymore.  But worse still, it doesn\\'ttell you what to do anymore.  Someone with your abilities?  What  are your abilities?UpwindI think the solution is to work in the other direction.  Insteadof working back from a goal, work forward from promising situations.This is what most successful people actually do anyway.In the graduation-speech approach, you decide where you want to bein twenty years, and then ask: what should I do now to get there?  I propose instead that you don\\'t commit to anything in the future,but just look at the options available now, and choose those thatwill give you the most promising range of options afterward.It\\'s not so important what you work on, so long as you\\'re not wastingyour time.  Work on things that interest you and increase youroptions, and worry later about which you\\'ll take.Suppose you\\'re a college freshman deciding whether to major in math   or economics.  Well, math will give you more options: you can go intoalmost any field from math.  If you major in math it will be easyto get into grad school in economics, but if you major in economicsit will be hard to get into grad school in math.Flying a glider is a good metaphor here.  Because a glider doesn\\'thave an engine, you can\\'t fly into the wind without losing a lotof altitude.  If you let yourself get far downwind of good places    to land, your options narrow uncomfortably.  As a rule you want tostay upwind.  So I propose that as a replacement for \"don\\'t give   up on your dreams.\"  Stay upwind.How do you do that, though?  Even if math is upwind of economics,how are you supposed to know that as a high school student?Well, you don\\'t, and that\\'s what you need to find out.Look for smart peopleand hard problems.  Smart people tend to clump together, and if youcan find such a clump, it\\'s probably worthwhile to join it.  Butit\\'s not straightforward to find these, because there is a lot of  faking going on.To a newly arrived undergraduate, all university departments lookmuch the same.  The professors all seem forbiddingly intellectualand publish papers unintelligible to outsiders.  But while in somefields the papers are unintelligible because they\\'re full of hardideas, in others they\\'re deliberately written in an obscure way toseem as if they\\'re saying something important.  This may seem a   scandalous proposition, but it has been experimentally verified,in the famousSocial Textaffair.  Suspecting that the paperspublished by literary theorists were often just intellectual-soundingnonsense, a physicist deliberately wrote a paper full ofintellectual-sounding nonsense, and submitted it to a literarytheory journal, which published it.The best protection is always to be working on hard problems.   Writing novels is hard.  Reading novels isn\\'t. Hard means worry: if you\\'re not worrying thatsomething you\\'re making will come out badly, or that you won\\'t be able to understand something you\\'re studying, then it isn\\'t hardenough.  There has to be suspense.Well, this seems a grim view of the world, you may think.  What I\\'mtelling you is that you should worry?  Yes, but it\\'s not as bad asit sounds.  It\\'s exhilarating to overcome worries.  You don\\'t seefaces much happier than people winning gold medals.  And you knowwhy they\\'re so happy?  Relief.I\\'m not saying this is the only way to be happy.  Just that somekinds of worry are not as bad as they sound.AmbitionIn practice, \"stay upwind\" reduces to \"work on hard problems.\"  And  you can start today.  I wish I\\'d grasped that inhigh school.Most people like to be good at what they do.  In the so-called real  world this need is a powerful force.  But high school studentsrarely benefit from it, because they\\'re given a fake thing to do.  When I was in high school, I let myself believe that my job was to be a high school student.  And so I let my need to be good at what I did be satisfied by merely doing well in school.If you\\'d asked me in high school what the difference was betweenhigh school kids and adults, I\\'d have said it was that adults had to earn a living.  Wrong.  It\\'s that adults take responsibility forthemselves.  Making a living is only a small part of it.Far more important is to take intellectual responsibility for oneself.If I had to go through high school again, I\\'d treat it like a dayjob.  I don\\'t mean that I\\'d slack in school.  Working at somethingas a day job doesn\\'t mean doing it badly.  It means not being definedby it.  I mean I wouldn\\'t think of myself as a high school student,just as a musician with a day job as a waiter doesn\\'t think of   himself as a waiter. [3]   And when I wasn\\'t working at my day jobI\\'d start trying to do real work.When I ask people what they regret most about high school, theynearly all say the same thing: that they wasted so much time.  Ifyou\\'re wondering what you\\'re doing now that you\\'ll regret mostlater, that\\'s probably it. [4]Some people say this is inevitable — that high school studentsaren\\'t capable of getting anything done yet.  But I don\\'t thinkthis is true.  And the proof is that you\\'re bored.  You probablyweren\\'t bored when you were eight.  When you\\'re eight it\\'s called\"playing\" instead of \"hanging out,\" but it\\'s the same thing.  Andwhen I was eight, I was rarely bored.  Give me a back yard and afew other kids and I could play all day.The reason this got stale in middle school and high school, I nowrealize, is that I was ready for something else.  Childhood wasgetting old.I\\'m not saying you shouldn\\'t hang out with your friends — that youshould all become humorless little robots who do nothing but work.Hanging out with friends is like chocolate cake.  You enjoy it moreif you eat it occasionally than if you eat nothing but chocolate  cake for every meal.  No matter how much you like chocolate cake,you\\'ll be pretty queasy after the third meal of it.  And that\\'s  what the malaise one feels in high school is: mental queasiness.[5]You may be thinking, we have to do more than get good grades.  Wehave to haveextracurricular activities.But you knowperfectly well how bogus most of these are.  Collecting donationsfor a charity is an admirable thing to do, but it\\'s nothard.It\\'s not getting something done.  What I mean by getting somethingdone is learning how to write well, or how to program computers,or what life was really like in preindustrial societies, or how to   draw the human face from life.  This sort of thing rarely translatesinto a line item on a college application.CorruptionIt\\'s dangerous to design your life around getting into college,  because the people you have to impress to get into college are not a very discerning audience.  At most colleges, it\\'s not the professorswho decide whether you get in, but admissions officers, and theyare nowhere near as smart.  They\\'re the NCOs of the intellectualworld. They can\\'t tell how smart you are.The mere existence of prep schools is proof of that.Few parentswould pay so much for their kids to go to a school that didn\\'t improve their admissions prospects.  Prep schools openly say thisis one of their aims.  But what that means, if you stop to think about it, is that they canhack the admissions process: that they can take the very same kidand make him seem a more appealing candidate than he would if he  went to the local public school. [6]Right now most of you feel your job in life is to be a promisingcollege applicant.  But that means you\\'re designing your life tosatisfy a process so mindless that there\\'s a whole industry devotedto subverting it.  No wonder you become cynical.  The malaise youfeel is the same that a producer of reality TV shows or a tobacco industry executive feels.  And you don\\'t even get paid a lot.So what do you do?  What you should not do is rebel.  That\\'s whatI did, and it was a mistake.  I didn\\'t realize exactly what was   happening to us, but I smelled a major rat.  And so I just gave up.Obviously the world sucked, so why bother?When I discovered that one of our teachers was herself using Cliff\\'s'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Jessica and I have certain words that have special significancewhen we\\'re talking about startups. The highest compliment we canpay to founders is to describe them as \"earnest.\" This is not byitself a guarantee of success. You could be earnest but incapable.But when founders are both formidable (another of our words) andearnest, they\\'re as close to unstoppable as you get.Earnestness sounds like a boring, even Victorian virtue. It seemsa bit of an anachronism that people in Silicon Valley would careabout it. Why does this matter so much?When you call someone earnest, you\\'re making a statement about theirmotives. It means both that they\\'re doing something for the rightreasons, and that they\\'re trying as hard as they can. If we imaginemotives as vectors, it means both the direction and the magnitudeare right. Though these are of course related: when people are doingsomething for the right reasons, they try harder.The reason motives matter so much in Silicon Valley is that so manypeople there have the wrong ones. Starting a successful startupmakes you rich and famous. So a lot of the people trying to startthem are doing it for those reasons. Instead of what? Instead ofinterest in the problem for its own sake. That is the root ofearnestness.It\\'s also the hallmark of a nerd. Indeed, when people describethemselves as \"x nerds,\" what they mean is that they\\'re interestedin x for its own sake, and not because it\\'s cool to be interestedin x, or because of what they can get from it. They\\'re saying theycare so much about x that they\\'re willing to sacrifice seeming coolfor its sake.Agenuine interestin something is a very powerful motivator — forsome people, the most powerful motivator of all.Which is whyit\\'s what Jessica and I look for in founders. But as well as beinga source of strength, it\\'s also a source of vulnerability. Caringconstrains you. The earnest can\\'t easily reply in kind to mockingbanter, or put on a cool facade of nihil admirari. They care toomuch. They are doomed to be the straight man. That\\'s a realdisadvantage in yourteenage years, when mocking banter and nihiladmirari often have the upper hand. But it becomes an advantagelater.It\\'s a commonplace now that the kids who were nerds in high schoolbecome the cool kids\\' bosses later on. But people misunderstand whythis happens. It\\'s not just because the nerds are smarter, but alsobecause they\\'re more earnest. When the problems get harder than thefake ones you\\'re given in high school, caring about them starts tomatter.Does it always matter? Do the earnest always win? Not always. Itprobably doesn\\'t matter much in politics, or in crime, or in certaintypes of business that are similar to crime, like gambling, personalinjury law, patent trolling, and so on. Nor does it matter inacademic fields at the morebogusend of the spectrum. And thoughI don\\'t know enough to say for sure, it may not matter in some kindsof humor: it may be possible to be completely cynical and still bevery funny.Looking at the list of fields I mentioned, there\\'s an obviouspattern. Except possibly for humor, these are all types of work I\\'davoid like the plague. So that could be a useful heuristic fordeciding which fields to work in: how much does earnestness matter?Which can in turn presumably be inferred from the prevalence ofnerds at the top.Along with \"nerd,\" another word that tends to be associated withearnestness is \"naive.\" The earnest often seem naive.  It\\'s notjust that they don\\'t have the motives other people have. They oftendon\\'t fully grasp that such motives exist. Or they may knowintellectually that they do, but because they don\\'t feel them, theyforget about them.It works to be slightly naive not just about motives but also,believe it or not, about the problems you\\'re working on. Naiveoptimism can compensate for the bit rot thatrapid changecausesin established beliefs. You plunge into some problem saying \"Howhard can it be?\", and then after solving it you learn that it wastill recently insoluble.Naivete is an obstacle for anyone who wants to seem sophisticated,and this is one reason would-be intellectuals find it so difficultto understand Silicon Valley. It hasn\\'t been safe for such peopleto use the word \"earnest\" outside scare quotes since Oscar Wildewrote \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" in 1895. And yet when youzoom in on Silicon Valley, right intoJessica Livingston\\'s brain,that\\'s what her x-ray visionis seeking out in founders. Earnestness!Who\\'d have guessed? Reporters literally can\\'t believe it whenfounders making piles of money say that they started their companiesto make the world better. The situation seems made for mockery.How can these founders be so naive as not to realize how implausiblethey sound?Though those asking this question don\\'t realize it, that\\'s not arhetorical question.A lot of founders are faking it, of course, particularly the smallerfry, and the soon to be smaller fry. But not all of them. There area significant number of founders who really are interested in theproblem they\\'re solving mainly for its own sake.Why shouldn\\'t there be? We have no difficulty believing that peoplewould be interested in history or math or even old bus tickets fortheir own sake. Why can\\'t there be people interested in self-drivingcars or social networks for their own sake? When you look at thequestion from this side, it seems obvious there would be. And isn\\'tit likely that having a deep interest in something would be a sourceof great energy and resilience? It is in every other field.The question really is why we have a blind spot about business.And the answer to that is obvious if you know enough history. Formost of history, making large amounts of money has not been veryintellectually interesting. In preindustrial times it was never farfrom robbery, and some areas of business still retain that character,except using lawyers instead of soldiers.But there are other areas of business where the work is genuinelyinteresting. Henry Ford got to spend much of his time working oninteresting technical problems, and for the last several decadesthe trend in that direction has been accelerating. It\\'s much easiernow to make a lot of money by working on something you\\'re interestedin than it was50 years ago. And that, rather than how fast theygrow, may be the most important change that startups represent.Though indeed, the fact that the work is genuinely interesting isa big part of why it gets done so fast.Can you imagine a more important change than one in the relationshipbetween intellectual curiosity and money? These are two of the mostpowerful forces in the world, and in my lifetime they\\'ve becomesignificantly more aligned.

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.May 2004(This essay was originally published inHackers & Painters.)If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your bestbet would be to start or join a startup.  That\\'s been a reliable way to get rich for hundreds of years.  The word \"startup\" dates from the 1960s, but what happens in one is very similar to the venture-backed trading voyages of theMiddle Ages.Startups usually involve technology, so much so that the phrase\"high-tech startup\" is almost redundant.  A startup is a smallcompany that takes on a hard technical problem.Lots of people get rich knowing nothing more than that.You don\\'t have to know physics to be a good pitcher.  ButI think it could give you an edge to understand the underlying principles.Why do startups have to be small?  Will a startup inevitably stop being a startup as itgrows larger?  And why do they so often work ondeveloping new technology?   Why are there so many startupsselling new drugs or computer software, and none selling corn oilor laundry detergent?The PropositionEconomically, you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole working life into a few years.  Insteadof working at a low intensity for forty years, you work ashard as you possibly can for four.  This pays especially wellin technology, where you earn a premium for working fast.Here is a brief sketch of the economic proposition.  If you\\'rea good hacker in your mid twenties, you canget a job paying about $80,000 per year.  So on average such a hacker must beable to do at least $80,000 worth of work per year for the company just to break even.  You could probablywork twice as many hours as a corporate employee, and ifyou focus you can probably get three times as much done inan hour.You should get another multiple of two, atleast, by eliminating the drag of the pointy-haired middlemanager who would be your boss in a big company.Then there is one more multiple: how much smarter are youthan your job description expects you to be?Suppose another multiple of three.  Combine all these multipliers, and I\\'mclaiming you could be 36 times more productive than you\\'re expected to be in a random corporatejob.If a fairly good hacker is worth $80,000 a year at a big company, then a smarthacker working very hard without any corporatebullshit to slow him down should be able to do work worth about$3 million a year.Like all back-of-the-envelope calculations, this onehas a lot of wiggle room.  I wouldn\\'t try todefend the actual numbers.  But I stand by the structure of the calculation.  I\\'m not claimingthe multiplier is precisely 36, but it is certainly morethan 10, and probably rarely as high as 100.If $3 million a year seemshigh, remember that we\\'re talking about the limit case:the case where you not only have zero leisure timebut indeed work so hard that you endanger your health.Startups are not magic.  They don\\'t change the laws ofwealth creation.  They just represent a point at the far end of the curve.There is a conservation law at work here: ifyou want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars\\' worth of pain.  For example, one way tomake a million dollars would be to work for the Post Office your whole life, and save every penny of your salary.  Imagine the stress of working for the Post Office for fifty years.   In a startup you compress allthis stress into three or four years.  You do tend to get a certain bulk discount if you buy the economy-size pain,but you can\\'t evade the fundamental conservation law.If starting a startup were easy, everyone would do it.Millions, not BillionsIf $3 million a year seems high to some people, it will seemlow to others.  Threemillion?How do I get to be a billionaire, like Bill Gates?So let\\'s get Bill Gates out of the way right now.  It\\'s nota good idea to use famous rich people as examples, because the press only write about the very richest, and these tend to be outliers.Bill Gates is a smart, determined, and hardworking man,but you need more thanthat to make as much money as he has.  You also need to bevery lucky.There is a large randomfactor in the success of any company.  So the guys you end up reading about in the papers are the ones who are very smart, totally dedicated,andwin the lottery.Certainly Bill is smart and dedicated, but Microsoft also happens to have been the beneficiary of one of the most spectacularblunders in the history of business: the licensing deal forDOS.  No doubt Bill did everything he could to steer IBM into making that blunder, and he has done an excellent job of exploiting it, but ifthere had been one person with a brain on IBM\\'s side,Microsoft\\'s future would have been very different.Microsoft at that stage had little leverage over IBM.They were effectively a component supplier.  If IBM had required an exclusive license, as they should have, Microsoftwould still have signed the deal.  It would still havemeant a lot of money for them,  and IBMcould easily have gotten an operating system elsewhere.Instead IBM ended up using all its power in the marketto give Microsoft control of the PC standard.  From that point, all Microsoft had to do was execute.  Theynever had to bet the company on a bold decision.  All theyhad to do was play hardball with licensees and copy moreinnovative products reasonably promptly.If IBM hadn\\'t made this mistake, Microsoft wouldstill have been a successful company, but itcould not have grown so big so fast. Bill Gates would be rich, but he\\'d be somewherenear the bottom of the Forbes 400 with the other guys his age.There are a lot of ways to getrich, and this essay is about only one of them.  Thisessay is about how to make money by creating wealth andgetting paid for it.  There are plenty of other ways to get money, including chance, speculation, marriage, inheritance, theft, extortion, fraud, monopoly,graft, lobbying,counterfeiting, and prospecting.  Most of the greatest fortuneshave probably involved several of these.The advantage of creating wealth, as a way to get rich,is not just that it\\'s more legitimate (many of the other methods are now illegal) but that it\\'s morestraightforward.You just have to do something people want.Money Is Not WealthIf you want to create wealth, it will help to understand what it is.  Wealth is not the same thing as money.Wealth is as old ashuman history.  Far older, in fact; ants have wealth. Money is a comparatively recent invention.Wealth is the fundamental thing.  Wealth is stuff we want: food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places,and so on.  You can have wealth withouthaving money.  If you had a magic machine thatcould on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do yourlaundry, or do anything else you wanted, you wouldn\\'t need money.Whereas if you were in the middle of Antarctica, where there isnothing to buy, it wouldn\\'t matter how much money you had.Wealth is what you want, not money.  But if wealth is the importantthing, why does everyone talk about making money?   It isa kind of shorthand: money is a way of moving wealth, and in practicethey are usually interchangeable.  But they are not the same thing,and unless you plan to get rich by counterfeiting, talking aboutmaking moneycan make it harder to understand how to make money.Money is a side effect of specialization.In a specialized society, most of thethings you need, you can\\'t make for yourself.  If you want a potatoor a pencil or a place to live, you have to get it from someoneelse.How do you get the person who grows the potatoes to give you some?By giving him something he wants in return.  But you can\\'t getvery far by trading things directly with the people whoneed them.  If you make violins, and none of the localfarmers wants one, how will you eat?The solution societies find, as they get more specialized, is tomake the trade into a two-step process.  Instead of trading violinsdirectly for potatoes, you trade violins for, say, silver, which you can then trade again for anything else you need.  Theintermediate stuff-- themedium of exchange-- can be anything that\\'srare and portable.  Historically metals have been the most common,but recently we\\'ve been using a medium of exchange, called thedollar,that doesn\\'t physically exist.  It works as a medium of exchange,however, because its rarity is guaranteed by the U.S. Government.The advantage of a medium of exchange is that it makes trade work.The disadvantage is that it tends to obscure what trade reallymeans.  People think that what a business does is make money.But money is just the intermediate stage-- justa shorthand-- for whatever people want.What most businesses really do is make  wealth.  They do something people want.The Pie FallacyA surprising number of people retain from childhood the ideathat there is a fixed amount of wealth in the world. There is, in any normal family, a fixed amount ofmoneyat any moment.  But that\\'s not the same thing.When wealth is talked about in this context, it is oftendescribed as a pie.  \"You can\\'t make the pie larger,\"say politicians.When you\\'retalking about the amount of money in one family\\'s bankaccount, or the amount available to a government from oneyear\\'s tax revenue, this is true.  If one person gets more, someone else has to get less.I can remember believing, as a child, that if a fewrich people had all the money, it left less for everyone else.Many people seem to continue to believe something like thiswell into adulthood.  This fallacy is usually there in the background when you hear someone talking about how x percentof the population have y percent of the wealth.  If you planto start a startup, then whether you realize it or not, you\\'replanning to disprove the Pie Fallacy.What leads people astray here is the abstraction ofmoney.  Money is not wealth.  It\\'sjust something we use to move wealth around.So although there may be, in certain specific moments (likeyour family, this month) a fixed amount of money available totrade with other people for things you want,there is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world.You can make more wealth.Wealth has been getting created anddestroyed (but on balance, created) for all of human history.Suppose you own a beat-up old car. Instead of sitting on your butt nextsummer, you could spend the time restoring your car to pristine condition.In doing so you create wealth.  The world is-- andyou specifically are-- one pristine old car the richer.  And notjust in some metaphorical way.  If you sell your car,you\\'ll get more for it.In restoring your old car you have made yourselfricher.  You haven\\'t made anyone else poorer.  So there isobviously not a fixed pie.  And in fact, when you look at it this way, you wonder why anyone would think there was.Kids know, without knowing they know, that they can createwealth.  If you need to give someone a present and don\\'thave any money, you make one.  But kids are so bad at makingthings that they consider home-made presents to be a distinct,inferior, sort of thing to store-bought ones-- a mere expressionof the proverbial thought that counts. And indeed, the lumpy ashtrayswe made for our parents did not have much of a resale market.CraftsmenThe people most likely to grasp that wealth can becreated are the ones who are good at making things, the craftsmen.Their hand-made objects become store-bought ones. But with the rise of industrialization there are fewer andfewer craftsmen.  One of the biggest remaining groups  iscomputer programmers.A programmer can sit down in front of a computer andcreate wealth.  A good piece of software is, in itself, a valuable thing.There is no manufacturing to confuse the issue.  Thosecharacters you type are a complete, finished product.If someone sat down and wrote a webbrowser that didn\\'t suck (a fine idea, by the way), the worldwould be that much richer.[5b]Everyone in a company works together to createwealth, in the sense of making more things people want.Many of the employees (e.g. the people in the mailroom orthe personnel department) work at one remove from the actual making of stuff.  Not the programmers.  Theyliterally think the product, one line at a time.And so it\\'s clearer to programmers that wealth is somethingthat\\'s made, rather than being distributed, like slices of apie, by some imaginary Daddy.It\\'s also obvious to programmers that there are huge variationsin the rate at which wealth is created.  At Viaweb we had oneprogrammer who was a sort of monster of productivity.  I remember watching what he did one long day and estimating thathe had added several hundred thousand dollarsto the market value of the company. A great programmer, on a roll, could create a million dollars worth of wealth in a couple weeks.A mediocre programmer over the same period will generate zero oreven negative wealth (e.g. by introducing bugs).This iswhy so many of the best programmers are libertarians.In our world, you sink or swim, and there are no excuses.When those far removed from the creation of wealth-- undergraduates,reporters, politicians-- hearthat the richest 5% of the people have half the total wealth, they tend to thinkinjustice!An experienced programmer would be more likely to thinkis that all?The top 5% of programmersprobably write 99% of the good software.Wealth can be created without being sold.  Scientists, tillrecently at least, effectively donated the wealth they created.  We are all richer for knowing about penicillin,because we\\'re less likely to die from infections.  Wealthis whatever people want, and not dying is certainly somethingwe want.  Hackers often donate their work by writing open source software that anyone can use for free.I am much the richer for the operating systemFreeBSD, which I\\'m running on the computer I\\'m using now,and so is Yahoo, which runs it on all their servers.What a Job IsIn industrialized countries, people belong to one institution oranother at least until their twenties.  After all those years you getused to the idea of belonging to a group of people who all get upin the morning, go to some set of buildings, and do things that theydo not, ordinarily, enjoy doing.  Belonging to such a group becomespart of your identity: name, age, role, institution.If you have to introduce yourself, orsomeone else describes you, it will be as something like, JohnSmith, age 10, a student at such and such elementary school, orJohn Smith, age 20, a student at such and such college.When John Smith finishes school he is expected to get a job.  Andwhat getting a job seems to mean is joining another institution.Superficially it\\'s a lot like college.  You pick the companies youwant to work for and apply to join them.  If one likes you, youbecome a member of this new group.  You get up in the morning andgo to a new set of buildings, and do things that you do not, ordinarily,enjoy doing.  There are a few differences: life is not as much fun,and you get paid, instead of paying, as you did in college.  Butthe similarities feel greater than the differences.  John Smith isnow John Smith, 22, a software developer at such and such corporation.In fact John Smith\\'slife has changed more than he realizes.  Socially, a companylooks much like college, but the deeper you go into theunderlying reality, the more different it gets.What a company does, and has to do if it wants to continue toexist, is earn money.  And the way most companies make moneyis by creating wealth.  Companies can be so specialized that thissimilarity is concealed, but it is not only manufacturing companies that create wealth.  A big component of wealth islocation. Remember that magic machine that couldmake you cars and cook you dinner and so on?  It would not beso useful if it delivered your dinner to a random locationin central Asia.  If wealth means what people want, companies that movethings also create wealth.  Ditto formany other kinds of companies that don\\'t make anythingphysical.  Nearly all companies exist to do something peoplewant.And that\\'s what you do, as well, when you go to work for a company.But here there is another layer that tends to obscure the underlyingreality.  In a company, the work you do is averaged together witha lot of other people\\'s.  You may not even be aware you\\'re doing something peoplewant.  Your contribution may be indirect.  But the company as awhole must be giving people something they want, or they won\\'t makeany money.  And if they are paying you x dollars a year, then onaverage you must be contributing at least x dollars a year worthof work, or the company will be spending more than it makes,and will go out of business.Someone graduating from college thinks, and is told, that he needsto get a job, as if the important thing were becoming a member of an institution.  A more direct way to put it would be: you need tostart doing something people want.  You don\\'tneed tojoin a company to do that.  All a company is is a group of peopleworking together to do something people want.  It\\'s doing something peoplewant that matters, not joining the group.For most people the   best plan probably is to go to work for some existingcompany.  But it is a good idea to understand what\\'s happening   when you do this.  A job means doing something people want,averaged together with everyone else in that company.Working HarderThat averaging gets to be a problem.I think the single biggest problem afflicting large companies is the   difficulty of assigning a value to each person\\'s work. For the most part they punt.  In abig company you get paid a fairly predictable salary for working fairly hard.  You\\'re expected not to be obviously incompetent orlazy, but you\\'re not expected to devote your whole life to yourwork.It turns out, though, that there are economies of scale in how much of yourlife you devote to your work.  In the right kind of business,  someone who really devoted himself to work could generate ten oreven a hundred times as much wealth as an averageemployee.  A programmer, for example, instead of chugging alongmaintaining and updating an existing piece of software, could writea whole new piece of software, and with it create a new source ofrevenue.Companies are not set up to reward people who want to do this. You can\\'t go to your boss and say, I\\'d like to start working tentimes as hard, so will you please pay me ten times as much? Forone thing, the official fiction is that you are already working ashard as you can.  But a more serious problem is that the companyhas no way of measuring the value of your work.Salesmen are an exception.  It\\'s easy to measure how much revenue they generate, and they\\'reusually paid a percentage of it.  If a salesman wants to work harder,he can just start doing it, and he will automaticallyget paid proportionally more.There is one other job besides sales where big companies canhire first-rate people: in the top management jobs. And for the same reason: their performance canbe measured.  The top managers areheld responsible for the performance of the entire company.Because an ordinary employee\\'s performance can\\'t usuallybe measured, he is not expected to domore than put in a solid effort.  Whereas top management, likesalespeople, have to actually come up with the numbers.The CEO of a company that tanks cannot plead that he put in  a solid effort.  If the company does badly, he\\'s done badly.A company that could pay all its employees so straightforwardly   would be enormously successful.  Many employees would work harderif they could get paid for it.  More importantly,such a company would attract people who wanted to workespecially hard. It would crush its competitors.Unfortunately, companies can\\'t pay everyone like salesmen.  Salesmenwork alone.  Most employees\\' work is tangled together.  Supposea company makes some kind of consumer gadget.  The engineers build a reliable gadget with all kinds of new features;the industrial designers design a beautiful case for it; and thenthe marketing people convince everyone thatit\\'s something they\\'ve got to have.  How do you know how much of thegadget\\'s sales are due to each group\\'s efforts?  Or, for thatmatter, how much is due to the creators of past gadgets that gavethe company a reputation for quality?  There\\'s no way to  untangle all their contributions.  Even if you could read the mindsof the consumers, you\\'d find these factors were all blurred together.If you want to go faster, it\\'s a problem to have your worktangled together with a large number of other people\\'s.  In a  large group, your performance is not separately measurable-- and the rest of the group slows you down.Measurement and LeverageTo get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with twothings, measurement and leverage.  You need to be in aposition where your performance can be measured, or there isno way to get paid more by doing more.  And you have tohave leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have   a big effect.Measurement alone is not enough.  An example of a job withmeasurement but not leverage is doing piecework in asweatshop.  Your performance is measured and you get paid  accordingly, but you have no scope for decisions.  The onlydecision you get to make is how fast you work, and thatcan probably only increase your earnings by a factorof two or three.An example of a job with both measurement and leverage wouldbe lead actor in a movie.  Your performance can be measured in thegross of the movie.  And you have leverage in the sense that yourperformance can make or break it.CEOs also have both measurement and leverage.  They\\'re measured,in that the performance of the company is their performance.And they have leverage in that their decisionsset the whole company moving in one direction or another.I think everyone who gets rich by their own efforts will befound to be in a situation with measurement and leverage.    Everyone I can think of does: CEOs, movie stars, hedge fund managers, professional athletes.  A good hint to thepresence of leverage is the possibility of failure.Upside must be balanced by downside, so if there is big potential for gain there must also be a terrifyingpossibility of loss.  CEOs, stars, fund managers, and athletesall live with the sword hanging over their heads;the moment they start to suck, they\\'re out.  If you\\'re ina job that feels safe, you are not going to get rich,because if there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage.But you don\\'t have to become a CEO or a movie star tobe in a situation with measurement and leverage.  All you        need to do is be part of a small group working on ahard problem.Smallness = MeasurementIf you can\\'t measure the value of the work done by individual  employees, you can get close.  You can measure the valueof the work done by small groups.One level at which you can accurately measure the revenuegenerated by employees is at the level of the whole company.   When the company is small, you are thereby fairly close to measuring the contributions of individual employees.  A viablestartup might only have ten employees, which puts you within afactor of ten of measuring individual effort.Starting or joining a startup is thus as close as mostpeople can get to saying to one\\'s boss, I want to work ten timesas hard, so please pay me ten times as much.  There are twodifferences: you\\'re not saying it to your boss, but directly to thecustomers (for whom your boss is only a proxy after all), andyou\\'re not doing it individually, but along with a small groupof other ambitious people.It will, ordinarily, be a group.  Except in a few unusual kindsof work, like acting or writing books, you can\\'t be a company of one person.  And the people you work with had better be good, because it\\'s their work thatyours is going to be averaged with.A big company is like a giant galley driven by a thousand rowers.Two things keep the speed of thegalley down.  One is that individual rowers don\\'t see anyresult from working harder. The other is that, in a group of athousand people, the average rower is likely  to bepretty average.If you took ten people at random out of the big galley andput them in a boat by themselves, they could probably go  faster.  They would have both carrot and stick to motivate   them.  An energetic rower would be encouraged by the thoughtthat he could have a visible effect on the speed ofthe boat.  And if someone was lazy, the others would be more likelyto notice and complain.But the real advantage of the ten-man boat shows when you take the tenbestrowers out of the big galleyand put them in a boat together.  They will have allthe extra motivation that comes from being in a small group.But more importantly, by selecting that small a groupyou can get the best rowers.  Each one will be inthe top 1%.  It\\'s a much better deal for them to average  their work together with a small group of their peers than to    average it with everyone.That\\'s the real point of startups.  Ideally, you are gettingtogether with a group of other people who also want to worka lot harder, and get paid a lot more, than they would ina big company.  And because startups tend to get founded by self-selecting groups of ambitious people who already know one another (at least by reputation), the level of measurement is more precise than you get from smallness alone.A startup is not merely ten people, but ten people like you.Steve Jobs once said that the success or failure of a startupdepends on the first ten employees.  I agree. If anything, it\\'s more like the first five.Being small is not, in itself, what makes startups kick butt,   but rather that small groups can be select.You don\\'t want small in the sense of avillage, but small in the sense of an all-star team.The larger a group, the closer its average member will be to the averagefor the population as a whole.   So all other things beingequal, a very able person in a big company is probablygetting a bad deal, because his performance is dragged down bythe overall lower performance of the others.  Of course,all other things often are not equal: the able person may not care about money, or may prefer the stability of a largecompany.  But a very able person who does care about moneywill ordinarily do better to go off and work with a smallgroup of peers.Technology = LeverageStartups offer anyone a way to be in a situation withmeasurement and leverage.They allow measurement because they\\'re small,and they offer leverage because theymake money by inventing new technology.What is technology?  It\\'stechnique. It\\'s the way  we all do things.  And whenyou discover a new way to do things, its value is multipliedby all the people who use it.  It is the proverbial fishingrod, rather than the fish.  That\\'s the difference between astartup and a restaurant or a barber shop.  You fry eggs or cut hair one customer at a time.  Whereas if you solve a technical problem that a lot of people care about,you help everyone who uses your solution.  That\\'s leverage.If you look at history, it seems that most peoplewho got rich by creating wealth did it by developingnew technology.  You just can\\'t fry eggs or cut hair fast enough.What made the Florentines rich in 1200 was the discovery of new techniques for making the high-tech product of the time, fine woven cloth.  What made theDutch rich in 1600 was the discovery of shipbuilding andnavigation techniques that enabled them to dominate the seasof the Far East.Fortunately there is a natural fit between smallness andsolving hard problems.  The leading edge of technology movesfast.  Technology that\\'s valuable today could be worthlessin a couple years.  Small companies are more at home in thisworld, because they don\\'t have layers of bureaucracy toslow them down.Also, technical advances tend to come from unorthodox approaches,and small companies are less constrained by convention.Big companies can develop technology.  They just can\\'t do itquickly.  Their size makes them slow and preventsthem from rewarding employees for the extraordinaryeffort required.  So in practice big companies only get to develop technology in fields where large capital requirements prevent startups fromcompeting with them, like microprocessors, power plants, or passenger aircraft.  And even in those fields they depend heavilyon startups for components and ideas.It\\'s obvious that biotech or software startups exist to solvehard technical problems, but I think it will also be found to be true in businesses that don\\'t seem to be about technology.  McDonald\\'s,for example, grew big by designing a system, the McDonald\\'s franchise, that could then be reproduced at will all over the face of the earth.  A McDonald\\'s franchise is controlled by rulesso precise that it is practicallya piece of software.  Write once, run everywhere.Ditto for Wal-Mart.  Sam Walton got rich not by being a retailer, but by designing a new kind of store.Use difficulty as a guide not just in selecting the overallaim of your company, but also at decision points along the way.At Viaweb one of our rules of thumb wasrun upstairs.Suppose you are a little, nimble guy being chased by a big,fat, bully.  You open a door and find yourself in a    staircase.  Do you go up or down?  I say up.  Thebully can probably run downstairs as fast as you can.Going upstairs his bulk will be more of a disadvantage.Running upstairs is hard for you but even harder for him.What this meant in practice was that we deliberately sought      hard problems.  If there were two features we could add to oursoftware, both equally valuable in proportion to their difficulty,we\\'d always take the harder one.  Not just because it was more valuable, butbecause it was harder.We delighted in forcing bigger, slower competitorsto follow us over difficult ground.Like guerillas, startups prefer the difficult terrain of themountains, where the troops of the central governmentcan\\'t follow.  I can remember times when we were justexhausted after wrestling all day with some horrible technicalproblem.  And I\\'d be delighted, because something that was hard for us would be impossible for our competitors.This is not just a good way to run a startup.  It\\'s whata startup is.Venture capitalists know about this and have a phrase for it:barriers to entry.If you go to a VC with a new idea and ask him to invest in it, one of the first thingshe\\'ll ask is, how hard would this be for someone else to  develop?  That is, how much difficult groundhave you put between yourself and potential pursuers?And you had better have a convincing explanation of why your technology would be hard to duplicate.  Otherwise assoon as some big company becomes aware of it, they\\'ll maketheir own, and with their brand name, capital, anddistribution clout, they\\'ll take away your market overnight.You\\'d be like guerillas caught in the open field by regulararmy forces.One way to put up barriers to entry is through patents. But patents may not provide much protection. Competitors commonly find ways to work around a patent.And if they can\\'t, they may simply violate it and invite you to sue them.A big company is not afraid to be sued; it\\'s an everyday thingfor them.  They\\'ll make sure that suing them is expensive andtakes a long time.Ever heard of Philo Farnsworth?  He inventedtelevision.  The reason you\\'ve neverheard of him is that his company was not the one to makemoney from it.The company that did was RCA, andFarnsworth\\'s reward for his efforts was a decade ofpatent litigation.Here, as so often, the best defense is a good offense.  Ifyou can develop technology that\\'s simply too hard forcompetitors to duplicate, you don\\'t need to rely on otherdefenses.  Start by picking a hard problem, andthen at every decision point, take the harder choice.The Catch(es)If it were simply a matter of working harder than an ordinary employee and getting paid proportionately, it wouldobviously be a good deal to start a startup.  Up to a point itwould be more fun. I don\\'t think many people like the slow pace of big companies, the interminable meetings,the water-cooler conversations, the clueless middle managers,and so on.Unfortunately there are a couple catches.  One is that youcan\\'t choose the point on the curve that you want to inhabit.You can\\'t decide, for example, that you\\'d like to work justtwo or three times as hard, and get paid that much more.  Whenyou\\'re running a startup, your competitors decide howhard you work.  And they pretty much all make the same decision:as hard as you possibly can.The other catch is that the payoff is only on average proportionateto your productivity.  There is, as I said before, a largerandom multiplier in the success of any company.  So inpractice the deal is not that you\\'re 30 times as productive and get paid 30 times as much.  It is that you\\'re 30 times as productive,and get paid between zero and a thousand times as much.If the mean is 30x, the median is probably zero.Most startups tank, and not just the dogfood portals we all heard about duringthe Internet Bubble.  It\\'s common for a startupto be developing a genuinely good product, take slightlytoo long to do it, run out of money, and have to shut down.A startup is like a mosquito.  A bear can absorb a hit and a crabis armored against one, but a mosquito is designed for one thing:to score.  No energy is wasted on defense.  The defense of mosquitos, as a species, is that there are a lot of them, but this is little consolation to the individual mosquito.Startups, like mosquitos, tend to be an all-or-nothing proposition.And you don\\'t generally know which of the two you\\'re going toget till the last minute. Viaweb came close to tanking several times. Our trajectorywas like a sine wave.  Fortunately we got bought atthe top of the cycle, but it was damned close.   While we werevisiting Yahoo in California to talk about selling the companyto them, we had to borrow a conference room to reassurean investor who was about to back out of a new round of funding that we needed to stay alive.The all-or-nothing aspect of startups was not something we wanted.Viaweb\\'s hackers were all extremely risk-averse.If there had been some way just to work super hard and getpaid for it, without having a lottery mixed in, we would havebeen delighted.  We would have much preferred a 100% chance of$1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, even though theoretically the second is worth twice as much.   Unfortunately,there is not currently any space in the business world whereyou can get the first deal.The closest you can get is byselling your startup in the early stages, giving up upside  (and risk) for a smaller but guaranteed payoff.  We had a chance to do this, and stupidly, as we then thought, let it slip by.After that we became comically eager to sell.For the next year or so,if anyone expressed the slightest curiosity about Viawebwe would try to sell them the company.  But there were no takers,so we had to keep going.It would have been a bargain to buy us at an early stage, but companies doing acquisitions are notlooking for bargains.  A company big enough to acquire startups will be big enough to be fairly conservative, and within the company the people in charge of acquisitions willbe among the more conservative, because they are likely to bebusiness school types who joined the company late.  They would rather overpay for a safe choice.  Soit is easier to sell an established startup, even at a largepremium, than an early-stage one.Get UsersI think it\\'s a good idea to get bought, if you can.  Running abusiness is different from growing one.It is just as well to let a big company take over once you reach cruising altitude.  It\\'salso financially wiser, because selling allows you to diversify.What would you think of a financial advisor who put all hisclient\\'s assets into one volatile stock?How do you get bought?  Mostly by doing the same things you\\'d do if you didn\\'t intend to sell the company.  Being profitable, for example.   But getting bought is also an artin its own right, and one that we spent a lot of time tryingto master.Potential buyers willalways delay if they can.  The hard part about gettingbought is getting them to act.  For most people, the most powerful motivatoris not the hope of gain, but the fear of loss.  For potentialacquirers, the most powerful motivator is the prospect that one of their competitors will buy you.  This, as we found, causes CEOs to take red-eyes.  The second biggest is the worry that, if they don\\'t buy you now, you\\'ll continue to grow rapidly and will cost more toacquire later, or even become a competitor.In both cases, what it all comes down to is users.  You\\'d think that a company about to buy you would do a lot ofresearch and decide for themselves how valuable your technologywas.  Not at all.  What they go by is the number of users youhave.In effect, acquirers assume the customers know who has thebest technology.  And this is not as stupid as it sounds.  Users are the only real proof that you\\'ve created wealth.  Wealth is what people want, and if people aren\\'t using your software,maybe it\\'s not just because you\\'re bad at marketing.  Maybe it\\'sbecause you haven\\'t made what they want.Venture capitalists have a list of danger signs to watch out for.Near the top is the company run by techno-weenies who are obsessed with solving interesting technical problems, insteadof making users happy.  In a startup, you\\'re not just trying tosolve problems.  You\\'re trying to solve problemsthat users care about.So I think you should make users the test, just as acquirers do.  Treat a startup as an optimization problem in which performance is measured by number of users.  As anyonewho has tried to optimize software knows, the key is measurement.When you try to guess where your program is slow, and what wouldmake it faster, you almost always guess wrong.Number of users may not be the perfect test, but it will be very close.  It\\'s what acquirers care about.  It\\'s what revenues depend on.  It\\'s what makes competitors unhappy.It\\'s what impresses reporters, and potentialnew users.  Certainly it\\'s a better test than your a priorinotions of what problems are important to solve, no matter howtechnically adept you are.Among other things, treating a startup as an optimizationproblem will help you avoid anotherpitfall that VCs worry about, and rightly-- taking a long timeto develop a product.  Now we can recognize this as somethinghackers already know to avoid: premature optimization.  Get a version 1.0 out there as soon as you can.  Until you have some users tomeasure, you\\'re optimizing based on guesses.The ball you need to keep your eye on here is the underlyingprinciple that wealth is what people want.  If you plan to get rich by creating wealth, you have to know what people want.  So few businesses really pay attention to making customers happy.How often do you walk into a store, or call a company on thephone, with a feeling of dread in the back of your mind?When you hear \"your call is important to us, please stay onthe line,\" do you think, oh good, now everything will be all right?A restaurant can afford to serve the occasional burnt dinner.But in technology, you cook one thing and that\\'s what everyoneeats.  So any difference between what people want and whatyou deliver is multiplied.  You please or annoycustomers wholesale.  The closer you can get to what they want,the more wealth you generate.Wealth and PowerMaking wealth is not the only way to get rich.  For most ofhuman history it has not even been the most common.  Untila few centuries ago,the main sources of wealth were mines, slaves and serfs,land, and cattle,and the only ways to acquire these rapidly were by inheritance,marriage, conquest, or confiscation.  Naturally wealth had a bad reputation.Two things changed.  The first was the rule of law.  For most of the world\\'shistory, if you did somehow accumulate a fortune, the ruler or his henchmen would find a way to steal it.But in medieval Europe something new happened.A new class of merchants and manufacturersbegan to collect in towns.Together they were able to withstand the local feudallord.  So for the first time in our history, the bullies stopped stealing thenerds\\' lunch money.This was naturally a great incentive,and possibly indeed the main cause of the second big change,industrialization.A great deal has been written about the causes of the Industrial Revolution.  But surely a necessary, if not sufficient, conditionwas that people who made fortunes be able to enjoy them in peace.One piece of evidence is what happened to countriesthat tried to return to the old model, like the SovietUnion, and to a lesser extent Britain under the laborgovernments of the 1960s and early 1970s.  Take away the incentiveof wealth, and technical innovation grinds to a halt.Remember what a startup is, economically: a way of saying, I want to work faster.  Instead of accumulatingmoney slowly by being paid a regular wage for fifty years, I want to get it over with as soon as possible.  So governmentsthat forbid you to accumulate wealth are in effect decreeingthat you work slowly.  They\\'re willing to let you earn $3 million overfifty years, but they\\'re not willing to let you work so hard thatyou can do it in two.  They are likethe corporate boss that you can\\'t go to and say, I want to workten times as hard, so please pay me ten times a much.Except this is not a boss you can escape by starting your owncompany.The problem with working slowly is not just that technicalinnovation happens slowly.  It\\'s that it tends not to happen at all.It\\'s only when you\\'re deliberately looking for hard problems,as a way to use speed to the greatest advantage, that you takeon this kind of project.  Developing new technology is a pain in the ass. It is, as Edison said, one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.  Without the incentive of wealth, no one wants to do it.Engineers will work on sexy projects like fighter planes and moonrockets for ordinary salaries, but more mundane technologieslike light bulbs or semiconductors have to be developed by entrepreneurs.Startupsare not just something that happened in Silicon Valley in the last couple decades.  Since it became possible toget rich by creating wealth, everyone who has done it hasused essentially the same recipe: measurement and leverage,where measurement comes from working with a smallgroup, and leverage from developing new techniques.The recipe was the same in Florence in 1200 as it is in Santa Clara today.Understanding this may help to answer an important question:why Europe grew so powerful.Was it something about the geography of Europe?  Was it that Europeans are somehow racially superior?Was it their religion?  The answer (or at leastthe proximate cause) may be that theEuropeans rode on the crest of a powerful new idea: allowing those whomade a lot of money to keep it.Once you\\'re allowed to do that, people who want to get rich can do it by generatingwealth instead of stealing it.The resulting technological growth translates not only into wealth but into military power.  The theory that led tothe stealth plane was developed by a Soviet mathematician.But because the Soviet Union didn\\'t have a computer industry,it remained for them a theory;they didn\\'t have hardware capable of executing the calculationsfast enough to design an actual airplane.In that respect the Cold War teaches the same lesson asWorld War II and, for that matter, most wars in recent history.Don\\'t let a rulingclass of warriors and politicians squash the entrepreneurs.The same recipe that makes individuals richmakes countries powerful.  Let the nerds keep their lunchmoney, and you rule the world.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': '(This article is derived from a keynote talk at the fall 2002 meetingof NEPLS.)Visitors to this country are often surprised to find thatAmericans like to begin a conversation by asking \"what do you do?\"I\\'ve never liked this question.  I\\'ve rarely had aneat answer to it.  But I think I have finally solved the problem.Now, when someone asks me what I do, I look them straightin the eye and say \"I\\'m designing anew dialect of Lisp.\"   I recommend this answer to anyone who doesn\\'t like being asked whatthey do.  The conversation will turn immediately to other topics.I don\\'t consider myself to be doing research on programming languages.I\\'m just designing one, in the same way that someone might designa building or a chair or a new typeface.I\\'m not trying to discover anything new.  I just wantto make a language that will be good to program in.  In some ways,this assumption makes life a lot easier.The difference between design and research seems to be a questionof new versus good.  Design doesn\\'t have to be new, but it has to  be good.  Research doesn\\'t have to be good, but it has to be new.I think these two paths converge at the top: the best designsurpasses its predecessors by using new ideas, and the best researchsolves problems that are not only new, but actually worth solving.So ultimately we\\'re aiming for the same destination, just approachingit from different directions.What I\\'m going to talk about today is what your target looks likefrom the back.  What do you do differently when you treatprogramming languages as a design problem instead of a research topic?The biggest difference is that you focus more on the user.Design begins by asking, who is thisfor and what do they need from it?  A good architect,for example, does not begin by creating a design that he thenimposes on the users, but by studying the intended users and figuringout what they need.Notice I said \"what they need,\" not \"what they want.\"  I don\\'t meanto give the impression that working as a designer means working as a sort of short-order cook, making whatever the client tells youto.  This varies from field to field in the arts, butI don\\'t think there is any field in which the best work is done bythe people who just make exactly what the customers tell them to.The customerisalways right inthe sense that the measure of good design is how well it worksfor the user.  If you make a novel that bores everyone, or a chairthat\\'s horribly uncomfortable to sit in, then you\\'ve done a badjob, period.  It\\'s no defense to say that the novel or the chair  is designed according to the most advanced theoretical principles.And yet, making what works for the user doesn\\'t mean simply makingwhat the user tells you to.  Users don\\'t know what all the choicesare, and are often mistaken about what they really want.The answer to the paradox, I think, is that you have to designfor the user, but you have to design what the user needs, not simply  what he says he wants.It\\'s much like being a doctor.  You can\\'t just treat a patient\\'ssymptoms.  When a patient tells you his symptoms, you have to figureout what\\'s actually wrong with him, and treat that.This focus on the user is a kind of axiom from which most of thepractice of good design can be derived, and around which most designissues center.If good design must do what the user needs, who is the user?  WhenI say that design must be for users, I don\\'t mean to imply that good design aims at some kind of  lowest common denominator.  You can pick any group of users youwant.  If you\\'re designing a tool, for example, you can design itfor anyone from beginners to experts, and what\\'s good designfor one group might be bad for another.  The pointis, you have to pick some group of users.  I don\\'t think you caneven talk about good or bad design except withreference to some intended user.You\\'re most likely to get good design if the intended users includethe designer himself.  When you design somethingfor a group that doesn\\'t include you, it tends to be for peopleyou consider to be less sophisticated than you, not more sophisticated.That\\'s a problem, because looking down on the user, however benevolently,seems inevitably to corrupt the designer.I suspect that very few housingprojects in the US were designed by architects who expected to livein them.   You can see the same thingin programming languages.  C, Lisp, and Smalltalk were created fortheir own designers to use.  Cobol, Ada, and Java, were created   for other people to use.If you think you\\'re designing something for idiots, the odds arethat you\\'re not designing something good, even for idiots.Even if you\\'re designing something for the most sophisticatedusers, though, you\\'re still designing for humans.  It\\'s different in research.  In math youdon\\'t choose abstractions because they\\'reeasy for humans to understand; you choose whichever make theproof shorter.  I think this is true for the sciences generally.Scientific ideas are not meant to be ergonomic.Over in the arts, things are very different.  Design isall about people.  The human body is a strangething, but when you\\'re designing a chair,that\\'s what you\\'re designing for, and there\\'s no way around it.All the arts have to pander to the interests and limitationsof humans.   In painting, for example, all other things beingequal a painting with people in it will be more interesting thanone without.  It is not merely an accident of history thatthe great paintings of the Renaissance are all full of people.If they hadn\\'t been, painting as a medium wouldn\\'t have the prestigethat it does.Like it or not, programming languages are also for people,and I suspect the human brain is just as lumpy and idiosyncraticas the human body.  Some ideas are easy for people to graspand some aren\\'t.  For example, we seem to have a very limitedcapacity for dealing with detail.  It\\'s this fact that makesprograming languages a good idea in the first place; if wecould handle the detail, we could just program in machinelanguage.Remember, too, that languages are notprimarily a form for finished programs, but something thatprograms have to be developed in.  Anyone in the arts couldtell you that you might want different mediums for thetwo situations.  Marble, for example, is a nice, durablemedium for finished ideas, but a hopelessly inflexible onefor developing new ideas.A program, like a proof,is a pruned version of a tree that in the past has hadfalse starts branching off all over it.  So the test ofa language is not simply how clean the finished program looksin it, but how clean the path to the finished program was.A design choice that gives you elegant finished programsmay not give you an elegant design process.  For example, I\\'ve written a few macro-defining macros full of nestedbackquotes that look now like little gems, but writing themtook hours of the ugliest trial and error, and frankly, I\\'m stillnot entirely sure they\\'re correct.We often act as if the test of a language were how goodfinished programs look in it.It seems so convincing when you see the same programwritten in two languages, and one version is much shorter.When you approach the problem from the direction of thearts, you\\'re less likely to depend on this sort oftest.  You don\\'t want to end up with a programminglanguage like marble.For example, it is a huge win in developing software tohave an interactive toplevel, what in Lisp is called aread-eval-print loop.  And when you have one this hasreal effects on the design of the language.  It would notwork well for a language where you have to declarevariables before using them, for example.  When you\\'rejust typing expressions into the toplevel, you want to be able to set x to some value and then start doing thingsto x.  You don\\'t want to have to declare the type of xfirst.  You may dispute either of the premises, but ifa language has to have a toplevel to be convenient, andmandatory type declarations are incompatible with atoplevel, then no language that makes type declarations  mandatory could be convenient to program in.In practice, to get good design you have to get close, and stayclose, to your users.  You have to calibrate your ideas on actualusers constantly, especially in the beginning.  One of the reasonsJane Austen\\'s novels are so good is that she read them out loud toher family.  That\\'s why she never sinks into self-indulgently artydescriptions of landscapes,or pretentious philosophizing.  (The philosophy\\'s there, but it\\'swoven into the story instead of being pasted onto it like a label.)If you open an average \"literary\" novel and imagine reading it out loudto your friends as something you\\'d written, you\\'ll feel all tookeenly what an imposition that kind of thing is upon the reader.In the software world, this idea is known as Worse is Better.Actually, there are several ideas mixed together in the concept ofWorse is Better, which is why people are still arguing aboutwhether worseis actually better or not.  But one of the main ideas in thatmix is that if you\\'re building something new, you should get aprototype in front of users as soon as possible.The alternative approach might be called the Hail Mary strategy.Instead of getting a prototype out quickly and gradually refiningit, you try to create the complete, finished, product in one longtouchdown pass.  As far as I know, this is arecipe for disaster.  Countless startups destroyed themselves thisway during the Internet bubble.  I\\'ve never heard of a casewhere it worked.What people outside the software world may not realize is thatWorse is Better is found throughout the arts.In drawing, for example, the idea was discovered during theRenaissance.  Now almost every drawing teacher will tell you thatthe right way to get an accurate drawing is not towork your way slowly around the contour of an object, because errors willaccumulate and you\\'ll find at the end that the lines don\\'t meet.Instead you should draw a few quick lines in roughly the right place,and then gradually refine this initial sketch.In most fields, prototypeshave traditionally been made out of different materials.Typefaces to be cut in metal were initially designed  with a brush on paper.  Statues to be cast in bronze   were modelled in wax.  Patterns to be embroidered on tapestrieswere drawn on paper with ink wash.  Buildings to beconstructed from stone were tested on a smaller scale in wood.What made oil paint so exciting, when itfirst became popular in the fifteenth century, was that youcould actually make the finished workfromthe prototype.You could make a preliminary drawing if you wanted to, but youweren\\'t held to it; you could work out all the details, andeven make major changes, as you finished the painting.You can do this in software too.  A prototype doesn\\'t have tobe just a model; you can refine it into the finished product.I think you should always do this when you can.  It lets youtake advantage of new insights you have along the way.  Butperhaps even more important, it\\'s good for morale.Morale is key in design.  I\\'m surprised peopledon\\'t talk more about it.  One of my firstdrawing teachers told me: if you\\'re bored when you\\'redrawing something, the drawing will look boring.For example, suppose you have to draw a building, and youdecide to draw each brick individually.  You can do thisif you want, but if you get bored halfway through and startmaking the bricks mechanically instead of observing each one,   the drawing will look worse than if you had merely suggestedthe bricks.Building something by gradually refining a prototype is goodfor morale because it keeps you engaged.  In software, my  rule is: always have working code.  If you\\'re writingsomething that you\\'ll be able to test in an hour, then youhave the prospect of an immediate reward to motivate you.The same is true in the arts, and particularly in oil painting.Most painters start with a blurry sketch and graduallyrefine it.If you work this way, then in principleyou never have to end the day with something that actuallylooks unfinished.  Indeed, there is even a saying amongpainters: \"A painting is never finished, you just stopworking on it.\"  This idea will be familiar to anyone whohas worked on software.Morale is another reason that it\\'s hard to design somethingfor an unsophisticated user.   It\\'s hard to stay interested insomething you don\\'t like yourself.  To make something  good, you have to be thinking, \"wow, this is really great,\"not \"what a piece of shit; those fools will love it.\"Design means making things for humans.  But it\\'s not just theuser who\\'s human.  The designer is human too.Notice all this time I\\'ve been talking about \"the designer.\"Design usually has to be under the control of a single person tobe any good.   And yet it seems to be possible for several peopleto collaborate on a research project.  This seems tome one of the most interesting differences between research anddesign.There have been famous instances of collaboration in the arts,but most of them seem to have been cases of molecular bonding ratherthan nuclear fusion.  In an opera it\\'s common for one person towrite the libretto and another to write the music.   And during the Renaissance, journeymen from northernEurope were often employed to do the landscapes in thebackgrounds of Italian paintings.  But these aren\\'t true collaborations.They\\'re more like examples of Robert Frost\\'s\"good fences make good neighbors.\"  You can stick instancesof good design together, but within each individual project,one person has to be in control.I\\'m not saying that good design requires that one person thinkof everything.  There\\'s nothing more valuable than the adviceof someone whose judgement you trust.  But after the talking isdone, the decision about what to do has to rest with one person.Why is it that research can be done by collaborators and  design can\\'t?  This is an interesting question.  I don\\'t know the answer.  Perhaps,if design and research converge, the best research is alsogood design, and in fact can\\'t be done by collaborators.A lot of the most famous scientists seem to have worked alone.But I don\\'t know enough to say whether thereis a pattern here.  It could be simply that many famous scientistsworked when collaboration was less common.Whatever the story is in the sciences, true collaborationseems to be vanishingly rare in the arts.  Design by committee is asynonym for bad design.  Why is that so?  Is there some way tobeat this limitation?I\\'m inclined to think there isn\\'t-- that good design requiresa dictator.  One reason is that good design has to   be all of a piece.  Design is not just for humans, butfor individual humans.  If a design represents an idea that  fits in one person\\'s head, then the idea will fit in the user\\'shead too.Related:Japanese TranslationTaste for MakersRomanian TranslationSpanish Translation'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'One of the biggest things holding people back from doing great workis the fear of making something lame. And this fear is not anirrational one. Many great projects go through a stage early onwhere they don\\'t seem very impressive, even to their creators. Youhave to push through this stage to reach the great work that liesbeyond. But many people don\\'t. Most people don\\'t even reach thestage of making something they\\'re embarrassed by, let alone continuepast it. They\\'re too frightened even to start.Imagine if we could turn off the fear of making something lame.Imagine how much more we\\'d do.Is there any hope of turning it off? I think so. I think the habitsat work here are not very deeply rooted.Making new things is itself a new thing for us as a species. It hasalways happened, but till the last few centuries it happened soslowly as to be invisible to individual humans. And since we didn\\'tneed customs for dealing with new ideas, we didn\\'t develop any.We just don\\'t have enough experience with early versions of ambitiousprojects to know how to respond to them. We judge them as we wouldjudge more finished work, or less ambitious projects. We don\\'trealize they\\'re a special case.Or at least, most of us don\\'t. One reason I\\'m confident we can dobetter is that it\\'s already starting to happen. There are alreadya few places that are living in the future in this respect. SiliconValley is one of them: an unknown person working on a strange-soundingidea won\\'t automatically be dismissed the way they would back home.In Silicon Valley, people have learned how dangerous that is.The right way to deal with new ideas is to treat them as a challengeto your imagination — not just to have lower standards, but toswitch polarityentirely, from listing the reasons an idea won\\'twork to trying to think of ways it could. That\\'s what I do when Imeet people with new ideas. I\\'ve become quite good at it, but I\\'vehad a lot of practice. Being a partner at Y Combinator means beingpractically immersed in strange-sounding ideas proposed by unknownpeople. Every six months you get thousands of new ones thrown atyou and have to sort through them, knowing that in a world with apower-law distribution of outcomes, it will be painfully obviousif you miss the needle in this haystack. Optimism becomesurgent.But I\\'m hopeful that, with time, this kind of optimism can becomewidespread enough that it becomes a social custom, not just a trickused by a few specialists. It is after all an extremely lucrativetrick, and those tend to spread quickly.Of course, inexperience is not the only reason people are too harshon early versions of ambitious projects. They also do it to seemclever. And in a field where the new ideas are risky, like startups,those who dismiss them are in fact more likely to be right. Justnot when their predictions areweighted by outcome.But there is another more sinister reason people dismiss new ideas.If you try something ambitious, many of those around you will hope,consciously or unconsciously, that you\\'ll fail. They worry that ifyou try something ambitious and succeed, it will put you above them.In some countries this is not just an individual failing but partof the national culture.I wouldn\\'t claim that people in Silicon Valley overcome theseimpulses because they\\'re morally better.The reason many hopeyou\\'ll succeed is that they hope to rise with you. For investorsthis incentive is particularly explicit. They want you to succeedbecause they hope you\\'ll make them rich in the process. But manyother people you meet can hope to benefit in some way from yoursuccess. At the very least they\\'ll be able to say, when you\\'refamous, that they\\'ve known you since way back.But even if Silicon Valley\\'s encouraging attitudeis rooted in self-interest, it has over time actually grown into asort of benevolence. Encouraging startups has been practiced forso long that it has become a custom. Now it just seems that that\\'swhat one does with startups.Maybe Silicon Valley is too optimistic. Maybe it\\'s too easily fooledby impostors. Many less optimistic journalists want to believe that.But the lists of impostors they cite are suspiciously short, andplagued with asterisks.If you use revenue as the test, SiliconValley\\'s optimism seems better tuned than the rest of the world\\'s.And because it works, it will spread.There\\'s a lot more to new ideas than new startup ideas, of course.The fear of making something lame holds people back in every field.But Silicon Valley shows how quickly customs can evolve to supportnew ideas. And that in turn proves that dismissing new ideas is notso deeply rooted in human nature that it can\\'t be unlearnt.___________Unfortunately, if you want to do new things, you\\'ll face a forcemore powerful than other people\\'s skepticism: your own skepticism.You too will judge your early work too harshly. How do you avoidthat?This is a difficult problem, because you don\\'t want to completelyeliminate your horror of making something lame. That\\'s what steersyou toward doing good work. You just want to turn it off temporarily,the way a painkiller temporarily turns off pain.People have already discovered several techniques that work. Hardymentions two inA Mathematician\\'s Apology:Good work is not done by \"humble\" men. It is one of the first  duties of a professor, for example, in any subject, to exaggerate  a little both the importance of his subject and his importance  in it.If you overestimate the importance of what you\\'re working on, thatwill compensate for your mistakenly harsh judgment of your initialresults. If you look at something that\\'s 20% of the way to a goalworth 100 and conclude that it\\'s 10% of the way to a goal worth200, your estimate of its expected value is correct even thoughboth components are wrong.It also helps, as Hardy suggests, to be slightly overconfident.I\\'ve noticed in many fields that the most successful people areslightly overconfident. On the face of it this seems implausible.Surely it would be optimal to have exactly the right estimate ofone\\'s abilities. How could it be an advantage to be mistaken?Because this error compensates for other sources of error in theopposite direction: being slightly overconfident armors you againstboth other people\\'s skepticism and your own.Ignorance has a similar effect. It\\'s safe to make the mistake ofjudging early work as finished work if you\\'re a sufficiently laxjudge of finished work. I doubt it\\'s possible to cultivate thiskind of ignorance, but empirically it\\'s a real advantage, especiallyfor the young.Another way to get through the lame phase of ambitious projects isto surround yourself with the right people — to create an eddy inthe social headwind. But it\\'s not enough to collect people who arealways encouraging. You\\'d learn to discount that. You need colleagueswho can actually tell an ugly duckling from a baby swan. The peoplebest able to do this are those working on similar projects of theirown, which is why university departments and research labs work sowell. You don\\'t need institutions to collect colleagues. Theynaturally coalesce, given the chance. But it\\'s very much worthaccelerating this process by seeking out other people trying to donew things.Teachers are in effect a special case of colleagues. It\\'s a teacher\\'sjob both to see the promise of early work and to encourage you tocontinue. But teachers who are good at this are unfortunately quiterare, so if you have the opportunity to learn from one, take it.For some it might work to rely on sheer discipline: to tell yourselfthat you just have to press on through the initial crap phase andnot get discouraged. But like a lot of \"just tell yourself\" advice,this is harder than it sounds. And it gets still harder as you getolder, because your standards rise. The old do have one compensatingadvantage though: they\\'ve been through this before.It can help if you focus less on where you are and more on the rateof change. You won\\'t worry so much about doing bad work if you cansee it improving. Obviously the faster it improves, the easier thisis. So when you start something new, it\\'s good if you can spend alot of time on it. That\\'s another advantage of being young: youtend to have bigger blocks of time.Another common trick is to start by considering new work to be ofa different, less exacting type. To start a painting saying thatit\\'s just a sketch, or a new piece of software saying that it\\'sjust a quick hack. Then you judge your initial results by a lowerstandard. Once the project is rolling you can sneakily convert itto something more.This will be easier if you use a medium that lets you work fast anddoesn\\'t require too much commitment up front. It\\'s easier to convinceyourself that something is just a sketch when you\\'re drawing in anotebook than when you\\'re carving stone. Plus you get initial resultsfaster.It will be easier to try out a risky project if you think of it asa way to learn and not just as a way to make something. Then evenif the project truly is a failure, you\\'ll still have gained by it.If the problem is sharply enough defined, failure itself isknowledge: if the theorem you\\'re trying to prove turns out tobe false, or you use a structural member of a certain size andit fails under stress, you\\'ve learned something, even if itisn\\'t what you wanted to learn.One motivation that works particularly well for me is curiosity.I like to try new things just to see how they\\'ll turn out. We startedY Combinator in this spirit, and it was one of main things thatkept me going while I was working onBel. Having worked for so longwith various dialects of Lisp, I was very curious to see what itsinherent shape was: what you\\'d end up with if you followed theaxiomatic approach all the way.But it\\'s a bit strange that you have to play mind games with yourselfto avoid being discouraged by lame-looking early efforts. The thingyou\\'re trying to trick yourself into believing is in fact the truth.A lame-looking early version of an ambitious project truly is morevaluable than it seems. So the ultimate solution may be to teachyourself that.One way to do it is to study the histories of people who\\'vedone great work. What were they thinking early on? What was thevery first thing they did? It can sometimes be hard to get anaccurate answer to this question, because people are often embarrassedby their earliest work and make little effort to publish it. (Theytoo misjudge it.) But when you can get an accurate picture of thefirst steps someone made on the path to some great work, they\\'reoften pretty feeble.Perhaps if you study enough such cases, you can teach yourself tobe a better judge of early work. Then you\\'ll be immune both to otherpeople\\'s skepticism and your own fear of making something lame.You\\'ll see early work for what it is.Curiously enough, the solution to the problem of judging early worktoo harshly is to realize that our attitudes toward it are themselvesearly work. Holding everything to the same standard is a crudeversion 1. We\\'re already evolving better customs, and we can alreadysee signs of how big the payoff will be.'},\n",

And one of the most conspicuoustrends in the last batch was the large number of hardware startups.Out of 84 companies, 7 were making hardware.  On the wholethey've done better than the companies that weren't.They've faced resistance from investors of course.  Investors havea deep-seated bias against hardware.  But investors' opinions area trailing indicator.

They just haven'tbeen as great a way to start arapidly growingbusinessas software.  But that rule may not be permanent.  It's not eventhat old; it only dates from about 1990.  Maybe the advantageof software will turn out to have been temporary.  Hackers love tobuild hardware, and customers love to buy it.  So if the ease ofshipping hardware even approached the ease of shipping software,we'd see a lot more hardware startups.It wouldn't be the first time something was a bad idea till itwasn't.

H. Hardy,A Mathematician\\'s ApologyI was talking recently to a friend who teachesat MIT.  His field is hot now andevery year he is inundated by applications fromwould-be graduate students.  \"A lot of them seem smart,\"he said.  \"What I can\\'t tell is whether they have any kindof taste.\"Taste.  You don\\'t hear that word much now.And yet we still need the underlyingconcept, whatever we call it.  What my friend meant wasthat he wanted students who were not just good technicians,but who could use their technical knowledge todesign beautiful things.Mathematicians call good work \"beautiful,\"and so, either now or in the past, havescientists, engineers, musicians, architects, designers,writers, and painters.Is it just a coincidence that they used the same word, or is   there some overlap in what they meant?  If thereis an overlap, can we use one field\\'s discoveriesabout beauty to help us in another?For those of us who design things, these are not justtheoretical questions.  If there is such a thing asbeauty, we need to be able to recognize it.  We needgood taste to make good things.Instead oftreating beauty as an airy abstraction, to be either blatheredabout or avoided depending on how one feels about airyabstractions, let\\'s try considering it as a practical question:how do you make good stuff?If you mention taste nowadays, a lot of people will tellyou that \"taste is subjective.\"They believe this because it really feels thatway to them.  When they like something, they have no ideawhy.  It could be because it\\'s beautiful, or because theirmother had one, or because they saw a movie star with onein a magazine, or because they know it\\'s expensive.Their thoughts are a tangle of unexamined impulses.Most of us are encouraged, as children, to leave this tangleunexamined.  If you make fun of your little brother forcoloring people green in his coloring book, yourmother is likely to tell you something like \"you like todo it your way and he likes to do it his way.\"Your mother at this point is not trying to teach youimportant truths about aesthetics.  She\\'s trying to getthe two of you to stop bickering.Like many of the half-truths adults tell us, this onecontradicts other things they tell us.  After dinninginto you that taste is merely a matter of personal preference,they take you to the museum and tell you that you shouldpay attention because Leonardo is a great artist.What goes through the kid\\'s head at this point?  What doeshe think \"great artist\" means?  After having beentold for years that everyone just likes to dothings their own way, he isunlikely to head straight for the conclusion that a greatartist is someone whose work isbetterthan the others\\'.A far more likely theory, in his Ptolemaic model ofthe universe, is that a great artist is something that\\'sgood for you, like broccoli, because someone said so in a book.Saying that taste is just personal preference is a good wayto prevent disputes.  The trouble is, it\\'s not true.You feel this when you start to design things.Whatever job people do, they naturally want to do better.Football playerslike to win games.  CEOs like to increase earnings.  It\\'sa matter of pride, and a real pleasure, to get better atyour job. But ifyour job is to design things, and there is no such thingas beauty, then there isno way to get better at your job.If taste is just personal preference, then everyone\\'s is   already perfect: you like whatever you like, and that\\'s it.As in any job, as you continue to design things, you\\'ll getbetter at it.  Your tastes will change.  And, like anyonewho gets better at their job, you\\'ll know you\\'re gettingbetter.  If so,your old tastes werenot merely different, but worse.  Poof goes the axiom thattaste can\\'t be wrong.Relativism is fashionable at the moment, and that may hamperyou from thinking about taste, even as yours grows.But if you come out of the closet and admit, at least to yourself,that there is such a thing as good and bad design, then youcan start to study good design in detail.How hasyour taste changed?  When you made mistakes, whatcaused you to make them?  What have other people learned aboutdesign?Once you start to examine the question, it\\'s surprising howmuch different fields\\' ideas of beauty have in common.  The sameprinciples of good design crop up again and again.Good design is simple.You hear this from math topainting.  In math it means that a shorter proof tends to bea better one.  Where axioms are concerned, especially,less is more.  It means much the same thing in programming.For architects and designers it means that beauty shoulddepend on a few carefully chosen structural elementsrather than a profusion of superficial ornament.  (Ornamentis not in itself bad, only when it\\'s camouflage on insipidform.)  Similarly, in painting, astill life of a few carefully observed and solidlymodelled objects will tend to be more interesting than astretch of flashybut mindlessly repetitive painting of, say, a lace collar.In writing it means: say what you meanand say it briefly.It seems strange to have to emphasize simplicity.You\\'d think simple would be the default.  Ornateis more work.  But something seems to come over peoplewhen they try to be creative.  Beginning writers adopt   a pompous tone that doesn\\'t sound anything like the way they speak.  Designers trying to be artistic resort toswooshes and curlicues.  Painters discover that they\\'re expressionists.It\\'s all evasion.Underneaththe long words or the \"expressive\" brush strokes, thereis not much going on, and that\\'s frightening.When you\\'reforced to be simple, you\\'re forced to face the real problem.When you can\\'t deliver ornament, you have to deliversubstance.Good design is timeless.In math, every proof is timeless unless it contains a mistake.So what does Hardy mean when he says there is no permanent place for ugly mathematics?  He means the same thing Kelly Johnson did:if something is ugly, it can\\'t be the best solution.  Theremust be a better one, and eventuallysomeone will discover it.Aiming at timelessness is a way to makeyourself find the best answer:if you can imagine someone surpassing you, you should do it yourself.Some of the greatest masters did this so well that theyleft little room for those who came after.Every engraver since Durer has had to live in his shadow.Aiming at timelessness is also a way to evadethe grip of fashion.  Fashions almost by definitionchange with time, so if you can make something thatwill still look good far into the future, then itsappeal must derive more from merit and less from fashion.Strangely enough, if you want to make something that will appeal to future generations, one way to do it is totry to appeal to past generations.  It\\'s hard to guess whatthe future will be like, but we can be sure it will belike the past in caring nothing for present fashions.So if you can make something that appeals to people todayand would also have appealed to people in 1500, there is a goodchance it will appeal to people in 2500.Good design solves the right problem.The typicalstove has four burners arranged in a square, and a dialto control each.  How do you arrange the dials?  Thesimplest answer is to put them in a row.  But this is asimple answer to the wrong question.The dials are for humans to use, and if you put them in a row,the unlucky human will have to stop and think each timeabout which dial matches which burner.  Better to arrange the dialsin a square like the burners.A lot of bad design is industrious, but misguided.In the mid twentieth century there was a vogue forsetting text in sans-serif fonts.These fontsarecloser to the pure, underlying letterforms.But in text that\\'s not the problem you\\'re trying to solve. For legibility it\\'s more important that letters be easyto tell apart.It may look Victorian, but a Times Roman lowercase g iseasy to tell from a lowercase y.Problems can be improved as well as solutions.In software, an intractable problem can usually be replacedby an equivalent one that\\'s easy to solve.Physics progressed faster as the problem becamepredicting observable behavior, instead of reconciling itwith scripture.Good design is suggestive.Jane Austen\\'s novels contain almost nodescription; instead of telling you howeverything looks, she tells her story so well that you   envision the scene for yourself.Likewise, a painting that suggests is usually more engagingthan one that tells.  Everyone makes up their own story about theMona Lisa.In architecture and design, thisprinciple means that a building or object should let you use it how you want: a good building, for example, willserve as a backdrop for whatever life people want to lead in it, insteadof making them live as if they were executing a programwritten by the architect.In software, it means you should give users a fewbasic elements that they can combine as they wish, like Lego. In math it means a proof thatbecomes the basis for a lot of new work ispreferable to a proof that was difficult,but doesn\\'t lead to future discoveries; in thesciences generally, citation is considered a roughindicator of merit.Good design is often slightly funny.This onemay not always be true.  But Durer\\'sengravingsand Saarinen\\'swomb chairand thePantheonand theoriginalPorsche 911all seemto me slightly funny.  Godel\\'s incompleteness theoremseems like a practical joke.I think it\\'s because humor is related to strength.To have a sense of humor is to be strong:to keep one\\'s sense of humor is to shrug off misfortunes,and to lose one\\'s sense of humor is to be wounded by them.And so the mark-- or at least the prerogative-- of strengthis not to takeoneself too seriously.The confident will often, likeswallows, seem to be making fun of the whole process slightly,as Hitchcock does in his films or Bruegel in his paintings-- orShakespeare, for that matter.Good design may not have to be funny, but it\\'s hard toimagine something that could be called humorless also beinggood design.Good design is hard.If you look at the people who\\'vedone great work, one thing they all seem to have in common is that theyworked very hard.  If you\\'re not working hard,you\\'re probably wasting your time.Hard problems call for greatefforts.  In math, difficult proofs require ingenious solutions,and those tend to be interesting.  Ditto in engineering.When youhave to climb a mountain you toss everything unnecessaryout of your pack.  And so an architect who has to buildon a difficult site, or a small budget, will find that heis forced to produce an elegant design.  Fashions andflourishes get knocked aside by the difficult businessof solving the problem at all.Not every kind of hard is good.  There is good pain and bad pain.You want the kind of pain you get from going running, not thekind you get from stepping on a nail.A difficultproblem could be good for a designer, but a fickle client or unreliablematerials would not be.In art, the highest place has traditionally been given topaintings of people.  There is something to this tradition,and not just because pictures of faces get to pressbuttons in our brains that other pictures don\\'t.  We are so good at looking at faces that we force anyone whodraws them to work hard to satisfy us.  If youdraw a tree and you change the angle of a branchfive degrees, no one will know.  When you change the angleof someone\\'s eye five degrees, people notice.When Bauhaus designers adopted Sullivan\\'s \"form follows function,\"what they meant was, formshouldfollow function.  Andif function is hard enough, form is forced to follow it,because there is no effort to spare for error.  Wild animalsare beautiful because they have hard lives.Good design looks easy.Like great athletes,great designers make it look easy.  Mostly this isan illusion.  The easy, conversational tone of goodwriting comes only on the eighth rewrite.In science and engineering, some of the greatestdiscoveries seem so simple that you say to yourself,I could have thought of that.  The discoverer isentitled to reply, why didn\\'t you?Some Leonardo heads are just a few lines.  You lookat them and you think, all you have to do is get eightor ten lines in the right place and you\\'ve made this beautifulportrait.  Well, yes, but you have to get them inexactlythe right place.  The slightest errorwill make the whole thing collapse.Line drawings are in fact the most difficult visualmedium, because they demand near perfection.In math terms, they are a closed-form solution; lesser  artists literally solve the same problems by successiveapproximation.  One of the reasons kids give up drawingat ten or so is that they decide to startdrawing like grownups, and one of the first thingsthey try is a line drawing of a face.  Smack!In most fields the appearance of ease seems to come withpractice.  Perhaps what practice does is train yourunconscious mind to handle tasks that used torequire conscious thought.  In some casesyou literally train your body.  An expert pianist canplay notes faster than the brain can send signals tohis hand.  Likewise an artist, after a while, canmake visual perception flow in through his eye andout through his hand as automatically as someone tapping his foot toa beat.When people talk about being in\"the zone,\" I think what they mean is that thespinal cord has the situation under control.Your spinal cord is less hesitant, andit frees conscious thought for the hard problems.Good design uses symmetry.I think symmetry may justbe one way to achieve simplicity, but it\\'s important enoughto be mentioned on its own.Nature uses it a lot, which is a good sign.There are two kinds of symmetry, repetition and recursion.Recursion means repetition in subelements, like thepattern of veins in a leaf.Symmetry is unfashionable in some fields now, in reaction toexcesses in the past.  Architects started consciouslymaking buildings asymmetric in Victorian times and by the1920s asymmetry was an explicit premise of modernist architecture.Even these buildings only tended to be asymmetricabout major axes, though; there were hundreds of minor symmetries.In writing you find symmetry at every level, from the phrasesin a sentence to the plot of a novel.  You find the samein music and art.Mosaics (and some Cezannes) get extra visual punch by makingthe whole picture out of the same atoms.  Compositional symmetry yields some of the most memorable paintings,  especially when two halves react to one another, as in theCreation of AdamorAmerican Gothic.In math and engineering, recursion, especially, is a big win.Inductive proofs are wonderfully short.  In software,a problem that can be solved by recursion is nearly alwaysbest solved that way. The Eiffel Tower looks striking partlybecause it is a recursive solution, a tower on a tower.The danger of symmetry, and repetition especially, is thatit can be used as a substitute for thought.Good design resembles nature.It\\'s not so much thatresembling nature is intrinsically good as that naturehas had a long time to work on theproblem.  It\\'s a good sign when your answer resembles nature\\'s.It\\'s not cheating to copy.Few would deny that a story should be like life.Working from life is a valuable tool in painting too, though itsrole has often been misunderstood.The aim is not simply to make a record.The point of painting from life isthat it gives your mind something to chew on:  when youreyes are looking at something, your hand will do moreinteresting work.Imitating nature also works in engineering.  Boats havelong had spines and ribs like an animal\\'s ribcage.In some cases we may have to wait for better technology:early aircraft designers were mistaken todesign aircraft that looked like birds, because they didn\\'thave materials or power sources light enough (the Wrights\\' engineweighed 152 lbs. andgenerated only 12 hp.) or control systems sophisticatedenough for machines that flew like birds, but I couldimagine little unmanned reconnaissance planes flyinglike birds in fifty years.Now that we have enough computer power, we can imitate nature\\'s   method as well as its results.  Genetic algorithms may let uscreate things too complex to design in the ordinarysense.Good design is redesign.It\\'s rare to get things rightthe first time.  Experts expect to throw away some early work.They plan for plans to change.It takes confidence to throw work away.  You have to be able to think,there\\'s more where that came from.When people first start drawing, for example,they\\'re often reluctant to redo parts that aren\\'tright; they feel they\\'ve been lucky to get that far,   and if they try to redo something, it will turn out worse.  Insteadthey convince themselves that the drawing is not that bad,really-- in fact, maybe they meant it to look that way.Dangerous territory, that; if anything you shouldcultivate dissatisfaction.In Leonardo\\'sdrawingsthere are often fiveor six attempts to get a line right.The distinctive back of the Porsche911 only appeared in the redesign of an awkwardprototype.In Wright\\'s early plans for theGuggenheim,the right half was a ziggurat; he inverted it to get thepresent shape.Mistakes are natural.  Instead of treating themas disasters, make them easy to acknowledge and easy to fix.Leonardo more or less invented the sketch, as away to make drawing bear a greater weight of exploration.Open-source software has fewer bugs because it admits thepossibility of bugs.It helps to have a medium that makes change easy.When oil paint replaced tempera in the fifteenth century,it helpedpainters to deal with difficult subjects like the human figure because, unlike tempera, oil can be blended and overpainted.Good design can copy.Attitudes to copyingoften make a round trip.  A noviceimitates without knowing it; next he triesconsciously to be original; finally, he decides it\\'smore important to be right than original.Unknowing imitation is almost a recipe for bad design.If you don\\'t know where your ideas are coming from,you\\'re probably imitating an imitator.Raphael so pervaded mid-nineteenth century taste that almost anyone who tried to draw was imitating him, often at severalremoves.It was this, more than Raphael\\'s own work, that botheredthe Pre-Raphaelites.The ambitious are not content to imitate. Thesecond phase in the growth of taste is a consciousattempt at originality.I think thegreatest masters go on to achieve a kind of selflessness.They just want to get the right answer, and if part of theright answer has already been discovered by someone else,that\\'s no reason not to use it.They\\'re confident enough to take from anyone withoutfeeling that their own vision will be lost in the process.Good design is often strange.Some of the very best workhas an uncanny quality:Euler\\'s Formula, Bruegel\\'sHunters in the Snow,theSR-71,Lisp.  They\\'re not justbeautiful, but strangely beautiful.I\\'m not sure why.  It may just be my own stupidity.  Acan-opener must seem miraculous to a dog.  Maybe if I were smartenough it would seem the most natural thing in the world thatei*pi= -1.  It is after all necessarily true.Most of the qualities I\\'ve mentioned are things that can becultivated, but I don\\'t think it works to cultivate strangeness.The best you can do is not squash it if it starts to appear.Einstein didn\\'t try to make relativity strange.He tried to make it true, and the truth turned out to be strange.At an art school where I once studied, the students wantedmost of all to develop a personal style.But if you just try to make good things, you\\'ll  inevitably do it in a distinctive way, just as each personwalks in a distinctive way.  Michelangelo was not tryingto paint like Michelangelo.  He was just trying to paintwell; he couldn\\'t help painting like Michelangelo.The only style worth having is the one you can\\'t help.And this is especially true for strangeness.  There is noshortcut to it.  The Northwest Passage that the Mannerists,the Romantics, and two generations of American high schoolstudents have searched for does not seem to exist.  Theonly way to get there is to go through good and come outthe other side.Good design happens in chunks.The inhabitantsof fifteenth century Florence included Brunelleschi, Ghiberti,Donatello, Masaccio, Filippo Lippi, Fra Angelico, Verrocchio, Botticelli, Leonardo, and Michelangelo.Milan at the time was as big as Florence.How many fifteenth century Milanese artists can you name?Something was happening in Florence in the fifteenth century.And it can\\'t have been heredity, because it isn\\'t happening now.You have to assume that whateverinborn ability Leonardo and Michelangelo had, there werepeople born in Milan with just as much.  What happened tothe Milanese Leonardo?There are roughly a thousand timesas many people alive in the US right now as lived inFlorence during the fifteenth century.  A thousand Leonardosand a thousand Michelangelos walk among us.If DNA ruled, we should be greeted daily by artisticmarvels.  We aren\\'t, and the reason is that to make Leonardoyou need more than his innate ability.  You also need Florence in 1450.Nothing is more powerfulthan a community of talented people working on relatedproblems.  Genes count for little by comparison: being a geneticLeonardo was not enough to compensate for having been born   near Milan instead of Florence.Today we move around more, but great work still comesdisproportionately from a few hotspots:the Bauhaus, the Manhattan Project, theNew Yorker,Lockheed\\'s Skunk Works, Xerox Parc.At any given time there are afew hot topics and a few groups doing great work on them,and it\\'s nearly impossible to dogood work yourself if you\\'re too far removed from oneof these centers.  You can push or pull these trendsto some extent, but you can\\'t break away from them.(Maybeyoucan, but the Milanese Leonardo couldn\\'t.)Good design is often daring.At every period   of history, people have believed things that were just   ridiculous, and believed them so strongly that you risked  ostracism or even violence by saying otherwise.If our own time were any different, that would be remarkable.As far as I can tell itisn\\'t.This problem afflicts not just everyera, but in some degree every field.Much Renaissance art was in its time considered shockingly secular:according to Vasari, Botticelli repented and gave up painting, andFra Bartolommeo and Lorenzo di Credi actually burned some of theirwork.Einstein\\'s theory of relativity offended many contemporary physicists,and was not fully accepted for decades-- in France, not until the1950s.Today\\'s experimental error is tomorrow\\'s new theory.  Ifyou want to discover great new things, then instead of turninga blind eye to the places where conventional wisdom andtruth don\\'t quite meet, you should pay particular attention to them.As a practical matter, I think it\\'s easier to see uglinessthan to imagine beauty.  Most of the people who\\'ve made beautifulthings seem to have done it by fixing something that they    thought ugly.  Great work usually seems to happen because someone seessomething and thinks,I could do better than that.Giottosaw traditional Byzantine madonnas painted according to aformula that had satisfied everyone for centuries, and to himthey looked wooden and unnatural.Copernicus was so troubled by a hack that all his contemporariescould tolerate that he felt there must be a better solution.Intolerance for ugliness is not in itself enough.  You have tounderstand a field well before you develop a good nose forwhat needs fixing.  You have to do your homework.  But asyou become expert in a field, you\\'ll start to hear littlevoices saying,What a hack!  There must be a better way.Don\\'t ignore those voices.  Cultivate them.  The recipe forgreat work is: very exacting taste, plus the abilityto gratify it.'},\n",

But not all, becauseas I say in the talk, Pittsburgh has some important advantages overmost would-be startup hubs.)What would it take to make Pittsburgh into a startup hub, likeSilicon Valley?  I understand Pittsburgh pretty well,because I grew up here, in Monroeville. And I understand SiliconValley pretty well because that\\'s where I live now.  Could you getthat kind of startup ecosystem going here?When I agreed to speak here, I didn\\'t think I\\'d be able to give avery optimistic talk.  I thought I\\'d be talking about what Pittsburghcould do to become a startup hub, very much in the subjunctive.Instead I\\'m going to talk about what Pittsburgh can do.What changed my mind was an article I read in, of all places, theNewYork Timesfood section.  The title was \"Pittsburgh\\'s Youth-DrivenFood Boom.\"  To most people that might not even sound interesting,let alone something related to startups.  But it was electrifyingto me to read that title.  I don\\'t think I could pick a more promisingone if I tried.  And when I read the article I got even more excited.It said \"people ages 25 to 29 now make up 7.6 percent of allresidents, up from 7 percent about a decade ago.\"  Wow, I thought,Pittsburgh could be the next Portland.  It could become the coolplace all the people in their twenties want to go live.When I got here a couple days ago, I could feel the difference.  Ilived here from 1968 to 1984.  I didn\\'t realize it at the time, butduring that whole period the city was in free fall. On top of theflight to the suburbs that happened everywhere, the steel and nuclearbusinesses were both dying. Boy are things different now.  It\\'s notjust that downtown seems a lot more prosperous. There is an energyhere that was not here when I was a kid.When I was a kid, this was a place young people left. Now it\\'s aplace that attracts them.What does that have to do with startups?  Startups are madeof people, and the average age of the people in a typical startupis right in that 25 to 29 bracket.I\\'ve seen how powerful it is for a city to have those people.  Fiveyears ago they shifted the center of gravity of Silicon Valley fromthe peninsula to San Francisco.  Google and Facebook are on thepeninsula, but the next generation of big winners are all in SF.The reason the center of gravity shifted was the talent war, forprogrammers especially.  Most 25 to 29 year olds want to live inthe city, not down in the boring suburbs.  So whether they like itor not, founders know they have to be in the city.  I know multiplefounders who would have preferred to live down in the Valley proper,but who made themselves move to SF because they knew otherwisethey\\'d lose the talent war.So being a magnet for people in their twenties is a very promisingthing to be.  It\\'s hard to imagine a place becoming a startup hubwithout also being that.  When I read that statistic about theincreasing percentage of 25 to 29 year olds, I had exactly the samefeeling of excitement I get when I see a startup\\'s graphs start tocreep upward off the x axis.Nationally the percentage of 25 to 29 year olds is 6.8%.  That meansyou\\'re .8% ahead.  The population is 306,000, so we\\'re talking abouta surplus of about 2500 people.  That\\'s the population of a smalltown, and that\\'s just the surplus. So you have a toehold.  Now youjust have to expand it.And though \"youth-driven food boom\" may sound frivolous, it isanything but.  Restaurants and cafes are a big part of the personalityof a city.  Imagine walking down a street in Paris. What are youwalking past?  Little restaurants and cafes.  Imagine driving throughsome depressing random exurb.  What are you driving past?  Starbucksand McDonalds and Pizza Hut.   As Gertrude Stein said, there is nothere there. You could be anywhere.These independent restaurants and cafes are not just feeding people.They\\'re making there be a there here.So here is my first concrete recommendation for turning Pittsburghinto the next Silicon Valley: do everything you can to encouragethis youth-driven food boom.  What could the city do?  Treat thepeople starting these little restaurants and cafes as your users,and go ask them what they want.  I can guess at least one thingthey might want: a fast permit process.  San Francisco has left youa huge amount of room to beat them in that department.I know restaurants aren\\'t the prime mover though.  The prime mover,as the Times article said, is cheap housing.  That\\'s a big advantage.But that phrase \"cheap housing\" is a bit misleading.  There areplenty of places that are cheaper.  What\\'s special about Pittsburghis not that it\\'s cheap, but that it\\'s a cheap place you\\'d actuallywant to live.Part of that is the buildings themselves. I realized a long timeago, back when I was a poor twenty-something myself, that the bestdeals were places that had once been rich, and then became poor.If a place has always been rich, it\\'s nice but too expensive.  Ifa place has always been poor, it\\'s cheap but grim.  But if a placewas once rich and then got poor, you can find palaces for cheap.And that\\'s what\\'s bringing people here.  When Pittsburgh was rich,a hundred years ago, the people who lived here built big solidbuildings.  Not always in the best taste, but definitely solid.  Sohere is another piece of advice for becoming a startup hub: don\\'tdestroy the buildings that are bringing people here.  When citiesare on the way back up, like Pittsburgh is now, developers race totear down the old buildings.  Don\\'t let that happen.  Focus onhistoric preservation.  Big real estate development projects arenot what\\'s bringing the twenty-somethings here.  They\\'re the oppositeof the new restaurants and cafes; they subtract personality fromthe city.The empirical evidence suggests you cannot be too strict abouthistoric preservation.  The tougher cities are about it, the betterthey seem to do.But the appeal of Pittsburgh is not just the buildings themselves.It\\'s the neighborhoods they\\'re in. Like San Francisco and New York,Pittsburgh is fortunate in being a pre-car city.  It\\'s not toospread out. Because those 25 to 29 year olds do not like driving.They prefer walking, or bicycling, or taking public transport.  Ifyou\\'ve been to San Francisco recently you can\\'t help noticing thehuge number of bicyclists.  And this is not just a fad that thetwenty-somethings have adopted.  In this respect they have discovereda better way to live.  The beards will go, but not the bikes.  Citieswhere you can get around without driving are just better period.So I would suggest you do everything you can to capitalize on this.As with historic preservation, it seems impossible to go too far.Why not make Pittsburgh the most bicycle and pedestrian friendlycity in the country?  See if you can go so far that you make SanFrancisco seem backward by comparison.  If you do, it\\'s very unlikelyyou\\'ll regret it.  The city will seem like a paradise to the youngpeople you want to attract.  If they do leave to get jobs elsewhere,it will be with regret at leaving behind such a place.  And what\\'sthe downside?  Can you imagine a headline \"City ruined by becomingtoo bicycle-friendly?\"  It just doesn\\'t happen.So suppose cool old neighborhoods and cool little restaurants makethis the next Portland.  Will that be enough?  It will put you ina way better position than Portland itself, because Pittsburgh hassomething Portland lacks: a first-rate research university.  CMUplus little cafes means you have more than hipsters drinking lattes.It means you have hipsters drinking lattes while talking aboutdistributed systems.  Now you\\'re getting really close to SanFrancisco.In fact you\\'re better off than San Francisco in one way, becauseCMU is downtown, but Stanford and Berkeley are out in the suburbs.What can CMU do to help Pittsburgh become a startup hub?  Be aneven better research university.  CMU is one of the best universitiesin the world, but imagine what things would be like if it were thevery best, and everyone knew it.  There are a lot of ambitiouspeople who must go to the best place, wherever it is.  If CMU were it, they would all come here. There would bekids in Kazakhstan dreaming of one day living in Pittsburgh.Being that kind of talent magnet is the most important contributionuniversities can make toward making their city a startup hub.  Infact it is practically the only contribution they can make.But wait, shouldn\\'t universities be setting up programs with wordslike \"innovation\" and \"entrepreneurship\" in their names?  No, theyshould not.  These kind of things almost always turn out to bedisappointments.  They\\'re pursuing the wrong targets.  The way toget innovation is not to aim for innovation but to aim for somethingmore specific, like better batteries or better 3D printing.  Andthe way to learn about entrepreneurship is to do it, which youcan\\'tin school.I know it may disappoint some administrators to hear that the bestthing a university can do to encourage startups is to be a greatuniversity.  It\\'s like telling people who want to lose weight thatthe way to do it is to eat less.But if you want to know where startups come from, look at theempirical evidence.  Look at the histories of the most successfulstartups, and you\\'ll find they grow organically out of a couple offounders building something that starts as an interesting sideproject.  Universities are great at bringing together founders, butbeyond that the best thing they can do is get out of the way.  Forexample, by not claiming ownership of \"intellectual property\" thatstudents and faculty develop, and by having liberal rules aboutdeferred admission and leaves of absence.In fact, one of the most effective things a university could do toencourage startups is an elaborate form of getting out of the wayinvented by Harvard.  Harvard used to have exams for the fallsemester after Christmas.  At the beginning of January they hadsomething called \"Reading Period\" when you were supposed to bestudying for exams.  And Microsoft and Facebook have something incommon that few people realize: they were both started during ReadingPeriod.  It\\'s the perfect situation for producing the sort of sideprojects that turn into startups. The students are all on campus,but they don\\'t have to do anything because they\\'re supposed to bestudying for exams.Harvard may have closed this window, because a few years ago theymoved exams before Christmas and shortened reading period from 11days to 7.  But if a university really wanted to help its studentsstart startups, the empirical evidence, weighted by market cap,suggests the best thing they can do is literally nothing.The culture of Pittsburgh is another of its strengths.  It seemslike a city has to be socially liberal to be a startup hub,and it\\'s pretty clear why. A city has to tolerate strangeness tobe a home for startups, because startups are so strange.  And youcan\\'t choose to allow just the forms of strangeness that will turninto big startups, because they\\'re all intermingled.  You have totolerate all strangeness.That immediately rules outbig chunks of the US.  I\\'m optimisticit doesn\\'t rule out Pittsburgh.  One of the things I remember fromgrowing up here, though I didn\\'t realize at the time that there wasanything unusual about it, is how well people got along.  I\\'m stillnot sure why.  Maybe one reason was that everyone felt like animmigrant.  When I was a kid in Monroeville, people didn\\'t callthemselves American.  They called themselves Italian or Serbian orUkranian.  Just imagine what it must have been like here a hundredyears ago, when people were pouring in from twenty differentcountries.  Tolerance was the only option.What I remember about the culture of Pittsburgh is that it wasboth tolerant and pragmatic.  That\\'s how I\\'d describe the cultureof Silicon Valley too.  And it\\'s not a coincidence, because Pittsburghwas the Silicon Valley of its time.  This was a city where peoplebuilt new things.  And while the things people build have changed,the spirit you need to do that kind of work is the same.So although an influx of latte-swilling hipsters may be annoyingin some ways, I would go out of my way to encourage them.  And moregenerally to tolerate strangeness, even unto the degree wackoCalifornians do.  For Pittsburgh that is a conservative choice:it\\'s a return to the city\\'s roots.Unfortunately I saved the toughest part for last. There is one morething you need to be a startup hub, and Pittsburgh hasn\\'t got it:investors.  Silicon Valley has a big investor community becauseit\\'s had 50 years to grow one.  New York has a big investor communitybecause it\\'s full of people who like money a lot and are quick tonotice new ways to get it.  But Pittsburgh has neither of these.And the cheap housing that draws other people here has no effecton investors.If an investor community grows up here, it will happen the same wayit did in Silicon Valley: slowly and organically.  So I would notbet on having a big investor community in the short term.  Butfortunately there are three trends that make that less necessarythan it used to be.  One is that startups are increasingly cheapto start, so you just don\\'t need as much outside money as you usedto.  The second is that thanks to things like Kickstarter, a startupcan get to revenue faster.  You can put something on Kickstarterfrom anywhere.  The third is programs like Y Combinator.  A startupfrom anywhere in the world can go to YC for 3 months, pick upfunding, and then return home if they want.My advice is to make Pittsburgh a great place for startups, andgradually more of them will stick.  Some of those will succeed;some of their founders will become investors; and still more startupswill stick.This is not a fast path to becoming a startup hub. But it is atleast a path, which is something few other cities have.  And it\\'snot as if you have to make painful sacrifices in the meantime.Think about what I\\'ve suggested you should do.  Encourage localrestaurants, save old buildings, take advantage of density, makeCMU the best, promote tolerance.  These are the things that makePittsburgh good to live in now.  All I\\'m saying is that you shoulddo even more of them.And that\\'s an encouraging thought.  If Pittsburgh\\'s path to becominga startup hub is to be even more itself, then it has a good chanceof succeeding.  In fact it probably has the best chance of any cityits size.  It will take some effort, and a lot of time, but if anycity can do it, Pittsburgh can.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.October 2010After barely changing at all for decades, the startup fundingbusiness is now in what could, at least by comparison, be calledturmoil.  At Y Combinator we\\'ve seen dramatic changes in the fundingenvironment for startups.  Fortunately one of them is much highervaluations.The trends we\\'ve been seeing are probably not YC-specific.  I wishI could say they were, but the main cause is probably just that wesee trends first—partly because the startups we fund are veryplugged into the Valley and are quick to take advantage of anythingnew, and partly because we fund so many that we have enough datapoints to see patterns clearly.What we\\'re seeing now, everyone\\'s probably going to be seeing inthe next couple years.  So I\\'m going to explain what we\\'re seeing,and what that will mean for you if you try to raise money.Super-AngelsLet me start by describing what the world of startup funding usedto look like.  There used to be two sharply differentiated typesof investors: angels and venture capitalists.  Angels are individualrich people who invest small amounts of their own money, while VCsare employees of funds that invest large amounts of other people\\'s.For decades there were just those two types of investors, but nowa third type has appeared halfway between them: the so-calledsuper-angels.And VCs have been provoked by their arrivalinto making a lot of angel-style investments themselves.  So thepreviously sharp line between angels and VCs has become hopelesslyblurred.There used to be a no man\\'s land between angels and VCs.  Angelswould invest $20k to $50k apiece, and VCs usually a million or more.So an angel round meant a collection of angel investments thatcombined to maybe $200k, and a VC round meant a series A round inwhich a single VC fund (or occasionally two) invested $1-5 million.The no man\\'s land between angels and VCs was a very inconvenientone for startups, because it coincided with the amount many wantedto raise.  Most startups coming out of Demo Day wanted to raisearound $400k.  But it was a pain to stitch together that much outof angel investments, and most VCs weren\\'t interested in investmentsso small.  That\\'s the fundamental reason the super-angels haveappeared.  They\\'re responding to the market.The arrival of a new type of investor is big news for startups,because there used to be only two and they rarely competed with oneanother.  Super-angels compete with both angels and VCs.  That\\'sgoing to change the rules about how to raise money.  I don\\'t knowyet what the new rules will be, but it looks like most of the changeswill be for the better.A super-angel has some of the qualities of an angel, and some ofthe qualities of a VC.  They\\'re usually individuals, like angels.In fact many of the current super-angels were initially angels ofthe classic type.  But like VCs, they invest other people\\'s money.This allows them to invest larger amounts than angels:  a typicalsuper-angel investment is currently about $100k.  They make investmentdecisions quickly, like angels.  And they make a lot more investmentsper partner than VCs—up to 10 times as many.The fact that super-angels invest other people\\'s money makes themdoubly alarming to VCs. They don\\'t just compete for startups; theyalso compete for investors.  What super-angels really are is a newform of fast-moving, lightweight VC fund.   And those of us in thetechnology world know what usually happens when something comesalong that can be described in terms like that.  Usually it\\'s thereplacement.Will it be?  As of now, few of the startups that take money fromsuper-angels are ruling out taking VC money.  They\\'re just postponingit.  But that\\'s still a problem for VCs.  Some of the startups thatpostpone raising VC money may do so well on the angel money theyraise that they never bother to raise more.  And those who do raiseVC rounds will be able to get higher valuations when they do.  Ifthe best startups get 10x higher valuations when they raise seriesA rounds, that would cut VCs\\' returns from winners at least tenfold.So I think VC funds are seriously threatened by the super-angels.But one thing that may save them to some extent is the unevendistribution of startup outcomes: practically all the returns areconcentrated in a few big successes.  The expected value of a startupis the percentage chance it\\'s Google.  So to the extent that winningis a matter of absolute returns, the super-angels could win practicallyall the battles for individual startups and yet lose the war, ifthey merely failed to get those few big winners.  And there\\'s achance that could happen, because the top VC funds have betterbrands, and can also do more for their portfolio companies.Because super-angels make more investments per partner, they haveless partner per investment.  They can\\'t pay as much attention toyou as a VC on your board could.  How much is that extra attentionworth?  It will vary enormously from one partner to another.  There\\'sno consensus yet in the general case.  So for now this is somethingstartups are deciding individually.Till now, VCs\\' claims about how much value they added were sort oflike the government\\'s.  Maybe they made you feel better, but youhad no choice in the matter, if you needed money on the scale onlyVCs could supply.  Now that VCs have competitors, that\\'s going toput a market price on the help they offer.  The interesting thingis, no one knows yet what it will be.Do startups that want to get really big need the sort of advice andconnections only the top VCs can supply?  Or would super-angel moneydo just as well?  The VCs will say you need them, and the super-angelswill say you don\\'t.  But the truth is, no one knows yet, not eventhe VCs and super-angels themselves.   All the super-angels knowis that their new model seems promising enough to be worth trying,and all the VCs know is that it seems promising enough to worryabout.RoundsWhatever the outcome, the conflict between VCs and super-angels isgood news for founders.  And not just for the obvious reason thatmore competition for deals means better terms.  The whole shape ofdeals is changing.One of the biggest differences between angels and VCs is the amountof your company they want.  VCs want a lot.  In a series A roundthey want a third of your company, if they can get it.  They don\\'tcare much how much they pay for it, but they want a lot because thenumber of series A investments they can do is so small.  In atraditional series A investment, at least one partner from the VCfund takes a seat on your board.Since board seats last about5 years and each partner can\\'t handle more than about 10 at once,that means a VC fund can only do about 2 series A deals per partnerper year. And that means they need to get as much of the companyas they can in each one.  You\\'d have to be a very promising startupindeed to get a VC to use up one of his 10 board seats for only afew percent of you.Since angels generally don\\'t take board seats, they don\\'t have thisconstraint.  They\\'re happy to buy only a few percent of you.  Andalthough the super-angels are in most respects mini VC funds, they\\'veretained this critical property of angels.  They don\\'t take boardseats, so they don\\'t need a big percentage of your company.Though that means you\\'ll get correspondingly less attention fromthem, it\\'s good news in other respects.  Founders never really likedgiving up as much equity as VCs wanted.  It was a lot of the companyto give up in one shot.  Most founders doing series A deals wouldprefer to take half as much money for half as much stock, and thensee what valuation they could get for the second half of the stockafter using the first half of the money to increase its value.  ButVCs never offered that option.Now startups have another alternative.  Now it\\'s easy to raise angelrounds about half the size of series A rounds.  Many of the startupswe fund are taking this route, and I predict that will be true ofstartups in general.A typical big angel round might be $600k on a convertible note witha valuation cap of $4 million premoney.  Meaning that when the noteconverts into stock (in a later round, or upon acquisition), theinvestors in that round will get .6 / 4.6, or 13% of the company.That\\'s a lot less than the 30 to 40% of the company you usuallygive up in a series A round if you do it so early.But the advantage of these medium-sized rounds is not just thatthey cause less dilution.  You also lose less control.  After anangel round, the founders almost always still have control of thecompany, whereas after a series A round they often don\\'t.  Thetraditional board structure after a series A round is two founders,two VCs, and a (supposedly) neutral fifth person.  Plus series Aterms usually give the investors a veto over various kinds ofimportant decisions, including selling the company.  Founders usuallyhave a lot of de facto control after a series A, as long as thingsare going well.  But that\\'s not the same as just being able to dowhat you want, like you could before.A third and quite significant advantage of angel rounds is thatthey\\'re less stressful to raise.  Raising a traditional series Around has in the past taken weeks, if not months.  When a VC firmcan only do 2 deals per partner per year, they\\'re careful aboutwhich they do.  To get a traditional series A round you have to gothrough a series of meetings, culminating in a full partner meetingwhere the firm as a whole says yes or no.  That\\'s the really scarypart for founders: not just that series A rounds take so long, butat the end of this long process the VCs might still say no.  Thechance of getting rejected after the full partner meeting averagesabout 25%.  At some firms it\\'s over 50%.Fortunately for founders, VCs have been getting a lot faster.Nowadays Valley VCs are more likely to take 2 weeks than 2 months.But they\\'re still not as fast as angels and super-angels, the mostdecisive of whom sometimes decide in hours.Raising an angel round is not only quicker, but you get feedbackas it progresses.  An angel round is not an all or nothing thinglike a series A.  It\\'s composed of multiple investors with varyingdegrees of seriousness, ranging from the upstanding ones who commitunequivocally to the jerks who give you lines like \"come back tome to fill out the round.\" You usually start collecting money fromthe most committed investors and work your way out toward theambivalent ones, whose interest increases as the round fills up.But at each point you know how you\\'re doing.  If investors turncold you may have to raise less, but when investors in an angelround turn cold the process at least degrades gracefully, insteadof blowing up in your face and leaving you with nothing, as happensif you get rejected by a VC fund after a full partner meeting.Whereas if investors seem hot, you can not only close the roundfaster, but now that convertible notes are becoming the norm,actuallyraise the priceto reflect demand.ValuationHowever, the VCs have a weapon they can use against the super-angels,and they have started to use it.   VCs have started making angel-sizedinvestments too.  The term \"angel round\" doesn\\'t mean that all theinvestors in it are angels; it just describes the structure of theround.  Increasingly the participants include VCs making investmentsof a hundred thousand or two.  And when VCs invest in angel roundsthey can do things that super-angels don\\'t like.  VCs are quitevaluation-insensitive in angel rounds—partly because they arein general, and partly because they don\\'t care that much about thereturns on angel rounds, which they still view mostly as a way torecruit startups for series A rounds later.  So VCs who invest inangel rounds can blow up the valuations for angels and super-angelswho invest in them.Some super-angels seem to care about valuations.  Several turneddown YC-funded startups after Demo Day because their valuationswere too high.  This was not a problem for the startups; by definitiona high valuation means enough investors were willing to accept it.But it was mysterious to me that the super-angels would quibbleabout valuations.  Did they not understand that the big returnscome from a few big successes, and that it therefore mattered farmore which startups you picked than how much you paid for them?After thinking about it for a while and observing certain othersigns, I have a theory that explains why the super-angels may besmarter than they seem.  It would make sense for super-angels towant low valuations if they\\'re hoping to invest in startups thatget bought early.  If you\\'re hoping to hit the next Google, youshouldn\\'t care if the valuation is 20 million.  But if you\\'re lookingfor companies that are going to get bought for 30 million, you care.If you invest at 20 and the company gets bought for 30, you onlyget 1.5x.  You might as well buy Apple.So if some of the super-angels were looking for companies that couldget acquired quickly, that would explain why they\\'d care aboutvaluations.  But why would they be looking for those?   Becausedepending on the meaning of \"quickly,\" it could actually be veryprofitable.  A company that gets acquired for 30 million is a failureto a VC, but it could be a 10x return for an angel, and moreover,aquick10x return.  Rate of return is what matters ininvesting—not the multiple you get, but the multiple per year.If a super-angel gets 10x in one year, that\\'s a higher rate ofreturn than a VC could ever hope to get from a company that took 6years to go public.  To get the same rate of return, the VC wouldhave to get a multiple of 10^6—one million x.  Even Googledidn\\'t come close to that.So I think at least some super-angels are looking for companiesthat will get bought.  That\\'s the only rational explanation forfocusing on getting the right valuations, instead of the rightcompanies.  And if so they\\'ll be different to deal with than VCs.They\\'ll be tougher on valuations, but more accommodating if you wantto sell early.PrognosisWho will win, the super-angels or the VCs?  I think the answer tothat is, some of each.  They\\'ll each become more like one another.The super-angels will start to invest larger amounts, and the VCswill gradually figure out ways to make more, smaller investmentsfaster.  A decade from now the players will be hard to tell apart,and there will probably be survivors from each group.What does that mean for founders?  One thing it means is that thehigh valuations startups are presently getting may not last forever.To the extent that valuations are being driven up by price-insensitiveVCs, they\\'ll fall again if VCs become more like super-angels andstart to become more miserly about valuations.  Fortunately if thisdoes happen it will take years.The short term forecast is more competition between investors, whichis good news for you.  The super-angels will try to undermine theVCs by acting faster, and the VCs will try to undermine thesuper-angels by driving up valuations.  Which for founders willresult in the perfect combination: funding rounds that close fast,with high valuations.But remember that to get that combination, your startup will haveto appeal to both super-angels and VCs.  If you don\\'t seem like youhave the potential to go public, you won\\'t be able to use VCs todrive up the valuation of an angel round.There is a danger of having VCs in an angel round: the so-calledsignalling risk.  If VCs are only doing it in the hope of investingmore later, what happens if they don\\'t?  That\\'s a signal to everyoneelse that they think you\\'re lame.How much should you worry about that?  The seriousness of signallingrisk depends on how far along you are.  If by the next time youneed to raise money, you have graphs showing rising revenue ortraffic month after month, you don\\'t have to worry about any signalsyour existing investors are sending.  Your results will speak forthemselves.Whereas if the next time you need to raise money you won\\'t yet haveconcrete results, you may need to think more about the message yourinvestors might send if they don\\'t invest more.  I\\'m not sure yethow much you have to worry, because this whole phenomenon of VCsdoing angel investments is so new. But my instincts tell me youdon\\'t have to worry much.  Signalling risk smells like one of thosethings founders worry about that\\'s not a real problem.  As a rule,the only thing that can kill a good startup is the startup itself.Startups hurt themselves way more often than competitors hurt them,for example.  I suspect signalling risk is in this category too.One thing YC-funded startups have been doing to mitigate the riskof taking money from VCs in angel rounds is not to take too muchfrom any one VC.  Maybe that will help, if you have the luxury ofturning down money.Fortunately, more and more startups will.  After decades of competitionthat could best be described as intramural, the startup fundingbusiness is finally getting some real competition.  That shouldlast several years at least, and maybe a lot longer. Unless there\\'ssome huge market crash, the next couple years are going to be agood time for startups to raise money.  And that\\'s exciting becauseit means lots more startups will happen.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'I recently got an email from a founder that helped me understandsomething important: why it\\'s safe for startup founders to be nicepeople.I grew up with a cartoon idea of a very successful businessman (inthe cartoon it was always a man): a rapacious, cigar-smoking,table-thumping guy in his fifties who wins by exercising power, andisn\\'t too fussy about how.  As I\\'vewritten before, one ofthe things that has surprised me most about startups ishow fewofthe most successful founders are like that.  Maybe successful peoplein other industries are; I don\\'t know; but not startup founders.I knew this empirically, but I never saw the math of why till I gotthis founder\\'s email.  In it he said he worried that he wasfundamentally soft-hearted and tended to give away too much forfree. He thought perhaps he needed \"a little dose of sociopath-ness.\"I told him not to worry about it, because so long as he builtsomething good enough to spread by word of mouth, he\\'d have asuperlinear growth curve.  If he was bad at extracting money frompeople, at worst this curve would be some constant multiple lessthan 1 of what it might have been.  But a constant multiple of anycurve is exactly the same shape.  The numbers on the Y axis aresmaller, but the curve is just as steep, and when anything growsat the rate of a successful startup, the Y axis will take care ofitself.Some examples will make this clear.  Suppose your company is making$1000 a month now, and you\\'ve made something so great that it\\'sgrowing at 5% a week.  Two years from now, you\\'ll be making about$160k a month.Now suppose you\\'re so un-rapacious that you only extract half asmuch from your users as you could.  That means two years lateryou\\'ll be making $80k a month instead of $160k.  How far behind areyou? How long will it take to catch up with where you\\'d have beenif you were extracting every penny?  A mere 15 weeks.  After twoyears, the un-rapacious founder is only 3.5 months behind therapacious one.If you\\'re going to optimize a number, the one to choose is yourgrowth rate. Suppose as before that you only extract half as muchfrom users as you could, but that you\\'re able to grow 6% a weekinstead of 5%.  Now how are you doing compared to the rapaciousfounder after two years?  You\\'re already ahead—$214k a monthversus $160k—and pulling away fast.  In another year you\\'ll bemaking $4.4 million a month to the rapacious founder\\'s $2 million.Obviously one case where it would help to be rapacious is whengrowth depends on that.  What makes startups different is thatusually it doesn\\'t. Startups usually win by making something sogreat that people recommend it to their friends.  And being rapaciousnot only doesn\\'t help you do that, but probably hurts.The reason startup founders can safely be nice is that making greatthings is compounded, and rapacity isn\\'t.So if you\\'re a founder, here\\'s a deal you can make with yourselfthat will both make you happy and make your company successful.Tell yourself you can be as nice as you want, so long as you workhard on your growth rate to compensate.  Most successful startupsmake that tradeoff unconsciously. Maybe if you do it consciouslyyou\\'ll do it even better.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': \"If the world were static, we could have monotonically increasingconfidence in our beliefs.  The more (and more varied) experiencea belief survived, the less likely it would be false.  Most peopleimplicitly believe something like this about their opinions.  Andthey're justified in doing so with opinions about things that don'tchange much, like human nature.  But you can't trust your opinionsin the same way about things that change, which could includepractically everything else.When experts are wrong, it's often because they're experts on anearlier version of the world.Is it possible to avoid that?  Can you protect yourself againstobsolete beliefs?  To some extent, yes. I spent almost a decadeinvesting in early stage startups, and curiously enough protectingyourself against obsolete beliefs is exactly what you have to doto succeed as a startup investor.  Most really good startup ideaslook like bad ideas at first, and many of those look bad specificallybecause some change in the world just switched them from bad togood.  I spent a lot of time learning to recognize such ideas, andthe techniques I used may be applicable to ideas in general.The first step is to have an explicit belief in change.  People whofall victim to a monotonically increasing confidence in theiropinions are implicitly concluding the world is static.  If youconsciously remind yourself it isn't, you start to look for change.Where should one look for it?  Beyond the moderately usefulgeneralization that human nature doesn't change much, the unfortunatefact is that change is hard to predict.  This is largely a tautologybut worth remembering all the same: change that matters usuallycomes from an unforeseen quarter.So I don't even try to predict it.  When I get asked in interviewsto predict the future, I always have to struggle to come up withsomething plausible-sounding on the fly, like a student who hasn'tprepared for an exam.But it's not out of laziness that I haven'tprepared.  It seems to me that beliefs about the future are sorarely correct that they usually aren't worth the extra rigiditythey impose, and that the best strategy is simply to be aggressivelyopen-minded.  Instead of trying to point yourself in the rightdirection, admit you have no idea what the right direction is, andtry instead to be super sensitive to the winds of change.It's ok to have working hypotheses, even though they may constrainyou a bit, because they also motivate you.  It's exciting to chasethings and exciting to try to guess answers.  But you have to bedisciplined about not letting your hypotheses harden into anythingmore.I believe this passive m.o. works not just for evaluating new ideasbut also for having them.  The way to come up with new ideas is notto try explicitly to, but to try to solve problems and simply notdiscount weird hunches you have in the process.The winds of change originate in the unconscious minds of domainexperts.  If you're sufficiently expert in a field, any weird ideaor apparently irrelevant question that occurs to you is ipso factoworth exploring.Within Y Combinator, when an idea is describedas crazy, it's a compliment—in fact, on average probably ahigher compliment than when an idea is described as good.Startup investors have extraordinary incentives for correctingobsolete beliefs.  If they can realize before other investors thatsome apparently unpromising startup isn't, they can make a hugeamount of money.  But the incentives are more than just financial.Investors' opinions are explicitly tested: startups come to themand they have to say yes or no, and then, fairly quickly, they learnwhether they guessed right.  The investors who say no to a Google(and there were several) will remember it for the rest of theirlives.Anyone who must in some sense bet on ideas rather than merelycommenting on them has similar incentives.  Which means anyone whowants such incentives can have them, by turning their comments intobets: if you write about a topic in some fairly durable and publicform, you'll find you worry much more about getting things rightthan most people would in a casual conversation.Another trick I've found to protect myself against obsolete beliefsis to focus initially on people rather than ideas. Though the natureof future discoveries is hard to predict, I've found I can predictquite well what sort of people will make them.  Good new ideas comefrom earnest, energetic, independent-minded people.Betting on people over ideas saved me countless times as an investor.We thought Airbnb was a bad idea, for example. But we could tellthe founders were earnest, energetic, and independent-minded.(Indeed, almost pathologically so.)  So we suspended disbelief andfunded them.This too seems a technique that should be generally applicable.Surround yourself with the sort of people new ideas come from.  Ifyou want to notice quickly when your beliefs become obsolete, youcan't do better than to be friends with the people whose discoverieswill make them so.It's hard enough already not to become the prisoner of your ownexpertise, but it will only get harder, because change is accelerating.That's not a recent trend; change has been accelerating since thepaleolithic era.  Ideas beget ideas.  I don't expect that to change.But I could be wrong.\"},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.September 2010The reason startups have been usingmore convertible notesin angelrounds is that they make deals close faster.  By making it easierfor startups to give different prices to different investors, theyhelp them break the sort of deadlock that happens when investorsall wait to see who else is going to invest.By far the biggest influence on investors\\' opinions of a startupis the opinion of other investors.  There are very, very few whosimply decide for themselves.  Any startup founder can tell you themost common question they hear from investors is not about thefounders or the product, but \"who else is investing?\"That tends to produce deadlocks.  Raising an old-fashioned fixed-size equity round can take weeks, because all the angels sit aroundwaiting for the others to commit, like competitors in a bicyclesprint who deliberately ride slowly at the start so they can followwhoever breaks first.Convertible notes let startups beat such deadlocks by rewardinginvestors willing to move first with lower (effective) valuations.Which they deserve because they\\'re taking more risk.  It\\'s muchsafer to invest in a startup Ron Conway has already invested in;someone who comes after him should pay a higher price.The reason convertible notes allow more flexibility in price isthat valuation caps aren\\'t actual valuations, and notes are cheapand easy to do.  So you can do high-resolution fundraising: if youwanted you could have a separate note with a different cap for eachinvestor.That cap need not simply rise monotonically.  A startup could also give better deals to investors they expected to helpthem most.  The point is simply that different investors, whether because of the help they offer or their willingness tocommit, have different values forstartups, and their terms should reflect that.Different terms for different investors isclearly the way of the future.  Markets always evolve toward higherresolution.  You may not need to use convertible notes to do it.With sufficiently lightweight standardized equity terms (and somechanges in investors\\' and lawyers\\' expectations about equity rounds)you might be able to do the same thing with equity instead of debt.Either would be fine with startups, so long as they can easilychange their valuation.Deadlocks weren\\'t the only problem with fixed-size equity rounds.Another was that startups had to decide in advance how much toraise.  I think it\\'s a mistake for a startup to fix upon a specificnumber. If investors are easily convinced, the startup should raise morenow, and if investors are skeptical, the startup should take asmaller amount and use that to get the company to the point whereit\\'s more convincing.It\\'s just not reasonable to expect startups to pick an optimal roundsize in advance, because that depends on the reactions of investors,and those are impossible to predict.Fixed-size, multi-investor angel rounds are such a bad idea forstartups that one wonders why things were ever done that way.  Onepossibility is that this custom reflects the way investors like tocollude when they can get away with it.  But I think the actualexplanation is less sinister.  I think angels (and their lawyers)organized rounds this way in unthinking imitation of VC series Arounds.  In a series A, a fixed-size equity round with a lead makessense, because there is usually just one big investor, who isunequivocally the lead.  Fixed-size series A rounds already arehigh res.  But the more investors you have in a round, the lesssense it makes for everyone to get the same price.The most interesting question here may be what high res fundraisingwill do to the world of investors.  Bolder investors will now getrewarded with lower prices.  But more important, in ahits-driven business, is that they\\'ll be able to get into the dealsthey want.  Whereas the \"who else is investing?\" type of investorswill not only pay higher prices, but may not be able to get intothe best deals at all.'},\n",
       " {'title': \"What I've Learned from Hacker News\",\n",
       "  'date': 'February 2009',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'Hacker News was two yearsold last week.  Initially it was supposed to be a side project—anapplication to sharpen Arc on, and a place for current and futureY Combinator founders to exchange news.  It\\'s grown bigger and takenup more time than I expected, but I don\\'t regret that because I\\'velearned so much from working on it.GrowthWhen we launched in February 2007, weekday traffic was around 1600daily uniques.  It\\'s sincegrownto around 22,000.  This growthrate is a bit higher than I\\'d like.  I\\'d like the site to grow,since a site that isn\\'t growing at least slowly is probably dead.But I wouldn\\'t want it to grow as large as Digg or Reddit—mainlybecause that would dilute the character of the site, but also becauseI don\\'t want to spend all my time dealing with scaling.I already have problems enough with that.  Remember, the originalmotivation for HN was to test a new programming language, andmoreover one that\\'s focused on experimenting with language design,not performance.  Every time the site gets slow, I fortify myselfby recalling McIlroy and Bentley\\'s famous quoteThe key to performance is elegance, not battalions of special  cases.and look for the bottleneck I can remove with least code.  So farI\\'ve been able to keep up, in the sense that performance has remainedconsistently mediocre despite 14x growth. I don\\'t know what I\\'lldo next, but I\\'ll probably think of something.This is my attitude to the site generally.  Hacker News is anexperiment, and an experiment in a very young field.  Sites of thistype are only a few years old.  Internet conversation generally isonly a few decades old.  So we\\'ve probably only discovered a fractionof what we eventually will.That\\'s why I\\'m so optimistic about HN.  When a technology is thisyoung, the existing solutions are usually terrible; which means itmust be possible to do much better; which means many problems thatseem insoluble aren\\'t. Including, I hope, the problem that hasafflicted so many previous communities: being ruined by growth.DilutionUsers have worried about that since the site was a few months old.So far these alarms have been false, but they may not always be.Dilution is a hard problem. But probably soluble; it doesn\\'t meanmuch that open conversations have \"always\" been destroyed by growthwhen \"always\" equals 20 instances.But it\\'s important to remember we\\'re trying to solve a new problem,because that means we\\'re going to have to try new things, most ofwhich probably won\\'t work.  A couple weeks ago I tried displayingthe names of users with the highest average comment scores in orange.That was a mistake.  Suddenly a culture that had been moreor less united was divided into haves and have-nots.  I didn\\'trealize how united the culture had been till I saw it divided.  Itwas painful to watch.So orange usernames won\\'t be back.  (Sorry about that.)  But therewill be other equally broken-seeming ideas in the future, and theones that turn out to work will probably seem just as broken asthose that don\\'t.Probably the most important thing I\\'ve learned about dilution isthat it\\'s measured more in behavior than users. It\\'s bad behavioryou want to keep out more than bad people. User behavior turns outto be surprisingly malleable.  If people areexpectedto behavewell, they tend to; and vice versa.Though of course forbidding bad behavior does tend to keep away badpeople, because they feel uncomfortably constrained in a place wherethey have to behave well.  But this way of keeping them out isgentler and probably also more effective than overt barriers.It\\'s pretty clear now that the broken windows theory applies tocommunity sites as well.  The theory is that minor forms of badbehavior encourage worse ones: that a neighborhood with lots ofgraffiti and broken windows becomes one where robberies occur.  Iwas living in New York when Giuliani introduced the reforms thatmade the broken windows theory famous, and the transformation wasmiraculous. And I was a Reddit user when the opposite happenedthere, and the transformation was equally dramatic.I\\'m not criticizing Steve and Alexis.  What happened to Redditdidn\\'t happen out of neglect.  From the start they had a policy ofcensoring nothing except spam.  Plus Reddit had different goalsfrom Hacker News.  Reddit was a startup, not a side project; itsgoal was to grow as fast as possible.  Combine rapid growth andzero censorship, and the result is a free for all.  But I don\\'tthink they\\'d do much differently if they were doing it again.Measured by traffic, Reddit is much more successful than HackerNews.But what happened to Reddit won\\'t inevitably happen to HN. Thereare several local maxima.  There can be places that are free foralls and places that are more thoughtful, just as there are in thereal world; and people will behave differently depending on whichthey\\'re in, just as they do in the real world.I\\'ve observed this in the wild.  I\\'ve seen people cross-posting onReddit and Hacker News who actually took the trouble to write twoversions, a flame for Reddit and a more subdued version for HN.SubmissionsThere are two major types of problems a site like Hacker News needsto avoid: bad stories and bad comments.  So far the danger of badstories seems smaller.  The stories on the frontpage now are stillroughly the ones that would have been there when HN started.I once thought I\\'d have to weight votes to keep crap off thefrontpage, but I haven\\'t had to yet.  I wouldn\\'t have predicted thefrontpage would hold up so well, and I\\'m not sure why it has.Perhaps only the more thoughtful users care enough to submit andupvote links, so the marginal cost of one random new user approacheszero.  Or perhaps the frontpage protects itself, by advertising what type of submission is expected.The most dangerous thing for the frontpage is stuff that\\'s too easyto upvote.  If someone proves a new theorem, it takes some work bythe reader to decide whether or not to upvote it.  An amusing cartoontakes less.  A rant with a rallying cry as the title takes zero,because people vote it up without even reading it.Hence what I call the Fluff Principle: on a user-voted news site,the links that are easiest to judge will take over unless you takespecific measures to prevent it.Hacker News has two kinds of protections against fluff.  The mostcommon types of fluff links are banned as off-topic.  Pictures ofkittens, political diatribes, and so on are explicitly banned.  Thiskeeps out most fluff, but not all of it.  Some links are both fluff,in the sense of being very short, and also on topic.There\\'s no single solution to that.  If a link is just an emptyrant, editors will sometimes kill it even if it\\'s on topic in thesense of being about hacking, because it\\'s not on topic by the realstandard, which is to engage one\\'s intellectual curiosity.  If theposts on a site are characteristically of this type I sometimes banit, which means new stuff at that url is auto-killed.  If a posthas a linkbait title, editors sometimes rephrase it to be morematter-of-fact.  This is especially necessary with links whosetitles are rallying cries, because otherwise they become implicit\"vote up if you believe such-and-such\" posts, which are the mostextreme form of fluff.The techniques for dealing with links have to evolve, because thelinks do. The existence of aggregators has already affected whatthey aggregate. Writers now deliberately write things to draw trafficfrom aggregators—sometimes even specific ones.  (No, the ironyof this statement is not lost on me.)  Then there are the moresinister mutations, like linkjacking—posting a paraphrase ofsomeone else\\'s article and submitting that instead of the original.These can get a lot of upvotes, because a lot of what\\'s good in anarticle often survives; indeed, the closer the paraphrase is toplagiarism, the more survives.I think it\\'s important that a site that kills submissions providea way for users to see what got killed if they want to.  That keepseditors honest, and just as importantly, makes users confidentthey\\'d know if the editors stopped being honest. HN users can dothis by flipping a switch called showdead in their profile.CommentsBad comments seem to be a harder problem than bad submissions.While the quality of links on the frontpage of HN hasn\\'t changedmuch, the quality of the median comment may have decreased somewhat.There are two main kinds of badness in comments: meanness andstupidity.  There is a lot of overlap between the two—meancomments are disproportionately likely also to be dumb—butthe strategies for dealing with them are different.  Meanness iseasier to control.  You can have rules saying one shouldn\\'t be mean,and if you enforce them it seems possible to keep a lid on meanness.Keeping a lid on stupidity is harder, perhaps because stupidity isnot so easily distinguishable.  Mean people are more likely to knowthey\\'re being mean than stupid people are to know they\\'re beingstupid.The most dangerous form of stupid comment is not the long butmistaken argument, but the dumb joke.  Long but mistaken argumentsare actually quite rare.  There is a strong correlation betweencomment quality and length; if you wanted to compare the qualityof comments on community sites, average length would be a goodpredictor.  Probably the cause is human nature rather than anythingspecific to comment threads. Probably it\\'s simply that stupiditymore often takes the form of having few ideas than wrong ones.Whatever the cause, stupid comments tend to be short.  And sinceit\\'s hard to write a short comment that\\'s distinguished for theamount of information it conveys, people try to distinguish theminstead by being funny.  The most tempting format for stupid commentsis the supposedly witty put-down, probably because put-downs arethe easiest form of humor.So one advantage of forbiddingmeanness is that it also cuts down on these.Bad comments are like kudzu: they take over rapidly. Comments havemuch more effect on new comments than submissions have on newsubmissions.  If someone submits a lame article, the other submissionsdon\\'t all become lame.  But if someone posts a stupid comment on athread, that sets the tone for the region around it.  People replyto dumb jokes with dumb jokes.Maybe the solution is to add a delay before people can respond toa comment, and make the length of the delay inversely proportionalto some prediction of its quality.  Then dumb threads would growslower.PeopleI notice most of the techniques I\\'ve described are conservative:they\\'re aimed at preserving the character of the site rather thanenhancing it.  I don\\'t think that\\'s a bias of mine.  It\\'s due tothe shape of the problem.  Hacker News had the good fortune to startout good, so in this case it\\'s literally a matter of preservation.But I think this principle would also apply to sites with differentorigins.The good things in a community site come from people more thantechnology; it\\'s mainly in the prevention of bad things thattechnology comes into play. Technology certainly can enhancediscussion.  Nested comments do, for example.  But I\\'d rather usea site with primitive features and smart, nice users than a moreadvanced one whose users were idiots ortrolls.So the most important thing a community site can do is attract thekind of people it wants.  A site trying to be as big as possiblewants to attract everyone.  But a site aiming at a particular subsetof users has to attract just those—and just as importantly,repel everyone else.  I\\'ve made a conscious effort to do this onHN.  The graphic design is as plain as possible, and the site rulesdiscourage dramatic link titles.  The goal is that the only thingto interest someone arriving at HN for the first time should be theideas expressed there.The downside of tuning a site to attract certain people is that,to those people, it can be too attractive.  I\\'m all too aware howaddictive Hacker News can be.  For me, as for many users, it\\'s akind of virtual town square.  When I want to take a break fromworking, I walk into the square, just as I might into Harvard Squareor University Ave in the physical world.But an online square ismore dangerous than a physical one.  If I spent half the day loiteringon University Ave, I\\'d notice.  I have to walk a mile to get there,and sitting in a cafe feels different from working. But visitingan online forum takes just a click, and feels superficially verymuch like working.  You may be wasting your time, but you\\'re notidle.  Someone iswrongon the Internet, and you\\'re fixing theproblem.Hacker News is definitely useful.  I\\'ve learned a lot from thingsI\\'ve read on HN.  I\\'ve written several essays that began as commentsthere.  So I wouldn\\'t want the site to go away.  But I would liketo be sure it\\'s not a net drag on productivity.  What a disasterthat would be, to attract thousands of smart people to a site thatcaused them to waste lots of time.  I wish I could be 100% surethat\\'s not a description of HN.I feel like the addictiveness of games and social applications isstill a mostly unsolved problem.  The situation now is like it waswith crack in the 1980s: we\\'ve invented terribly addictive newthings, and we haven\\'t yet evolved ways to protect ourselves fromthem.  We will eventually, and that\\'s one of the problems I hopeto focus on next.'},\n",

       "  'date': 'January 2016',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'Since the 1970s, economic inequality in the US has increaseddramatically. And in particular, the rich have gotten a lot richer.Nearly everyone who writes about the topic says that economic inequalityshould be decreased.I\\'m interested in this question because I was one of the founders ofa company called Y Combinator that helps people start startups.Almost by definition, if a startup succeeds, its founders becomerich. Which means by helping startup founders I\\'ve been helping toincrease economic inequality.  If economic inequality should be decreased, I shouldn\\'t be helping founders. No one shouldbe.But that doesn\\'t sound right. What\\'s going on here? What\\'s goingon is that while economic inequality is a single measure (or moreprecisely, two: variation in income, and variation in wealth), ithas multiple causes. Many of these causes are bad, like tax loopholesand drug addiction. But some are good, like Larry Page andSergey Brin starting the company you use to find things online.If you want to understand economic inequality — and more importantly,if you actually want to fix the bad aspects of it — you have totease apart the components.  And yet the trend in nearly everythingwritten about the subject is to do the opposite: to squash togetherall the aspects of economic inequality as if it were a singlephenomenon.Sometimes this is done for ideological reasons.  Sometimes it\\'sbecause the writer only has very high-level data and so drawsconclusions from that, like the proverbial drunk who looks for hiskeys under the lamppost, instead of where he dropped them, because thelight is better there.  Sometimes it\\'s because the writer doesn\\'tunderstand critical aspects of inequality, like the role of technologyin wealth creation.  Much of the time, perhaps most of the time,writing about economic inequality combines all three.___The most common mistake people make about economic inequality isto treat it as a single phenomenon.  The most naive version of whichis the one based on the pie fallacy: that the rich get rich bytaking money from the poor.Usually this is an assumption people start from rather than aconclusion they arrive at by examining the evidence.  Sometimes thepie fallacy is stated explicitly:...those at the top are grabbing an increasing fraction of the  nation\\'s income — so much of a larger share that what\\'s left over  for the rest is diminished....Other times it\\'s more unconscious. But the unconscious form is verywidespread.  I think because we grow up in a world where the piefallacy is actually true.  To kids, wealthisa fixed piethat\\'s shared out, and if one person gets more, it\\'s at the expenseof another.  It takes a conscious effort to remind oneself that thereal world doesn\\'t work that way.In the real world you can create wealth as well as taking it fromothers.  A woodworker creates wealth.  He makes a chair, and youwillingly give him money in return for it.  A high-frequency traderdoes not.  He makes a dollar only when someone on the other end ofa trade loses a dollar.If the rich people in a society got that way by taking wealth fromthe poor, then you have the degenerate case of economic inequality,where the cause of poverty is the same as the cause of wealth.  Butinstances of inequality don\\'t have to be instances of the degeneratecase.  If one woodworker makes 5 chairs and another makes none, thesecond woodworker will have less money, but not because anyone tookanything from him.Even people sophisticated enough to know about the pie fallacy areled toward it by the custom of describing economic inequality as aratio of one quantile\\'s income or wealth to another\\'s.  It\\'s soeasy to slip from talking about income shifting from one quantileto another, as a figure of speech, into believing that is literallywhat\\'s happening.Except in the degenerate case, economic inequality can\\'t be describedby a ratio or even a curve.  In the general case it consists ofmultiple ways people become poor, and multiple ways people becomerich.  Which means to understand economic inequality in a country,you have to go find individual people who are poor or rich andfigure out why.If you want to understandchangein economic inequality, youshould ask what those people would have done when it was different.This is one way I know the rich aren\\'t all getting richer simplyfrom some new system for transferring wealth to them fromeveryone else.  When you use the would-have method with startupfounders, you find what most would have doneback in 1960, wheneconomic inequality was lower, was to join big companies or becomeprofessors.  Before Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook, his defaultexpectation was that he\\'d end up working at Microsoft.  The reasonhe and most other startup founders are richer than they would havebeen in the mid 20th century is not because of some right turn thecountry took during the Reagan administration, but because progressin technology has made it much easier to start a new company thatgrows fast.Traditional economists seem strangely averse to studying individualhumans. It seems to be a rule with them that everything has to startwith statistics.  So they give you very precise numbers aboutvariation in wealth and income, then follow it with the most naivespeculation about the underlying causes.But while there are a lot of people who get rich through rent-seekingof various forms, and a lot who get rich by playing zero-sum games, there are also a significant numberwho get rich by creating wealth.  And creating wealth, as a sourceof economic inequality, is different from taking it — not justmorally, but also practically, in the sense that it is harder toeradicate.  One reason is that variation in productivity isaccelerating.  The rate at which individuals can create wealthdepends on the technology available to them, and that growsexponentially. The other reason creating wealth is such a tenacioussource of inequality is that it can expand to accommodate a lot ofpeople.___I\\'m all for shutting down the crooked ways to get rich.  But thatwon\\'t eliminate great variations in wealth, because as long as you leaveopen the option of getting rich by creating wealth, people who wantto get rich will do that instead.Most people who get rich tend to be fairly driven. Whatever theirother flaws, laziness is usually not one of them.  Suppose newpolicies make it hard to make a fortune in finance. Does it seemplausible that the people who currently go into finance to maketheir fortunes will continue to do so, but be content to work forordinary salaries? The reason they go into finance is not becausethey love finance but because they want to get rich. If the onlyway left to get rich is to start startups, they\\'ll start startups.They\\'ll do well at it too, because determination is the main factorin the success of a startup.And while it would probably bea good thing for the world if people who wanted to get rich switchedfrom playing zero-sum games to creating wealth, that would not onlynot eliminate great variations in wealth, but might even exacerbate them.In a zero-sum game there is at least a limit to the upside.  Plusa lot of the new startups would create new technology that furtheraccelerated variation in productivity.Variation in productivity is far from the only source of economicinequality, but it is the irreducible core of it, in the sense thatyou\\'ll have that left when you eliminate all other sources. And ifyou do, that core will be big, because it will have expanded toinclude the efforts of all the refugees.  Plus it will have a largeBaumol penumbra around it: anyone who could get rich by creatingwealth on their own account will have to be paid enough to preventthem from doing it.You can\\'t prevent great variations in wealth without preventing peoplefrom getting rich, and you can\\'t do that without preventing themfrom starting startups.So let\\'s be clear about that. Eliminating great variations in wealth wouldmean eliminating startups.  And that doesn\\'t seem a wise move.Especially since it would only mean you eliminatedstartups in your own country.  Ambitious people already move halfwayaround the world to further their careers, and startups can operatefrom anywhere nowadays.  So if you made it impossible to get richby creating wealth in your country, people who wanted to do thatwould just leave and do it somewhere else. Which wouldcertainly get you a lower Gini coefficient, along with a lesson inbeing careful what you ask for.I think rising economic inequality is the inevitable fate of countriesthat don\\'t choose something worse. We had a 40 year stretch in themiddle of the 20th century that convinced some people otherwise.But as I explained inThe Refragmentation,that was an anomaly — aunique combination of circumstances that compressed American societynot just economically but culturally too.And while some of the growth in economic inequality we\\'ve seen sincethen has been due to bad behavior of various kinds, there hassimultaneously been a huge increase in individuals\\' ability tocreate wealth.  Startups are almost entirely a product of thisperiod. And even within the startup world, there has been a qualitativechange in the last 10 years.  Technology has decreased the cost ofstarting a startup so much that founders now have the upper handover investors.  Founders get less diluted, and it is now commonfor them to retainboard controlas well.  Both further increaseeconomic inequality, the former because founders own more stock,and the latter because, as investors have learned, founders tendto be better at running their companies than investors.While the surface manifestations change, the underlying forces arevery, very old.  The acceleration of productivity we see in SiliconValley has been happening for thousands of years.  If you look atthe history of stone tools, technology was already accelerating inthe Mesolithic.  The acceleration would have been too slow toperceive in one lifetime.  Such is the nature of the leftmost partof an exponential curve.  But it was the same curve.You do not want to design your society in a way that\\'s incompatiblewith this curve. The evolution of technology is one of the mostpowerful forces in history.Louis Brandeis said \"We may have democracy, or we may have wealthconcentrated in the hands of a few, but we can\\'t have both.\" Thatsounds plausible.  But if I have to choose between ignoring him andignoring an exponential curve that has been operating for thousandsof years, I\\'ll bet on the curve.  Ignoring any trend that has beenoperating for thousands of years is dangerous.  But exponentialgrowth, especially, tends to bite you.___If accelerating variation in productivity is always going to producesome baseline growth in economic inequality, it would be a goodidea to spend some time thinking about that future.  Can you havea healthy society with great variation in wealth?  What would itlook like?Notice how novel it feels to think about that.  The public conversationso far has been exclusively about the need to decrease economicinequality.  We\\'ve barely given a thought to how to live with it.I\\'m hopeful we\\'ll be able to.  Brandeis was a product of the GildedAge, and things have changed since then. It\\'s harder to hidewrongdoing now.  And to get rich now you don\\'t have to buy politiciansthe way railroad or oil magnates did.The great concentrationsof wealth I see around me in Silicon Valley don\\'t seem to bedestroying democracy.There are lots of things wrong with the US that have economicinequality as a symptom. We should fix those things.  In the processwe may decrease economic inequality. But we can\\'t start from thesymptom and hope to fix the underlying causes.The most obvious is poverty. I\\'m sure most of those who want todecrease economic inequality want to do it mainly to help the poor,not to hurt the rich.Indeed, a good number are merely beingsloppy by speaking of decreasing economic inequality when what theymean is decreasing poverty.  But this is a situation where it wouldbe good to be precise about what we want.  Poverty and economicinequality are not identical.  When the city is turning off yourwaterbecause you can\\'t pay the bill, it doesn\\'t make any differencewhat Larry Page\\'s net worth is compared to yours.  He might onlybe a few times richer than you, and it would still be just as muchof a problem that your water was getting turned off.Closely related to poverty is lack of social mobility.  I\\'ve seenthis myself: you don\\'t have to grow up rich or even upper middleclass to get rich as a startup founder, but few successful foundersgrew up desperately poor.  But again, the problem here is not simplyeconomic inequality.  There is an enormous difference in wealthbetween the household Larry Page grew up in and that of a successfulstartup founder, but that didn\\'t prevent him from joining theirranks.  It\\'s not economic inequality per se that\\'s blocking socialmobility, but some specific combination of things that go wrongwhen kids grow up sufficiently poor.One of the most important principles in Silicon Valley is that \"youmake what you measure.\"  It means that if you pick some number tofocus on, it will tend to improve, but that you have to choose theright number, because only the one you choose will improve; anotherthat seems conceptually adjacent might not.  For example, if you\\'rea university president and you decide to focus on graduation rates,then you\\'ll improve graduation rates.  But only graduation rates,not how much students learn.  Students could learn less, if toimprove graduation rates you made classes easier.Economic inequality is sufficiently far from identical with thevarious problems that have it as a symptom that we\\'ll probably onlyhit whichever of the two we aim at.  If we aim at economic inequality,we won\\'t fix these problems.  So I say let\\'s aim at the problems.For example, let\\'s attack poverty, and if necessary damage wealthin the process. That\\'s much more likely to work than attackingwealth in the hope that you will thereby fix poverty.And ifthere are people getting rich by tricking consumers or lobbying thegovernment for anti-competitive regulations or tax loopholes, thenlet\\'s stop them. Not because it\\'s causing economic inequality, butbecause it\\'s stealing.If all you have is statistics, it seems like that\\'s what you needto fix. But behind a broad statistical measure like economicinequality there are some things that are good and some that arebad, some that are historical trends with immense momentum andothers that are random accidents.  If we want to fix the worldbehind the statistics, we have to understand it, and focus ourefforts where they\\'ll do the most good.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': \"I've discovered a handy test for figuring out what you're addictedto.  Imagine you were going to spend the weekend at a friend's houseon a little island off the coast of Maine.  There are no shops onthe island and you won't be able to leave while you're there.  Also,you've never been to this house before, so you can't assume it willhave more than any house might.What, besides clothes and toiletries, do you make a point of packing?That's what you're addicted to.  For example, if you find yourselfpacking a bottle of vodka (just in case), you may want to stop andthink about that.For me the list is four things: books, earplugs, a notebook, and apen.There are other things I might bring if I thought of it, like music,or tea, but I can live without them.  I'm not so addicted to caffeinethat I wouldn't risk the house not having any tea, just for aweekend.Quiet is another matter.  I realize it seems a bit eccentric totake earplugs on a trip to an island off the coast of Maine.  Ifanywhere should be quiet, that should.  But what if the person inthe next room snored?  What if there was a kid playing basketball?(Thump, thump, thump... thump.)  Why risk it?  Earplugs are small.Sometimes I can think with noise.  If I already have momentum onsome project, I can work in noisy places.  I can edit an essay ordebug code in an airport.  But airports are not so bad: most of thenoise is whitish.  I couldn't work with the sound of a sitcom comingthrough the wall, or a car in the street playing thump-thump music.And of course there's another kind of thinking, when you're startingsomething new, that requires complete quiet.   You neverknow when this will strike. It's just as well to carry plugs.The notebook and pen are professional equipment, as it were.  Thoughactually there is something druglike about them, in the sense thattheir main purpose is to make me feel better.  I hardly ever goback and read stuff I write down in notebooks.  It's just that ifI can't write things down, worrying about remembering one idea getsin the way of having the next.  Pen and paper wick ideas.The best notebooks I've found are made by a company called Miquelrius.I use their smallest size, which is about 2.5 x 4 in.The secret to writing on suchnarrow pages is to break words only when you run out of space, likea Latin inscription.  I use the cheapest plastic Bic ballpoints,partly because their gluey ink doesn't seep through pages, andpartly so I don't worry about losing them.I only started carrying a notebook about three years ago.  Beforethat I used whatever scraps of paper I could find.  But the problemwith scraps of paper is that they're not ordered.  In a notebookyou can guess what a scribble means by looking at the pagesaround it.  In the scrap era I was constantly finding notes I'dwritten years before that might say something I needed to remember,if I could only figure out what.As for books, I know the house would probably have something toread.  On the average trip I bring four books and only read one ofthem, because I find new books to read en route.  Really bringingbooks is insurance.I realize this dependence on books is not entirely good—that whatI need them for is distraction.  The books I bring on trips areoften quite virtuous, the sort of stuff that might be assignedreading in a college class.  But I know my motives aren't virtuous.I bring books because if the world gets boring I need to be ableto slip into another distilled by some writer.  It's like eatingjam when you know you should be eating fruit.There is a point where I'll do without books.  I was walking insome steep mountains once, and decided I'd rather just think, if Iwas bored, rather than carry a single unnecessary ounce.  It wasn'tso bad.  I found I could entertain myself by having ideas insteadof reading other people's.  If you stop eating jam, fruit startsto taste better.So maybe I'll try not bringing books on some future trip.  They'regoing to have to pry the plugs out of my cold, dead ears, however.Spanish TranslationJapanese Translation\"},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Most people think of nerds as quiet, diffident people. In ordinarysocial situations they are — as quiet and diffident as the starquarterback would be if he found himself in the middle of a physicssymposium. And for the same reason: they are fish out of water.But the apparent diffidence of nerds is an illusion due to the factthat when non-nerds observe them, it\\'s usually in ordinary socialsituations. In fact some nerds are quite fierce.The fierce nerds are a small but interesting group. They are as arule extremely competitive — more competitive, I\\'d say, than highlycompetitive non-nerds. Competition is more personal for them. Partlyperhaps because they\\'re not emotionally mature enough to distancethemselves from it, but also because there\\'s less randomness in thekinds of competition they engage in, and they are thus more justifiedin taking the results personally.Fierce nerds also tend to be somewhat overconfident, especiallywhen young. It might seem like it would be a disadvantage to bemistaken about one\\'s abilities, but empirically it isn\\'t. Up to apoint, confidence is a self-fullfilling prophecy.Another quality you find in most fierce nerds is intelligence. Notall nerds are smart, but the fierce ones are always at leastmoderately so. If they weren\\'t, they wouldn\\'t have the confidenceto be fierce.There\\'s also a natural connection between nerdiness andindependent-mindedness. It\\'s hard to be independent-minded withoutbeing somewhat socially awkward, because conventional beliefs areso often mistaken, or at least arbitrary. No one who was bothindependent-minded and ambitious would want to waste the effort ittakes to fit in. And the independent-mindedness of the fierce nerdswill obviously be of theaggressiverather than the passive type:they\\'ll be annoyed by rules, rather than dreamily unaware of them.I\\'m less sure why fierce nerds are impatient, but most seem to be.You notice it first in conversation, where they tend to interruptyou. This is merely annoying, but in the more promising fierce nerdsit\\'s connected to a deeper impatience about solving problems. Perhapsthe competitiveness and impatience of fierce nerds are not separate qualities, but two manifestations of a single underlying drivenness.When you combine all these qualities in sufficient quantities, theresult is quite formidable. The most vivid example of fierce nerdsin action may be James Watson\\'sThe Double Helix. The first sentenceof the book is \"I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood,\"and the portrait he goes on to paint of Crick is the quintessentialfierce nerd: brilliant, socially awkward, competitive, independent-minded,overconfident. But so is the implicit portrait he paints of himself.Indeed, his lack of social awareness makes both portraits that muchmore realistic, because he baldly states all sorts of opinions andmotivations that a smoother person would conceal. And moreover it\\'sclear from the story that Crick and Watson\\'s fierce nerdiness wasintegral to their success. Their independent-mindedness caused themto consider approaches that most others ignored, their overconfidenceallowed them to work on problems they only half understood (theywere literally described as \"clowns\" by one eminent insider), andtheir impatience and competitiveness got them to the answer aheadof two other groups that would otherwise have found it within thenext year, if not the next several months.The idea that there could be fierce nerds is an unfamiliar one notjust to many normal people but even to some young nerds. Especiallyearly on, nerds spend so much of their time in ordinary socialsituations and so little doing real work that they get a lot moreevidence of their awkwardness than their power. So there will besome who read this description of the fierce nerd and realize \"Hmm,that\\'s me.\" And it is to you, young fierce nerd, that I now turn.I have some good news, and some bad news. The good news is thatyour fierceness will be a great help in solving difficult problems.And not just the kind of scientific and technical problems thatnerds have traditionally solved. As the world progresses, the numberof things you can win at by getting the right answer increases.Recentlygetting richbecame one of them: 7 of the 8 richest peoplein America are now fierce nerds.Indeed, being a fierce nerd is probably even more helpful in businessthan in nerds\\' original territory of scholarship. Fierceness seemsoptional there. Darwin for example doesn\\'t seem to have beenespecially fierce. Whereas it\\'s impossible to be the CEO of a companyover a certain size without being fierce, so now that nerds can winat business, fierce nerds will increasingly monopolize the reallybig successes.The bad news is that if it\\'s not exercised, your fierceness willturn to bitterness, and you will become an intellectual playgroundbully: the grumpy sysadmin, the forum troll, thehater, the shooterdown ofnew ideas.How do you avoid this fate? Work on ambitious projects. If yousucceed, it will bring you a kind of satisfaction that neutralizesbitterness. But you don\\'t need to have succeeded to feel this;merely working on hard projects gives most fierce nerds somefeeling of satisfaction. And those it doesn\\'t, it at least keepsbusy.Another solution may be to somehow turn off your fierceness, bydevoting yourself to meditation or psychotherapy or something likethat. Maybe that\\'s the right answer for some people. I have no idea.But it doesn\\'t seem the optimal solution to me. If you\\'re given asharp knife, it seems to me better to use it than to blunt its edgeto avoid cutting yourself.If you do choose the ambitious route, you\\'ll have a tailwind behindyou. There has never been a better time to be a nerd. In the pastcentury we\\'ve seen a continuous transfer of power from dealmakersto technicians — from the charismatic to the competent — and Idon\\'t see anything on the horizon that will end it.

       "  'date': 'Want to start a startup?',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.August 2008Raising money is the second hardest part of starting a startup.The hardest part is making something people want: most startupsthat die, die because they didn\\'t do that.  But the second biggestcause of death is probably the difficulty of raising money.Fundraising is brutal.One reason it\\'s so brutal is simply the brutality of markets.  Peoplewho\\'ve spent most of their lives in schools or big companies maynot have been exposed to that.  Professors and bosses usually feelsome sense of responsibility toward you; if you make a valianteffort and fail, they\\'ll cut you a break.  Markets are less forgiving.Customers don\\'t care how hard you worked, only whether you solvedtheir problems.Investors evaluate startups the way customers evaluate products,not the way bosses evaluate employees.  If you\\'re making a valianteffort and failing, maybe they\\'ll invest in your next startup, butnot this one.But raising money from investors is harder than selling tocustomers, because there are so few of them.  There\\'snothing like an efficient market.  You\\'re unlikely to have morethan 10 who are interested; it\\'s difficult to talk to more.  So therandomness of any one investor\\'s behavior can really affect you.Problem number 3: investors are very random.  All investors, includingus, are by ordinary standards incompetent.  We constantly have tomake decisions about things we don\\'t understand, and more oftenthan not we\\'re wrong.And yet a lot is at stake.  The amounts invested by different typesof investors vary from five thousand dollars to fifty million, butthe amount usually seems large for whatever type of investor it is.Investment decisions are big decisions.That combination—making big decisions about things they don\\'tunderstand—tends to make investors very skittish.  VCs are notoriousfor leading founders on.  Some of the more unscrupulous do itdeliberately.  But even the most well-intentioned investors canbehave in a way that would seem crazy in everyday life.  One daythey\\'re full of enthusiasm and seem ready to write you a check onthe spot; the next they won\\'t return your phone calls.  They\\'re notplaying games with you.  They just can\\'t make up their minds.If that weren\\'t bad enough, these wildly fluctuating nodes are alllinked together.  Startup investors all know one another, and (thoughthey hate to admit it) the biggest factor in their opinion of youis the opinion of other investors.Talk about a recipe foran unstable system.  You get the opposite of the damping that thefear/greed balance usually produces in markets.  No one is interestedin a startup that\\'s a \"bargain\" because everyone else hates it.So the inefficient market you get because there are so few playersis exacerbated by the fact that they act less than independently.The result is a system like some kind of primitive, multi-celledsea creature, where you irritate one extremity and the whole thingcontracts violently.Y Combinator is working to fix this.  We\\'re trying to increase thenumber of investors just as we\\'re increasing the number of startups.We hope that as the number of both increases we\\'ll get somethingmore like an efficient market.  As t approaches infinity, Demo Dayapproaches an auction.Unfortunately, t is still very far from infinity.  What does astartup do now, in the imperfect world we currently inhabit? Themost important thing is not to let fundraising get you down.  Startupslive or die on morale.  If you let the difficulty of raising moneydestroy your morale, it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.Bootstrapping (= Consulting)Some would-be founders may by now be thinking, why deal with investorsat all?  If raising money is so painful, why do it?One answer to that is obvious: because you need money to live on.It\\'s a fine idea in principle to finance your startup with its ownrevenues, but you can\\'t create instant customers.  Whatever youmake, you have to sell a certain amount to break even.  It willtake time to grow your sales to that point, and it\\'s hard to predict,till you try, how long it will take.We could not have bootstrapped Viaweb, for example.  We chargedquite a lot for our software—about $140 per user per month—butit was at least a year before our revenues would have covered evenour paltry costs.  We didn\\'t have enough saved to live on for ayear.If you factor out the \"bootstrapped\" companies that were actuallyfunded by their founders through savings or a day job, the remaindereither (a) got really lucky, which is hard to do on demand, or (b)began life as consulting companies and gradually transformedthemselves into product companies.Consulting is the only option you can count on.  But consulting isfar from free money.  It\\'s not as painful as raising money frominvestors, perhaps, but the pain is spread over a longer period.Years, probably.  And for many types of startup, that delay couldbe fatal.  If you\\'re working on something so unusual that no oneelse is likely to think of it, you can take your time.  JoshuaSchachter gradually built Delicious on the side while working onWall Street.  He got away with it because no one else realized itwas a good idea.  But if you were building something as obviouslynecessary as online store software at about the same time as Viaweb,and you were working on it on the side while spending most of yourtime on client work, you were not in a good position.Bootstrapping sounds great in principle, but this apparently verdantterritory is one from which few startups emerge alive.  The merefact that bootstrapped startups tend to be famous on that accountshould set off alarm bells.  If it worked so well, it would be thenorm.Bootstrapping may get easier, because starting a company is gettingcheaper.  But I don\\'t think we\\'ll ever reach the point where moststartups can do without outside funding.  Technology tends toget dramatically cheaper, but living expenses don\\'t.The upshot is, you can choose your pain: either the short, sharppain of raising money, or the chronic ache of consulting.  For agiven total amount of pain, raising money is the better choice,because new technology is usually more valuable now than later.But although for most startups raising money will be the lesserevil, it\\'s still a pretty big evil—so big that it can easily killyou.  Not merely in the obvious sense that if you fail to raisemoney you might have to shut the company down, but because theprocessof raising money itself can kill you.To survive it you need a set of techniques mostlyorthogonal to the ones used in convincing investors, just as mountainclimbers need to know survival techniques that are mostly orthogonalto those used in physically getting up and down mountains.1. Have low expectations.The reason raising money destroys so many startups\\' morale is notsimply that it\\'s hard, but that it\\'s so much harder than theyexpected.  What kills you is the disappointment.  And the loweryour expectations, the harder it is to be disappointed.Startup founders tend to be optimistic.  This can work well intechnology, at least some of the time, but it\\'s the wrong way toapproach raising money.  Better to assume investors will always letyou down.  Acquirers too, while we\\'re at it.  At YC one of oursecondary mantras is \"Deals fall through.\"  No matter what dealyou have going on, assume it will fall through.  The predictivepower of this simple rule is amazing.There will be a tendency, as a deal progresses, to start to believeit will happen, and then to depend on it happening.  You must resistthis.  Tie yourself to the mast.  This is what kills you.  Dealsdo not have a trajectory like most other human interactions, whereshared plans solidify linearly over time.  Deals often fall throughat the last moment.  Often the other party doesn\\'t really thinkabout what they want till the last moment.  So you can\\'t use youreveryday intuitions about shared plans as a guide.  When it comesto deals, you have to consciously turn them off and becomepathologically cynical.This is harder to do than it sounds.  It\\'s very flattering wheneminent investors seem interested in funding you.  It\\'s easy tostart to believe that raising money will be quick and straightforward.But it hardly ever is.2. Keep working on your startup.It sounds obvious to say that you should keep working on your startupwhile raising money.  Actually this is hard to do.  Most startupsdon\\'t manage to.Raising money has a mysterious capacity to suck up all your attention.Even if you only have one meeting a day with investors, somehowthat one meeting will burn up your whole day.  It costs not justthe time of the actual meeting, but the time getting there and back,and the time preparing for it beforehand and thinking about itafterward.The best way to survive the distraction of meeting with investorsis probably to partition the company: to pick one founder to dealwith investors while the others keep the company going.  This worksbetter when a startup has 3 founders than 2, and better when theleader of the company is not also the lead developer.  In the bestcase, the company keeps moving forward at about half speed.That\\'s the best case, though.  More often than not the company comesto a standstill while raising money.  And that is dangerous for somany reasons.  Raising money always takes longer than you expect.What seems like it\\'s going to be a 2 week interruption turns intoa 4 month interruption.  That can be very demoralizing.  And worsestill, it can make you less attractive to investors.  They want toinvest in companies that are dynamic.  A company that hasn\\'t doneanything new in 4 months doesn\\'t seem dynamic, so they start tolose interest.  Investors rarely grasp this, but much of whatthey\\'re responding to when they lose interest in a startup is thedamage done by their own indecision.The solution: put the startup first.  Fit meetings with investorsinto the spare moments in your development schedule, rather thandoing development in the spare moments between meetings withinvestors.  If you keep the company moving forward—releasing newfeatures, increasing traffic, doing deals, getting written about—those investor meetings are more likely to be productive.  Not justbecause your startup will seem more alive, but also because it willbe better for your own morale, which is one of the main ways investorsjudge you.3. Be conservative.As conditions get worse, the optimal strategy becomes more conservative.When things go well you can take risks; when things are bad youwant to play it safe.I advise approaching fundraising as if it were always going badly.The reason is that between your ability to delude yourself and thewildly unstable nature of the system you\\'re dealing with, thingsprobably either already are or could easily become much worse thanthey seem.What I tell most startups we fund is that if someone reputableoffers you funding on reasonable terms, take it.  There have beenstartups that ignored this advice and got away with it—startupsthat ignored a good offer in the hope of getting a better one, andactually did.  But in the same position I\\'d give the same adviceagain.  Who knows how many bullets were in the gun they were playingRussian roulette with?Corollary: if an investor seems interested, don\\'t just let themsit. You can\\'t assume someone interested in investing will stayinterested.  In fact, you can\\'t even tell (theycan\\'t even tell)if they\\'re really interested till you try to convert that interestinto money.  So if you have hot prospect, either close them now orwrite them off.  And unless you already have enough funding, thatreduces to: close them now.Startups don\\'t win by getting great funding rounds, but by makinggreat products.  So finish raising money and getback to work.4. Be flexible.There are two questions VCs ask that you shouldn\\'t answer: \"Whoelse are you talking to?\" and \"How much are you trying to raise?\"VCs don\\'t expect you to answer the first question. They ask it justin case.They do seem to expect an answer to the second.  ButI don\\'t think you should just tell them a number.  Not as a way toplay games with them, but because you shouldn\\'thavea fixedamount you need to raise.The custom of a startup needing a fixed amount of funding is anobsolete one left over from the days when startups were moreexpensive.  A company that needed to build a factory or hire 50people obviously needed to raise a certain minimum amount.  But fewtechnology startups are in that position today.We advise startups to tell investors there are several differentroutes they could take depending on how much they raised.  As littleas $50k could pay for food and rent for the founders for a year.A couple hundred thousand would let them get office space and hiresome smart people they know from school.  A couple million wouldlet them really blow this thing out.  The message (and not just themessage, but the fact) should be: we\\'re going to succeed no matterwhat.  Raising more money just lets us do it faster.If you\\'re raising an angel round, the size of the round can evenchange on the fly.  In fact, it\\'s just as well to make the roundsmall initially, then expand as needed, rather than trying to raisea large round and risk losing the investors you already have if youcan\\'t raise the full amount.  You may even want to do a \"rollingclose,\" where the round has no predetermined size, but instead yousell stock to investors one at a time as they say yes.  That helpsbreak deadlocks, because you can start as soon as the first oneis ready to buy.5. Be independent.A startup with a couple founders in their early twenties can haveexpenses so low that they could be profitable onas little as $2000 per month.  That\\'s negligible as corporaterevenues go, but the effect on your morale and your bargainingposition is anything but.  At YC we use the phrase \"ramen profitable\"to describe the situation where you\\'re making just enough to payyour living expenses.  Once you cross into ramen profitable,everything changes.  You may still need investment to make it big,but you don\\'t need it this month.You can\\'t plan when you start a startup how longit will take to become profitable.  But if you find yourself in aposition where a little more effort expended on sales would carryyou over the threshold of ramen profitable, do it.Investors like it when you\\'re ramen profitable.  It shows you\\'vethought about making money, instead of just working on amusingtechnical problems; it shows you have the discipline to keep yourexpenses low; but above all, it means you don\\'t need them.There is nothing investors like more than a startup that seems likeit\\'s going to succeed even without them.  Investors like it whenthey can help a startup, but they don\\'t like startups that woulddie without that help.At YC we spend a lot of time trying to predict how the startups we\\'vefunded will do, because we\\'re trying to learn how to pick winners.We\\'ve now watched the trajectories of so many startups that we\\'regetting better at predicting them.  And when we\\'re talkingabout startups we think are likely to succeed, what we find ourselvessaying is things like \"Oh, those guys can take care of themselves.They\\'ll be fine.\" Not \"those guys are really smart\" or\"those guys are working on a great idea.\"When we predict good outcomes for startups, the qualitiesthat come up in the supporting arguments are toughness, adaptability,determination.  Which means to the extent we\\'re correct, those arethe qualities you need to win.Investors know this, at least unconsciously.   The reason they likeit when you don\\'t need them is not simply that they like what theycan\\'t have, but because that quality is what makes founders succeed.Sam Altmanhas it.  You could parachute him into an island full ofcannibals and come back in 5 years and he\\'d be the king.  If you\\'reSam Altman, you don\\'t have to be profitable to convey to investorsthat you\\'ll succeed with or without them.  (He wasn\\'t, and he did.)Not everyone has Sam\\'s deal-making ability.  I myself don\\'t.  Butif you don\\'t, you can let the numbers speak for you.6. Don\\'t take rejection personally.Getting rejected by investors can make you start to doubt yourself.After all, they\\'re more experienced than you.  If they think yourstartup is lame, aren\\'t they probably right?Maybe, maybe not.  The way to handle rejection is with precision.You shouldn\\'t simply ignore rejection.  It might mean something.But you shouldn\\'t automatically get demoralized either.To understand what rejection means, you have to understand firstof all how common it is.  Statistically, the average VC is a rejectionmachine.  David Hornik, a partner at August, told me:The numbers for me ended up being something like 500 to 800 plans  received and read, somewhere between 50 and 100 initial 1 hour  meetings held, about 20 companies that I got interested in, about  5 that I got serious about and did a bunch of work, 1 to 2 deals  done in a year.  So the odds are against you.  You  may be a great entrepreneur, working on interesting stuff, etc.  but it is still incredibly unlikely that you get funded.This is less true with angels, but VCs reject practically everyone.The structure of their business means a partner does at most 2 newinvestments a year, no matter how many good startups approach him.In addition to the odds being terrible, the average investor is,as I mentioned, a pretty bad judge of startups.  It\\'s harder tojudge startups than most other things, because great startup ideastend to seem wrong. A good startup idea has to be not just good butnovel.  And to be both good and novel, an idea probably has to seembad to most people, or someone would already be doing it and itwouldn\\'t be novel.That makes judging startups harder than most other things one judges.You have to be an intellectual contrarian to be a good startupinvestor.  That\\'s a problem for VCs, most of whom are not particularlyimaginative.  VCs are mostly money guys, not people who make things.Angels are better at appreciating novel ideas, because mostwere founders themselves.So when you get a rejection, use the data that\\'s in it, and not what\\'snot.  If an investor gives you specific reasons for not investing,look at your startup and ask if they\\'re right.  If they\\'re realproblems, fix them.  But don\\'t just take their word for it.  You\\'resupposed to be the domain expert; you have to decide.Though a rejection doesn\\'t necessarily tell you anything about yourstartup, it does suggest your pitch could be improved.  Figure outwhat\\'s not working and change it.  Don\\'t just think \"investors arestupid.\"  Often they are, but figure out precisely where you losethem.Don\\'t let rejections pile up as a depressing, undifferentiated heap.Sort them and analyze them, and then instead of thinking \"no onelikes us,\" you\\'ll know precisely how big a problem you have, andwhat to do about it.7. Be able to downshift into consulting (if appropriate).Consulting, as I mentioned, is a dangerous way to finance a startup.But it\\'s better than dying.  It\\'s a bit like anaerobic respiration:not the optimum solution for the long term, but it can save youfrom an immediate threat.  If you\\'re having trouble raising moneyfrom investors at all, it could save you to be able to shifttoward consulting.This works better for some startups than others.  It wouldn\\'t havebeen a natural fit for, say, Google, but if your company was makingsoftware for building web sites, you could degrade fairly gracefullyinto consulting by building sites for clients with it.So long as you were careful not to get sucked permanently intoconsulting, this could even have advantages.  You\\'d understand yourusers well if you were using the software for them.  Plus as aconsulting company you might be able to get big-name users usingyour software that you wouldn\\'t have gotten as a product company.At Viaweb we were forced to operate like a consulting companyinitially, because we were so desperate for users that we\\'d offerto build merchants\\' sites for them if they\\'d sign up. But we never charged for such work, because we didn\\'t want them tostart treating us like actual consultants, and calling us everytime they wanted something changed on their site.  We knew we hadto stay a product company, because onlythat scales.8. Avoid inexperienced investors.Though novice investors seem unthreatening they can be the mostdangerous sort, because they\\'re so nervous.  Especially inproportion to the amount they invest.  Raising $20,000 from a first-timeangel investor can be as much work as raising $2 million froma VC fund.Their lawyers are generally inexperienced too.  But while theinvestors can admit they don\\'t know what they\\'re doing, their lawyerscan\\'t.  One YC startup negotiated terms for a tiny round withan angel, only to receive a 70-page agreement from his lawyer.  Andsince the lawyer could never admit, in front of his client, thathe\\'d screwed up, he instead had to insist on retaining all thedraconian terms in it, so the deal fell through.Of course, someone has to take money from novice investors, or therewould never be any experienced ones.  But if you do, either (a)drive the process yourself, including supplying thepaperwork, or(b) use them only to fill up a larger round led by someone else.9. Know where you stand.The most dangerous thing about investors is their indecisiveness.The worst case scenario is the long no, the no that comes aftermonths of meetings.  Rejections from investors are like designflaws: inevitable, but much less costly if you discover them early.So while you\\'re talking to investors, constantly look for signs ofwhere you stand.  How likely are they to offer you a term sheet?What do they have to be convinced of first?  You shouldn\\'t necessarilyalways be asking these questions outright—that could get annoying—but you should always be collecting data about them.Investors tend to resist committing except to the extent you pushthem to.  It\\'s in their interest to collect the maximum amount ofinformation while making the minimum number of decisions.  The bestway to force them to act is, of course, competing investors.  Butyou can also apply some force by focusing the discussion:by asking what specific questions they need answered to makeup their minds, and then answering them.  If you get through severalobstacles and they keep raising new ones, assume that ultimatelythey\\'re going to flake.You have to be disciplined when collecting data about investors\\'intentions.  Otherwise their desire to lead you on will combinewith your own desire to be led on to produce completely inaccurateimpressions.Use the data to weight your strategy.You\\'ll probably be talking to several investors.  Focus on the onesthat are most likely to say yes.  The value of a potential investoris a combination of how good it would be if they said yes, and howlikely they are to say it.  Put the most weight on the second factor.Partly because the most important quality in an investor is simplyinvesting.  But also because, as I mentioned, the biggest factorin investors\\' opinion of you is other investors\\' opinion of you.If you\\'re talking to several investors and you manage to get oneover the threshold of saying yes, it will make the others much moreinterested.  So you\\'re not sacrificing the lukewarm investors ifyou focus on the hot ones; convincing the hot investors is the bestway to convince the lukewarm ones.FutureI\\'m hopeful things won\\'t always be so awkward. I hope that as startupsget cheaper and the number of investors increases, raising moneywill become, if not easy, at least straightforward.In the meantime, the brokenness of the funding process offers a bigopportunity.  Most investors have no idea how dangerous they are.They\\'d be surprised to hear that raising money from them is somethingthat has to be treated as a threat to a company\\'s survival.  Theyjust think they need a little more information to make up theirminds.  They don\\'t get that there are 10 other investors who alsowant a little more information, and that the process of talking tothem all can bring a startup to a standstill for months.Because investors don\\'t understand the cost of dealing with them,they don\\'t realize how much room there is for a potential competitorto undercut them.  I know from my own experience how much fasterinvestors could decide, because we\\'ve brought our own time down to20 minutes (5 minutes of reading an application plus a 10 minuteinterview plus 5 minutes of discussion).  If you were investingmore money you\\'d want to take longer, of course.  But if we candecide in 20 minutes, should it take anyone longer than a coupledays?Opportunities like this don\\'t sit unexploited forever, even in anindustry as conservative as venture capital.  Soeither existing investors will start to make up their minds faster,or new investors will emerge who do.In the meantime founders have to treat raising money as a dangerousprocess.  Fortunately, I can fix the biggest danger right here.The biggest danger is surprise.  It\\'s that startups will underestimatethe difficulty of raising money—that they\\'ll cruise through allthe initial steps, but when they turn to raising money they\\'ll findit surprisingly hard, get demoralized, and give up. So I\\'m tellingyou in advance: raising money is hard.'},\n",

       "  'date': 'January 2003',\n",
       "  'essay_text': '(This article was given as a talk at the 2003 Spam Conference.It describes the work I\\'ve done to improve the performance ofthe algorithm described inA Plan for Spam,and what I plan to do in the future.)The first discovery I\\'d like to present here is an algorithm forlazy evaluation of research papers.  Justwrite whatever you want and don\\'t cite any previous work, andindignant readers will send you references to all the papers youshould have cited.   I discovered this algorithmafter ``A Plan for Spam\\'\\' [1] was on Slashdot.Spam filtering is a subset of text classification,which is a well established field, but the first papers aboutBayesianspam filtering per se seem to have been twogiven at the same conference in 1998,one by Pantel and Lin [2],and another by a group fromMicrosoft Research [3].When I heard about this work I was a bit surprised.  Ifpeople had been onto Bayesian filtering four years ago,why wasn\\'t everyone using it?When I read the papers I found out why.  Pantel and Lin\\'s filter was themore effective of the two, but itonly caught 92% of spam, with 1.16% false positives.When I tried writing a Bayesian spam filter,it caught 99.5% of spam with less than .03% falsepositives [4].It\\'s always alarming when two peopletrying the same experiment get widely divergent results.It\\'s especially alarming here because those two sets of numbersmight yield opposite conclusions.Different users have different requirements, but I think formany people a filtering rate of 92% with 1.16% false positives meansthat filtering is not an acceptable solution, whereas99.5% with less than .03% false positives means that it is.So why did we get such different numbers?I haven\\'t tried to reproduce Pantel and Lin\\'s results, butfrom reading the paper I see five things that probably accountfor the difference.One is simply that they trained their filter on very littledata: 160 spam and 466 nonspam mails.Filter performance should still be climbing with datasets that small.  So their numbers may not even be an accuratemeasure of the performance of their algorithm, let alone ofBayesian spam filtering in general.But I think the most important difference is probablythat they ignored message headers.  To anyone who has workedon spam filters, this will seem a perverse decision.And yet in the very first filters I tried writing, I ignored theheaders too.  Why?  Because I wanted to keep the problem neat.I didn\\'t know much about mail headers then, and they seemed to mefull of random stuff.  There is a lesson here for filterwriters: don\\'t ignore data.  You\\'d think this lesson wouldbe too obvious to mention, but I\\'ve had to learn it several times.Third, Pantel and Lin stemmed the tokens, meaning they reduced e.g. both``mailing\\'\\' and ``mailed\\'\\' to the root ``mail\\'\\'.   They mayhave felt they were forced to do this by the small sizeof their corpus, but if so this is a kind of premature optimization.Fourth, they calculated probabilities differently.They used all the tokens, whereas I onlyuse the 15 most significant.  If you use all the tokensyou\\'ll tend to miss longer spams, the type where someone tells you their lifestory up to the point where they got rich from some multilevelmarketing scheme.  And such an algorithmwould be easy for spammers to spoof: just add a bigchunk of random text to counterbalance the spam terms.Finally, they didn\\'t bias against false positives.I thinkany spam filtering algorithm ought to have a convenientknob you can twist to decrease thefalse positive rate at the expense of the filtering rate.I do this by counting the occurrencesof tokens in the nonspam corpus double.I don\\'t think it\\'s a good idea to treat spam filtering asa straight text classification problem.  You can usetext classification techniques, but solutions can and shouldreflect the fact that the text is email, and spamin particular.  Email is not just text; it has structure.Spam filtering is not just classification, becausefalse positives are so much worse than false negativesthat you should treat them as a different kind of error.And the source of error is not just random variation, buta live human spammer working actively to defeat your filter.TokensAnother project I heard aboutafter the Slashdot article was Bill Yerazunis\\'CRM114[5].This is the counterexample to the design principle Ijust mentioned.  It\\'s a straight text classifier,but such a stunningly effective one that it manages to filterspam almost perfectly without even knowing that\\'swhat it\\'s doing.Once I understood how CRM114 worked, it seemedinevitable that I would eventually have to move from filtering basedon single words to an approach like this.  But first, I thought,I\\'ll see how far I can get with single words.  And the answer is,surprisingly far.Mostly I\\'ve been working on smarter tokenization.  Oncurrent spam, I\\'ve been able to achieve filtering rates thatapproach CRM114\\'s.  These techniques are mostly orthogonal to Bill\\'s;an optimal solution might incorporate both.``A Plan for Spam\\'\\' uses a very simpledefinition of a token.  Letters, digits, dashes, apostrophes,and dollar signs are constituent characters, and everythingelse is a token separator.  I also ignored case.Now I have a more complicated definition of a token:Case is preserved.Exclamation points are constituent characters.Periods and commas are constituents if they occur between two digits.  This lets me get ip addresses and prices intact.A price range like $20-25 yields two tokens, $20 and $25.Tokens that occur within the To, From, Subject, and Return-Path lines, or within urls, get marked accordingly.  E.g. ``foo\\'\\' in the Subject line becomes ``Subject*foo\\'\\'.  (The asterisk could be any character you don\\'t allow as a constituent.)Such measures increase the filter\\'s vocabulary, whichmakes it more discriminating.  For example, in the currentfilter, ``free\\'\\' in the Subject linehas a spam probability of 98%, whereas the same tokenin the body has a spam probability of only 65%.Here are some of the current probabilities [6]:Subject*FREE      0.9999free!!            0.9999To*free           0.9998Subject*free      0.9782free!             0.9199Free              0.9198Url*free          0.9091FREE              0.8747From*free         0.7636free              0.6546In the Plan for Spam filter, all these tokens would have had thesame probability, .7602.  That filter recognized about 23,000tokens.  The current one recognizes about 187,000.The disadvantage of having a larger universe of tokensis that there is morechance of misses.Spreading your corpus out over more tokenshas the same effect as making it smaller.If you consider exclamation points asconstituents, for example, then you could end upnot having a spam probability for free with seven exclamationpoints, even though you know that free with just two   exclamation points has a probability of 99.99%.One solution to this is what I call degeneration.  If youcan\\'t find an exact match for a token,treat it as if it were a less specificversion.  I consider terminal exclamationpoints, uppercase letters, and occurring in one of thefive marked contexts as making a token more specific.For example, if I don\\'t find a probability for``Subject*free!\\'\\', I look for probabilities for``Subject*free\\'\\', ``free!\\'\\', and ``free\\'\\', and take whichever oneis farthest from .5.Here are the alternatives [7]considered if the filter sees ``FREE!!!\\'\\' in theSubject line and doesn\\'t have a probability for it.Subject*Free!!!Subject*free!!!Subject*FREE!Subject*Free!Subject*free!Subject*FREESubject*FreeSubject*freeFREE!!!Free!!!free!!!FREE!Free!free!FREEFreefreeIf you do this, be sure to consider versions with initialcaps as well as all uppercase and all lowercase.  Spamstend to have more sentences in imperative mood, and inthose the first word is a verb.  So verbs with initial capshave higher spam probabilities than they would in all lowercase.  In my filter, the spam probability of ``Act\\'\\'is 98% and for ``act\\'\\' only 62%.If you increase your filter\\'s vocabulary, you can end upcounting the same word multiple times, according to your olddefinition of ``same\\'\\'.Logically, they\\'re not thesame token anymore.  But if this still bothers you, letme add from experience that the words you seem to becounting multiple times tend to be exactly the ones you\\'dwant to.Another effect of a larger vocabulary is that when youlook at an incoming mail you find more interesting tokens,meaning those with probabilities far from .5.  I use the15 most interesting to decide if mail is spam.But you can run into a problem when you use a fixed numberlike this.  If you find a lot of maximally interesting tokens,the result can end up being decided by whatever random factordetermines the ordering of equally interesting tokens.One way to deal with this is to treat someas more interesting than others.For example, thetoken ``dalco\\'\\' occurs 3 times in my spam corpus and neverin my legitimate corpus.  The token ``Url*optmails\\'\\'(meaning ``optmails\\'\\' within a url) occurs 1223 times.And yet, as I used to calculate probabilities for tokens,both would have the same spam probability, the threshold of .99.That doesn\\'t feel right.  There are theoreticalarguments for giving these two tokens substantially differentprobabilities (Pantel and Lin do), but I haven\\'t tried that yet.It does seem at least that if we find more than 15 tokensthat only occur in one corpus or the other, we ought togive priority to the ones that occur a lot.  So nowthere are two threshold values.  For tokens that occur onlyin the spam corpus, the probability is .9999 if theyoccur more than 10 times and .9998 otherwise.  Dittoat the other end of the scale for tokens foundonly in the legitimate corpus.I may later scale token probabilities substantially,but this tiny amount of scaling at least ensures that tokens get sorted the right way.Another possibility would be to consider notjust 15 tokens, but all the tokens over a certainthreshold of interestingness.  Steven Hauser does thisin his statistical spam filter [8].If you use a threshold, make it very high, orspammers could spoof you by packing messages withmore innocent words.Finally, what should one doabout html?  I\\'ve tried the whole spectrum of options, fromignoring it to parsing it all.  Ignoring html is a bad idea,because it\\'s full of useful spam signs.  But if you parse it all, your filter might degenerate into a mere html   recognizer.  The most effective approachseems to be the middle course, to notice some tokens but notothers.  I look at a, img, and font tags, and ignore therest.  Links and images you should certainly look at, becausethey contain urls.I could probably be smarter about dealing with html, but Idon\\'t think it\\'s worth putting a lot of time into this.Spams full of html are easy to filter.  The smarterspammers already avoid it.  Soperformance in the future should not depend much on howyou deal with html.PerformanceBetween December 10 2002 and January 10 2003 I got about1750 spams.  Of these, 4 got through.  That\\'s a filteringrate of about 99.75%.Two of the four spams I missed got through because theyhappened to use words that occur often in my legitimateemail.The third was one of those that exploitan insecure cgi script to send mail to third parties.They\\'re hard to filter based juston the content because the headers are innocent and   they\\'re careful about the words they use.  Even so I canusually catch them.  This one squeaked by with aprobability of .88, just under the threshold of .9.Of course, looking at multiple token sequenceswould catch it easily.  ``Below is the result ofyour feedback form\\'\\' is an instant giveaway.The fourth spam was what I calla spam-of-the-future, because this is what I expect spam toevolve into: some completely neutraltext followed by a url.  In this case it was was fromsomeone saying they had finally finished their homepageand would I go look at it.  (The page was of course an    ad for a porn site.)If the spammers are careful about the headers and use afresh url, there is nothing in spam-of-the-future for filtersto notice.  We can of course counter by sending acrawler to look at the page.  But that might not be necessary.The response rate for spam-of-the-future mustbe low, or everyone would be doing it.If it\\'s low enough,itwon\\'t payfor spammers to send it, and we won\\'t have to work too hard on filtering it.Now for the really shocking news: during that same one-monthperiod I gotthreefalse positives.In a way it\\'sa relief to get some false positives.  When I wrote ``A Planfor Spam\\'\\' I hadn\\'t had any, and I didn\\'t know what they\\'dbe like.  Now that I\\'ve had a few, I\\'m relieved to findthey\\'re not as bad as I feared.False positives yielded by statisticalfilters turn out to be mails that sound a lot like spam, andthese tend to be the ones you would least mind missing [9].Two of the false positives were newslettersfrom companies I\\'ve bought things from.  I neverasked to receive them, so arguably theywere spams, but I count them as false positives becauseI hadn\\'t been deleting them as spams before.  The reasonthe filters caught them was that both companies in   January switched to commercial email sendersinstead of sending the mails from their own servers,  and both the headers and the bodies became much spammier.The third false positive was a bad one, though.  It was from someone in Egypt and written in all uppercase.  This wasa direct result of making tokens case sensitive; the Planfor Spam filter wouldn\\'t have caught it.It\\'s hard to say what the overall false positive rate is,because we\\'re up in the noise, statistically.Anyone who has worked on filters (at least, effective filters) willbe aware of this problem.With some emails it\\'shard to say whether they\\'re spam or not, and these arethe ones you end up looking at when you get filters       really tight.  For example, so far the filter hascaught two emails that were sent to my address becauseof a typo, and one sent to me in the belief that I was someone else.  Arguably, these are neither my spamnor my nonspam mail.Another false positive was from a vice president at Virtumundo.I wrote to them pretending to be a customer,and since the reply came back through Virtumundo\\'s mail servers it had the most incriminatingheaders imaginable.  Arguably this isn\\'t a real falsepositive either, but a sort of Heisenberg uncertaintyeffect: I only got it because I was writing about spam  filtering.Not counting these, I\\'ve had a total of five false positivesso far, out of about 7740 legitimate emails, a rate of .06%.The other two were a notice that something I boughtwas back-ordered, and a party reminder from Evite.I don\\'t think this number can be trusted, partlybecause the sample is so small, and partly becauseI think I can fix the filter not to catchsome of these.False positives seem to me a different kind of error fromfalse negatives.Filtering rate is a measure of performance.  Falsepositives I consider more like bugs.  I approach improving thefiltering rate as optimization, and decreasing falsepositives as debugging.So these five false positives are my bug list.  For example, the mail from Egypt got nailed because the uppercase textmade it look to the filter like a Nigerian spam.This really is kind of a bug.  As withhtml, the email being all uppercase is really conceptuallyonefeature, not one for each word.  I need to handle case in amore sophisticated way.So what to make of this .06%?  Not much, I think.  You couldtreat it as an upper bound, bearing in mind the small sample size.But at this stage it is more a measure of the bugsin my implementation than some intrinsic false positive rateof Bayesian filtering.FutureWhat next?  Filtering is an optimization problem,and the key to optimization is profiling.  Don\\'ttry to guess where your code is slow, because you\\'llguess wrong.Lookat where your code is slow,and fix that.  In filtering, this translates to:   look at the spams you miss, and figure out what youcould have done to catch them.For example, spammers are now working aggressively to   evade filters, and one of the things they\\'re doing isbreaking up and misspelling words to prevent filters fromrecognizing them.  But working on this is not my firstpriority, because I still have no trouble catching thesespams [10].There are two kinds of spams I currently dohave trouble with.One is the type that pretends to be an email from a woman inviting you to go chat with her or see her profile on a datingsite.  These get through because they\\'re the one type ofsales pitch you can make without using sales talk.  They usethe same vocabulary as ordinary email.The other kind of spams I have trouble filtering are thosefrom companies in e.g. Bulgaria offering contract programming services.   These get through because I\\'m a programmer too, andthe spams are full of the same words as my real mail.I\\'ll probably focus on the personal ad type first.  I think ifI look closer I\\'ll be able to find statistical differencesbetween these and my real mail.  The style of writing iscertainly different, though it may take multiword filteringto catch that.Also, I notice they tend to repeat the url,and someone including a url in a legitimate mail wouldn\\'t do that [11].The outsourcing type are going to be hard to catch.  Even if you sent a crawler to the site, you wouldn\\'t find a smokingstatistical gun.Maybe the only answer is a central list ofdomains advertised in spams [12].  But there can\\'t be thatmany of this type of mail.  If the onlyspams left were unsolicited offers of contract programmingservices from Bulgaria, we could all probably move on toworking on something else.Will statistical filtering actually get us to that point?I don\\'t know.  Right now, for me personally, spam isnot a problem.  But spammers haven\\'t yet made a seriouseffort to spoof statistical filters.  What will happen when they do?I\\'m not optimistic about filters that work at thenetwork level [13].When there is a static obstacle worth getting past, spammersare pretty efficient at getting past it.  Thereis already a company called Assurance Systems that willrun your mail through Spamassassin and tell you whether it will get filtered out.Network-level filters won\\'t be completely useless.They may be enough to kill all the \"opt-in\"spam, meaning spam from companies like Virtumundo andEqualamail who claim that they\\'re really running opt-in lists.You can filter those based just on the headers, nomatter what they say in the body.  But anyone willing tofalsify headers or use open relays, presumably includingmost porn spammers, should be able to get some message pastnetwork-level filters if they want to.  (By no means themessage they\\'d like to send though, which is something.)The kind of filters I\\'m optimistic about are ones thatcalculate probabilities based on each individual user\\'s mail.These can be much more effective, not only inavoiding false positives, but in filtering too: for example,finding the recipient\\'s email address base-64 encoded anywhere ina message is a very good spam indicator.But the real advantage of individual filters is that they\\'ll all bedifferent.  If everyone\\'s filters have different probabilities,it will make the spammers\\' optimization loop, what programmerswould call their edit-compile-test cycle, appallingly slow.  Instead of just tweaking a spam till it gets through a copy ofsome filter they have on their desktop, they\\'ll have to do atest mailing for each tweak.  It would be like programming ina language without an interactive toplevel, and I wouldn\\'t wish thaton anyone.'},\n",

       "  'date': 'Want to start a startup?',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.Watch how this essay waswritten.February 2009One of the things I always tell startups is a principle I learnedfrom Paul Buchheit: it\\'s better to make a few people really happythan to make a lot of people semi-happy.  I was saying recently toa reporter that if I could only tell startups 10 things, this wouldbe one of them.  Then I thought: what would the other 9 be?When I made the list there turned out to be 13:1. Pick good cofounders.Cofounders are for a startup what location is for real estate.  Youcan change anything about a house except where it is.  In a startupyou can change your idea easily, but changing your cofounders ishard.And the success of a startup is almost always a functionof its founders.2. Launch fast.The reason to launch fast is not so much that it\\'s critical to getyour product to market early, but that you haven\\'t really startedworking on it till you\\'ve launched.  Launching teaches you what youshould have been building.  Till you know that you\\'re wasting yourtime.  So the main value of whatever you launch with is as a pretextfor engaging users.3. Let your idea evolve.This is the second half of launching fast. Launch fast and iterate.It\\'s a big mistake to treat a startup as if it were merely a matterof implementing some brilliant initial idea. As in an essay, mostof the ideas appear in the implementing.4. Understand your users.You can envision the wealth created by a startup as a rectangle,where one side is the number of users and the other is how much youimprove their lives.The second dimension is the one you havemost control over.  And indeed, the growth in the first will bedriven by how well you do in the second.  As in science, the hardpart is not answering questions but asking them: the hard part isseeing something new that users lack. The better you understandthem the better the odds of doing that. That\\'s why so many successfulstartups make something the founders needed.5. Better to make a few users love you than a lot ambivalent.Ideally you want to make large numbers of users love you, but youcan\\'t expect to hit that right away.  Initially you have to choosebetween satisfying all the needs of a subset of potential users,or satisfying a subset of the needs of all potential users.  Takethe first. It\\'s easier to expand userwise than satisfactionwise.And perhaps more importantly, it\\'s harder to lie to yourself.  Ifyou think you\\'re 85% of the way to a great product, how do you knowit\\'s not 70%?  Or 10%?  Whereas it\\'s easy to know how many usersyou have.6. Offer surprisingly good customer service.Customers are used to being maltreated.  Most of the companies theydeal with are quasi-monopolies that get away with atrocious customerservice. Your own ideas about what\\'s possible have been unconsciouslylowered by such experiences.  Try making your customer service notmerely good, butsurprisingly good.  Go out of your way to makepeople happy.  They\\'ll be overwhelmed; you\\'ll see.  In the earlieststages of a startup, it pays to offer customer service on a levelthat wouldn\\'t scale, because it\\'s a way of learning about yourusers.7. You make what you measure.I learned this one from Joe Kraus.Merely measuring somethinghas an uncanny tendency to improve it.  If you want to make youruser numbers go up, put a big piece of paper on your wall and everyday plot the number of users.  You\\'ll be delighted when it goes upand disappointed when it goes down.  Pretty soon you\\'ll startnoticing what makes the number go up, and you\\'ll start to do moreof that.  Corollary: be careful what you measure.8. Spend little.I can\\'t emphasize enough how important it is for a startup to be cheap.Most startups fail before they make something people want, and themost common form of failure is running out of money.  So being cheapis (almost) interchangeable with iterating rapidly.But it\\'smore than that.  A culture of cheapness keeps companies young insomething like the way exercise keeps people young.9. Get ramen profitable.\"Ramen profitable\" means a startup makes just enough to pay thefounders\\' living expenses.  It\\'s not rapid prototyping for businessmodels (though it can be), but more a way of hacking the investmentprocess.  Once you cross over into ramen profitable, it completelychanges your relationship with investors.  It\\'s also great formorale.10. Avoid distractions.Nothing kills startups like distractions.  The worst type are thosethat pay money: day jobs, consulting, profitable side-projects.The startup may have more long-term potential, but you\\'ll alwaysinterrupt working on it to answer calls from people paying you now.Paradoxically,fundraisingis this type of distraction, so try tominimize that too.11. Don\\'t get demoralized.Though the immediate cause of death in a startup tends to be runningout of money, the underlying cause is usually lack of focus.  Eitherthe company is run by stupid people (which can\\'t be fixed withadvice) or the people are smart but got demoralized.  Starting astartup is a huge moral weight.  Understand this and make a consciouseffort not to be ground down by it, just as you\\'d be careful tobend at the knees when picking up a heavy box.12. Don\\'t give up.Even if you get demoralized,don\\'t give up.  You can get surprisinglyfar by just not giving up.  This isn\\'t true in all fields.  Thereare a lot of people who couldn\\'t become good mathematicians nomatter how long they persisted.  But startups aren\\'t like that.Sheer effort is usually enough, so long as you keep morphing youridea.13. Deals fall through.One of the most useful skills we learned from Viaweb was not gettingour hopes up.  We probably had 20 deals of various types fallthrough.  After the first 10 or so we learned to treat deals asbackground processes that we should ignore till they terminated.It\\'s very dangerous to morale to start to depend on deals closing,not just because they so often don\\'t, but because it makes themless likely to.Having gotten it down to 13 sentences, I asked myself which I\\'dchoose if I could only keep one.Understand your users.  That\\'s the key.  The essential task in astartup is to create wealth; the dimension of wealth you have mostcontrol over is how much you improve users\\' lives; and the hardestpart of that is knowing what to make for them.  Once you know whatto make, it\\'s mere effort to make it, and most decent hackers arecapable of that.Understanding your users is part of half the principles in thislist.  That\\'s the reason to launch early, to understand your users.Evolving your idea is the embodiment of understanding your users.Understanding your users well will tend to push you toward makingsomething that makes a few people deeply happy.  The most importantreason for having surprisingly good customer service is that ithelps you understand your users.  And understanding your users willeven ensure your morale, because when everything else is collapsingaround you, having just ten users who love you will keep you going.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'American technology companies want the government to make immigrationeasier because they say they can\\'t find enough programmers in theUS.  Anti-immigration people say that instead of letting foreignerstake these jobs, we should train more Americans to be programmers.Who\\'s right?The technology companies are right. What the anti-immigration peopledon\\'t understand is that there is a huge variation in ability betweencompetent programmers and exceptional ones, and while you can trainpeople to be competent, you can\\'t train them to be exceptional.Exceptional programmers have an aptitude for andinterest inprogramming that is not merely the product of training.The US has less than 5% of the world\\'s population.  Which means ifthe qualities that make someone a great programmer are evenlydistributed, 95% of great programmers are born outside the US.The anti-immigration people have to invent some explanation toaccount for all the effort technology companies have expended tryingto make immigration easier.  So they claim it\\'s because they wantto drive down salaries.  But if you talk to startups, you findpractically every one over a certain size has gone through legalcontortions to get programmers into the US, where they thenpaid them the same as they\\'d have paid an American.  Why would theygo to extra trouble to get programmers for the same price?  Theonly explanation is that they\\'re telling the truth: there are justnot enough great programmers to go around.I asked the CEO of a startup with about 70 programmers how manymore he\\'d hire if he could get all the great programmers he wanted.He said \"We\\'d hire 30 tomorrow morning.\"  And this is one of thehot startups that always win recruiting battles. It\\'s the same allover Silicon Valley.  Startups are that constrained for talent.It would be great if more Americans were trained as programmers,but no amount of training can flip a ratio as overwhelming as 95to 5. Especially since programmers are being trained in othercountries too.  Barring some cataclysm, it will always be true thatmost great programmers are born outside the US.  It will always betrue that most people who are great at anything are born outsidethe US.Exceptional performance implies immigration.  A country with onlya few percent of the world\\'s population will be exceptional in somefield only if there are a lot of immigrants working in it.But this whole discussion has taken something for granted: that ifwe let more great programmers into the US, they\\'ll want to come.That\\'s true now, and we don\\'t realize how lucky we are that it is.If we want to keep this option open, the best way to do it is totake advantage of it: the more of the world\\'s great programmers arehere, the more the rest will want to come here.And if we don\\'t, the US could be seriously fucked. I realize that\\'sstrong language, but the people dithering about this don\\'t seem torealize the power of the forces at work here.  Technology gives thebest programmers huge leverage.  The world market in programmersseems to be becoming dramatically more liquid.  And since goodpeople like good colleagues, that means the best programmers couldcollect in just a few hubs.  Maybe mostly in one hub.What if most of the great programmers collected in one hub, and itwasn\\'t here?  That scenario may seem unlikely now, but it won\\'t beif things change as much in the next 50 years as they did in thelast 50.We have the potential to ensure that the US remains a technologysuperpower just by letting in a few thousand great programmers ayear.  What a colossal mistake it would be to let that opportunityslip.  It could easily be the defining mistake this generation ofAmerican politicians later become famous for.  And unlike otherpotential mistakes on that scale, it costs nothing to fix.So please, get on with it.'},\n",

And yet if I had to write down everythingI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than apage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasyfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read allthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid\\'s excellentbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to thisquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.She writes:Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"That has always seemed to me an important point, and I was evenmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  Acombination of my own experience and other things I\\'d read.  Noneof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I\\'d forgetthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in theimportance of this idea would remain something I\\'d learned fromthis book, even after I\\'d forgotten I\\'d learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even ifyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your modelof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you\\'velost the source of.  It works, but you don\\'t know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin\\'s chronicleis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,Venice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn\\'tmean I couldn\\'t have read more attentively, but at least the harvestof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  Butit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else whofelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they\\'d read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better aboutforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at thetime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  Thesame book would get compiled differently at different points inyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading importantbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings aboutrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with worklike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign youdid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"seems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn\\'t limited to books.  Technologywill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  Whenpeople do that today it\\'s usually to enjoy them again (e.g. whenlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug intheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in rememberingthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But astechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, itmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goalin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereadinga book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences butalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how youknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': '(This essay is derived from a keynote talk at the 2007 ASES Summitat Stanford.)The world of investors is a foreign one to most hackers—partlybecause investors are so unlike hackers, and partly because theytend to operate in secret.  I\\'ve been dealing with this world formany years, both as a founder and an investor, and I still don\\'tfully understand it.In this essay I\\'m going to list some of the more surprising thingsI\\'ve learned about investors.  Some I only learned in the past year.Teaching hackers how to deal with investors is probably the secondmost important thing we do at Y Combinator.  The most importantthing for a startup is to make something good.  But everyone knowsthat\\'s important.  The dangerous thing about investors is thathackers don\\'t know how little they know about this strange world.1. The investors are what make a startup hub.About a year ago I tried to figure out what you\\'d need to reproduceSilicon Valley.  I decided the critical ingredients were rich peopleand nerds—investors and founders.  People are all you need tomake technology, and all the other people will move.If I had to narrow that down, I\\'d say investors are the limitingfactor.  Not because they contribute more to the startup, but simplybecause they\\'re least willing to move.  They\\'re rich.  They\\'re notgoing to move to Albuquerque just because there are some smarthackers there they could invest in.  Whereas hackers will move tothe Bay Area to find investors.2. Angel investors are the most critical.There are several types of investors.  The two main categories areangels and VCs: VCs invest other people\\'s money, and angels investtheir own.Though they\\'re less well known, the angel investors are probablythe more critical ingredient in creating a silicon valley.  Mostcompanies that VCs invest in would never have made it that far if angelshadn\\'t invested first.  VCs say between half and three quarters ofcompanies that raise series A rounds have taken some outsideinvestment already.Angels are willing to fund riskier projects than VCs.  They alsogive valuable advice, because (unlike VCs) many have been startupfounders themselves.Google\\'s story shows the key role angels play. A lot of people knowGoogle raised money from Kleiner and Sequoia.  What most don\\'t realizeis how late.  That VC round was a series B round; the premoneyvaluation was $75 million.  Google was already a successful companyat that point.  Really, Google was funded with angel money.It may seem odd that the canonical Silicon Valley startup was fundedby angels, but this is not so surprising.  Risk is always proportionateto reward.  So the most successful startup of all is likely to haveseemed an extremely risky bet at first, and that is exactly thekind VCs won\\'t touch.Where do angel investors come from?  From other startups.  So startuphubs like Silicon Valley benefit from something like the marketplaceeffect, but shifted in time: startups are there because startupswere there.3. Angels don\\'t like publicity.If angels are so important, why do we hear more about VCs?  BecauseVCs like publicity.  They need to market themselves to the investorswho are their \"customers\"—the endowments and pension funds andrich families whose money they invest—and also to founders whomight come to them for funding.Angels don\\'t need to market themselves to investors because theyinvest their own money.  Nor do they want to market themselves tofounders: they don\\'t want random people pestering them with businessplans.  Actually, neither do VCs.  Both angels and VCs get dealsalmost exclusively through personal introductions.The reason VCs want a strong brand is not to draw in more businessplans over the transom, but so they win deals when competingagainst other VCs.  Whereas angels are rarely in direct competition,because (a) they do fewer deals, (b) they\\'re happy to split them,and (c) they invest at a point where the stream is broader.4. Most investors, especially VCs, are not like founders.Some angels are, or were, hackers.  But most VCs are a differenttype of people: they\\'re dealmakers.If you\\'re a hacker, here\\'s a thought experiment you can run tounderstand why there are basically no hacker VCs: How would youlike a job where you never got to make anything, but instead spentall your time listening to other people pitch (mostly terrible)projects, deciding whether to fund them, and sitting on their boardsif you did?  That would not be fun for most hackers.  Hackers liketo make things.  This would be like being an administrator.Because most VCs are a different species of people fromfounders, it\\'s hard to know what they\\'re thinking.  If you\\'re ahacker, the last time you had to deal with these guys was in highschool.  Maybe in college you walked past their fraternity on yourway to the lab.  But don\\'t underestimate them.  They\\'re as expertin their world as you are in yours.  What they\\'re good at is readingpeople, and making deals work to their advantage.  Think twicebefore you try to beat them at that.5. Most investors are momentum investors.Because most investors are dealmakers rather than technology people,they generally don\\'t understand what you\\'re doing.  I knew as afounder that most VCs didn\\'t get technology.  I also knew some madea lot of money.  And yet it never occurred to me till recently toput those two ideas together and ask \"How can VCs make money byinvesting in stuff they don\\'t understand?\"The answer is that they\\'re like momentum investors.  You can (orcould once) make a lot of money by noticing sudden changes in stockprices.  When a stock jumps upward, you buy, and when it suddenlydrops, you sell.  In effect you\\'re insider trading, without knowingwhat you know.  You just know someone knows something, and that\\'smaking the stock move.This is how most venture investors operate.  They don\\'t try to lookat something and predict whether it will take off.  They win bynoticing that somethingistaking off a little sooner than everyoneelse.  That generates almost as good returns as actually being ableto pick winners.  They may have to pay a little more than they wouldif they got in at the very beginning, but only a little.Investors always say what they really care about is the team.Actually what they care most about is your traffic, then what otherinvestors think, then the team.  If you don\\'t yet have any traffic,they fall back on number 2, what other investors think.  And this,as you can imagine, produces wild oscillations in the \"stock price\"of a startup.  One week everyone wants you, and they\\'re begging notto be cut out of the deal.  But all it takes is for one big investorto cool on you, and the next week no one will return your phonecalls.  We regularly have startups go from hot to cold or cold tohot in a matter of days, and literally nothing has changed.There are two ways to deal with this phenomenon.  If you\\'re feelingreally confident, you can try to ride it.  You can start by askinga comparatively lowly VC for a small amount of money, and then aftergenerating interest there, ask more prestigious VCs for largeramounts, stirring up a crescendo of buzz, and then \"sell\" at thetop.  This is extremely risky, and takes months even if you succeed.I wouldn\\'t try it myself.  My advice is to err on the side of safety:when someone offers you a decent deal, just take it and get on withbuilding the company.  Startups win or lose based on the qualityof their product, not the quality of their funding deals.6. Most investors are looking for big hits.Venture investors like companies that could go public.  That\\'s wherethe big returns are.  They know the odds of any individual startupgoing public are small, but they want to invest in those that atleast have achanceof going public.Currently the way VCs seem to operate is to invest in a bunch ofcompanies, most of which fail, and one of which is Google.  Thosefew big wins compensate for losses on their other investments.  What thismeans is that most VCs will only invest in you if you\\'re a potentialGoogle.  They don\\'t care about companies that are a safe bet to beacquired for $20 million.  There needs to be a chance, howeversmall, of the company becoming really big.Angels are different in this respect.  They\\'re happy to invest ina company where the most likely outcome is a $20 million acquisitionif they can do it at a low enough valuation.  But of course theylike companies that could go public too.  So having an ambitiouslong-term plan pleases everyone.If you take VC money, you have to mean it, because the structureof VC deals prevents early acquisitions.  If you take VC money,they won\\'t let you sell early.7. VCs want to invest large amounts.The fact that they\\'re running investment funds makes VCs want toinvest large amounts.  A typical VC fund is now hundreds of millionsof dollars.  If $400 million has to be invested by 10 partners,they have to invest $40 million each.  VCs usually sit on the boardsof companies they fund.  If the average deal size was $1 million,each partner would have to sit on 40 boards, which would not befun.  So they prefer bigger deals, where they can put a lot of moneyto work at once.VCs don\\'t regard you as a bargain if you don\\'t need a lot of money.That may even make you less attractive, because it means theirinvestment creates less of a barrier to entry for competitors.Angels are in a different position because they\\'re investing theirown money.  They\\'re happy to invest small amounts—sometimes aslittle as $20,000—as long as the potential returns look goodenough.  So if you\\'re doing something inexpensive, go to angels.8. Valuations are fiction.VCs admit that valuations are an artifact.  They decide how muchmoney you need and how much of the company they want, and those twoconstraints yield a valuation.Valuations increase as the size of the investment does.  A companythat an angel is willing to put $50,000 into at a valuation of amillion can\\'t take $6 million from VCs at that valuation.  Thatwould leave the founders less than a seventh of the company betweenthem (since the option pool would also come out of that seventh).Most VCs wouldn\\'t want that, which is why you never hear of dealswhere a VC invests $6 million at a premoney valuation of $1 million.If valuations change depending on the amount invested, that showshow far they are from reflecting any kind of value of the company.Since valuations are made up, founders shouldn\\'t care too much aboutthem.  That\\'s not the part to focus on.  In fact, a high valuationcan be a bad thing.  If you take funding at a premoney valuationof $10 million, you won\\'t be selling the company for 20.  You\\'llhave to sell for over 50 for the VCs to get even a 5x return, whichis low to them.  More likely they\\'ll want you to hold out for 100.But needing to get a high price decreases the chance of gettingbought at all; many companies can buy you for $10 million, but onlya handful for 100.  And since a startup is like a pass/fail coursefor the founders, what you want to optimize is your chance of agood outcome, not the percentage of the company you keep.So why do founders chase high valuations?  They\\'re tricked bymisplaced ambition.  They feel they\\'ve achieved more if they get ahigher valuation.  They usually know other founders, and if theyget a higher valuation they can say \"mine is bigger than yours.\"But funding is not the real test.  The real test is the final outcomefor the founder, and getting too high a valuation may just make agood outcome less likely.The one advantage of a high valuation is that you get less dilution.But there is another less sexy way to achieve that: just take lessmoney.9. Investors look for founders like the current stars.Ten years ago investors were looking for the next Bill Gates.  Thiswas a mistake, because Microsoft was a very anomalous startup.  Theystarted almost as a contract programming operation, and the reasonthey became huge was that IBM happened to drop the PC standard intheir lap.Now all the VCs are looking for the next Larry and Sergey.  Thisis a good trend, because Larry and Sergey are closer to the idealstartup founders.Historically investors thought it was important for a founder tobe an expert in business.  So they were willing to fund teams ofMBAs who planned to use the money to pay programmers to build theirproduct for them.  This is like funding Steve Ballmer in the hopethat the programmer he\\'ll hire is Bill Gates—kind of backward,as the events of the Bubble showed.  Now most VCs know they shouldbe funding technical guys.  This is more pronounced among the verytop funds; the lamer ones still want to fund MBAs.If you\\'re a hacker, it\\'s good news that investors are looking forLarry and Sergey.  The bad news is, the only investors who can doit right are the ones who knew them when they were acouple of CS grad students, not the confident media stars they aretoday.  What investors still don\\'t get is how clueless and tentativegreat founders can seem at the very beginning.10. The contribution of investors tends to be underestimated.Investors do more for startups than give them money.  They\\'re helpfulin doing deals and arranging introductions, and some of the smarterones, particularly angels, can give good advice about the product.In fact, I\\'d say what separates the great investors from the mediocreones is the quality of their advice.  Most investors give advice,but the top ones givegoodadvice.Whatever help investors give a startup tends to be underestimated.It\\'s to everyone\\'s advantage to let the world think the foundersthought of everything.  The goal of the investors is for the companyto become valuable, and the company seems more valuable if it seemslike all the good ideas came from within.This trend is compounded by the obsession that the press has withfounders.  In a company founded by two people, 10% of the ideasmight come from the first guy they hire.  Arguably they\\'ve done abad job of hiring otherwise.  And yet this guy will be almostentirely overlooked by the press.I say this as a founder: the contribution of founders is alwaysoverestimated.  The danger here is that new founders, looking atexisting founders, will think that they\\'re supermen that one couldn\\'tpossibly equal oneself.  Actually they have a hundred differenttypes of support people just offscreen making the whole show possible.11. VCs are afraid of looking bad.I\\'ve been very surprised to discover how timid most VCs are.  Theyseem to be afraid of looking bad to their partners, and perhapsalso to the limited partners—the people whose money they invest.You can measure this fear in how much less risk VCs are willing totake.  You can tell they won\\'t make investments for their fund thatthey might be willing to make themselves as angels.  Though it\\'snot quite accurate to say that VCs are less willing to take risks.They\\'re less willing to do things that might look bad.  That\\'s notthe same thing.For example, most VCs would be very reluctant to invest in a startupfounded by a pair of 18 year old hackers, no matter how brilliant,because if the startup failed their partners could turn on them andsay \"What, you invested $x million of our money in a pair of 18year olds?\"  Whereas if a VC invested in a startup founded bythree former banking executives in their 40s who planned to outsourcetheir product development—which to my mind is actually a lotriskier than investing in a pair of really smart 18 year olds—hecouldn\\'t be faulted, if it failed, for making such an apparentlyprudent investment.As a friend of mine said, \"Most VCs can\\'t do anything that wouldsound bad to the kind of doofuses who run pension funds.\" Angelscan take greater risks because they don\\'t have to answer to anyone.12. Being turned down by investors doesn\\'t mean much.Some founders are quite dejected when they get turned down byinvestors.  They shouldn\\'t take it so much to heart.  To start with,investors are often wrong.  It\\'s hard to think of a successfulstartup that wasn\\'t turned down by investors at some point.  Lotsof VCs rejected Google.  So obviously the reaction of investors isnot a very meaningful test.Investors will often reject you for what seem to be superficialreasons.  I read of one VC whoturneddowna startup simply becausethey\\'d given away so many little bits of stock that the deal requiredtoo many signatures to close.The reason investors can get awaywith this is that they see so many deals.  It doesn\\'t matter ifthey underestimate you because of some surface imperfection, becausethe next best deal will bealmost as good.  Imagine picking outapples at a grocery store.  You grab one with a little bruise.Maybe it\\'s just a surface bruise, but why even bother checking whenthere are so many other unbruised apples to choose from?Investors would be the first to admit they\\'re often wrong.  So whenyou get rejected by investors, don\\'t think \"we suck,\" but insteadask \"do we suck?\"  Rejection is a question, not an answer.13. Investors are emotional.I\\'ve been surprised to discover how emotional investors can be.You\\'d expect them to be cold and calculating, or at least businesslike,but often they\\'re not.  I\\'m not sure if it\\'s their position of powerthat makes them this way, or the large sums of money involved, butinvestment negotiations can easily turn personal.  If you offendinvestors, they\\'ll leave in a huff.A while ago an eminent VC firm offered a series A round to a startupwe\\'d seed funded.  Then they heard a rival VC firm was also interested.They were so afraid that they\\'d be rejected in favor of this otherfirm that they gave the startup what\\'s known as an \"explodingtermsheet.\"  They had, I think, 24 hours to say yes or no, or thedeal was off.  Exploding termsheets are a somewhat dubious device,but not uncommon.  What surprised me was their reaction when Icalled to talk about it.  I asked if they\\'d still be interested inthe startup if the rival VC didn\\'t end up making an offer, and theysaid no.  What rational basis could they have had for saying that?If they thought the startup was worth investing in, what differenceshould it make what some other VC thought?  Surely it was theirduty to their limited partners simply to invest in the bestopportunities they found; they should be delighted if the other VCsaid no, because it would mean they\\'d overlooked a good opportunity.But of course there was no rational basis for their decision.  Theyjust couldn\\'t stand the idea of taking this rival firm\\'s rejects.In this case the exploding termsheet was not (or not only) a tacticto pressure the startup.  It was more like the high school trickof breaking up with someone before they can break up with you.  Inanearlier essayI said that VCs were a lot like high school girls.A few VCs have joked about that characterization, but none havedisputed it.14. The negotiation never stops till the closing.Most deals, for investment or acquisition, happen in two phases.There\\'s an initial phase of negotiation about the big questions.If this succeeds you get a termsheet, so called because it outlinesthe key terms of a deal.  A termsheet is not legally binding,but it is a definite step.  It\\'s supposed to mean that adeal is going to happen, once the lawyers work out all the details.In theory these details are minor ones; by definition all theimportant points are supposed to be covered in the termsheet.Inexperience and wishful thinking combine to make founders feelthat when they have a termsheet, they have a deal.  They want thereto be a deal; everyone acts like they have a deal; so there mustbe a deal.  But there isn\\'t and may not be for several months.  Alot can change for a startup in several months.  It\\'s not uncommonfor investors and acquirers to get buyer\\'s remorse.  So you haveto keep pushing, keep selling, all the way to the close.  Otherwiseall the \"minor\" details left unspecified in the termsheet will beinterpreted to your disadvantage.  The other side may even breakthe deal; if they do that, they\\'ll usually seize on some technicalityor claim you misled them, rather than admitting they changed theirminds.It can be hard to keep the pressure on an investor or acquirer allthe way to the closing, because the most effective pressure iscompetition from other investors or acquirers, and these tend todrop away when you get a termsheet.  You should try to stay as closefriends as you can with these rivals, but the most important thingis just to keep up the momentum in your startup.  The investors oracquirers chose you because you seemed hot.  Keep doing whatevermade you seem hot.  Keep releasing new features; keep getting newusers; keep getting mentioned in the press and in blogs.15. Investors like to co-invest.I\\'ve been surprised how willing investors are to split deals.  Youmight think that if they found a good deal they\\'d want it all tothemselves, but they seem positively eager to syndicate.  This isunderstandable with angels; they invest on a smaller scale and don\\'tlike to have too much money tied up in any one deal.  But VCs alsoshare deals a lot.  Why?Partly I think this is an artifact of the rule I quoted earlier:after traffic, VCs care most what other VCs think.  A deal that hasmultiple VCs interested in it is more likely to close, so of dealsthat close, more will have multiple investors.There is one rational reason to want multiple VCs in a deal: Anyinvestor who co-invests with you is one less investor who couldfund a competitor.  Apparently Kleiner and Sequoia didn\\'t likesplitting the Google deal, but it did at least have the advantage,from each one\\'s point of view, that there probably wouldn\\'t be acompetitor funded by the other.  Splitting deals thus has similaradvantages to confusing paternity.But I think the main reason VCs like splitting deals is the fearof looking bad.  If another firm shares the deal, then in the eventof failure it will seem to have been a prudent choice—a consensusdecision, rather than just the whim of an individual partner.16. Investors collude.Investing is not covered by antitrust law.  At least, it better notbe, because investors regularly do things that would be illegalotherwise.  I know personally of cases where one investor has talkedanother out of making a competitive offer, using the promise ofsharing future deals.In principle investors are all competing for the same deals, butthe spirit of cooperation is stronger than the spirit of competition.The reason, again, is that there are so many deals.  Though aprofessional investor may have a closer relationship with a founderhe invests in than with other investors, his relationship with thefounder is only going to last a couple years, whereas his relationshipwith other firms will last his whole career.  There isn\\'t so muchat stake in his interactions with other investors, but there willbe a lot of them.  Professional investors are constantly tradinglittle favors.Another reason investors stick together is to preserve the powerof investors as a whole.  So you will not, as of this writing, beable to get investors into an auction for your series A round.They\\'d rather lose the deal than establish a precedent of VCscompetitively bidding against one another.  An efficient startupfunding market may be coming in the distant future; things tend tomove in that direction; but it\\'s certainly not here now.17. Large-scale investors care about their portfolio, not anyindividual company.The reason startups work so well is that everyone with power alsohas equity.  The only way any of them can succeed is if they alldo.  This makes everyone naturally pull in the same direction,subject to differences of opinion about tactics.The problem is, larger scale investors don\\'t have exactly the samemotivation.  Close, but not identical. They don\\'t need any givenstartup to succeed, like founders do, just their portfolio as awhole to.  So in borderline cases the rational thing for them todo is to sacrifice unpromising startups.Large-scale investors tend to put startups in three categories:successes, failures, and the \"living dead\"—companies that areplugging along but don\\'t seem likely in the immediate future to getbought or go public.  To the founders, \"living dead\" sounds harsh.These companies may be far from failures by ordinary standards. Butthey might as well be from a venture investor\\'s point of view, andthey suck up just as much time and attention as the successes.  Soif such a company has two possible strategies, a conservative onethat\\'s slightly more likely to work in the end, or a risky one thatwithin a short time will either yield a giant success or kill thecompany, VCs will push for the kill-or-cure option.  To them thecompany is already a write-off.  Better to have resolution, one wayor the other, as soon as possible.If a startup gets into real trouble, instead of trying to save itVCs may just sell it at a low price to another of their portfoliocompanies.  Philip Greenspun said inFounders at Workthat Ars Digita\\'s VCs did this to them.18. Investors have different risk profiles from founders.Most people would rather a 100% chance of $1 million than a 20%chance of $10 million.  Investors are rich enough to be rationaland prefer the latter.  So they\\'ll always tend to encourage foundersto keep rolling the dice.  If a company is doing well, investorswill want founders to turn down most acquisition offers.  And indeed,most startups that turn down acquisition offers ultimately do better.But it\\'s still hair-raising for the founders, because they mightend up with nothing.  When someone\\'s offering to buy you for a priceat which your stock is worth $5 million, saying no is equivalentto having $5 million and betting it all on one spin of the roulettewheel.Investors will tell you the company is worth more.  And they maybe right.  But that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s wrong to sell.  Any financialadvisor who put all his client\\'s assets in the stock of a single,private company would probably lose his license for it.More and more, investors are letting founders cash out partially.That should correct the problem. Most founders have such low standardsthat they\\'ll feel rich with a sum that doesn\\'t seem huge to investors.But this custom is spreading too slowly, because VCs are afraid ofseeming irresponsible.  No one wants to be the first VC to givesomeone fuck-you money and then actually get told \"fuck you.\" Butuntil this does start to happen, we know VCs are being too conservative.19. Investors vary greatly.Back when I was a founder I used to think all VCs were the same.And in fact they do alllookthe same.  They\\'re all what hackerscall \"suits.\"  But since I\\'ve been dealing with VCs more I\\'ve learnedthat some suits are smarter than others.They\\'re also in a business where winners tend to keep winning andlosers to keep losing.  When a VC firm has been successful in thepast, everyone wants funding from them, so they get the pick of allthe new deals.  The self-reinforcing nature of the venture fundingmarket means that the top ten firms live in a completely differentworld from, say, the hundredth.  As well as being smarter, theytend to be calmer and more upstanding; they don\\'t need to do iffythings to get an edge, and don\\'t want to because they have morebrand to protect.There are only two kinds of VCs you want to take money from, if youhave the luxury of choosing: the \"top tier\" VCs, meaning about thetop 20 or so firms, plus a few new ones that are not among the top20 only because they haven\\'t been around long enough.It\\'s particularly important to raise money from a top firm if you\\'rea hacker, because they\\'re more confident.  That means they\\'re lesslikely to stick you with a business guy as CEO, like VCs used todo in the 90s.  If you seem smart and want to do it, they\\'ll letyou run the company.20. Investors don\\'t realize how much it costs to raise money fromthem.Raising money is a huge time suck at just the point where startupscan least afford it. It\\'s not unusual for it to take five or sixmonths to close a funding round.  Six weeks is fast.  And raisingmoney is not just something you can leave running as a backgroundprocess.  When you\\'re raising money, it\\'s inevitably the main focusof the company.  Which means building the product isn\\'t.Suppose a Y Combinator company starts talking to VCs after demoday, and is successful in raising money from them, closing the dealafter a comparatively short 8 weeks.  Since demo day occurs after10 weeks, the company is now 18 weeks old.  Raising money, ratherthan working on the product, has been the company\\'s main focus for44% of its existence.  And mind you, this an example where thingsturned outwell.When a startup does return to working on the product after a fundinground finally closes, it\\'s as if they were returning to work aftera months-long illness.  They\\'ve lost most of their momentum.Investors have no idea how much they damage the companies theyinvest in by taking so long to do it.  But companies do. So thereis a big opportunity here for a new kind of venture fund that investssmaller amounts at lower valuations, but promises to either closeor say no very quickly.  If there were such a firm, I\\'d recommendit to startups in preference to any other, no matter how prestigious.Startups live on speed and momentum.21. Investors don\\'t like to say no.The reason funding deals take so long to close is mainly thatinvestors can\\'t make up their minds.  VCs are not big companies;they can do a deal in 24 hours if they need to.  But they usuallylet the initial meetings stretch out over a couple weeks.  Thereason is the selection algorithm I mentioned earlier.  Most don\\'ttry to predict whether a startup will win, but to notice quicklythat it already is winning.  They care what the market thinks ofyou and what other VCs think of you, and they can\\'t judge thosejust from meeting you.Because they\\'re investing in things that (a) change fast and (b)they don\\'t understand, a lot of investors will reject you in a waythat can later be claimed not to have been a rejection.  Unless youknow this world, you may not even realize you\\'ve been rejected.Here\\'s a VC saying no:We\\'re really excited about your project, and we want to keep in  close touch as you develop it further.Translated into more straightforward language, this means: We\\'renot investing in you, but we may change our minds if it looks likeyou\\'re taking off.  Sometimes they\\'re more candid and say explicitlythat they need to \"see some traction.\"  They\\'ll invest in you ifyou start to get lots of users.  But so would any VC.  So all they\\'resaying is that you\\'re still at square 1.Here\\'s a test for deciding whether a VC\\'s response was yes or no.Look down at your hands.  Are you holding a termsheet?22. You need investors.Some founders say \"Who needs investors?\"  Empirically the answerseems to be: everyone who wants to succeed.  Practically everysuccessful startup takes outside investment at some point.Why? What the people who think they don\\'t need investors forget isthat they will have competitors.  The question is not whether youneedoutside investment, but whether it could help you at all.If the answer is yes, and you don\\'t take investment, then competitorswho do will have an advantage over you.  And in the startup worlda little advantage can expand into a lot.Mike Moritz famously said that he invested in Yahoo because hethought they had a few weeks\\' lead over their competitors.  Thatmay not have mattered quite so much as he thought, because Googlecame along three years later and kicked Yahoo\\'s ass.  But there issomething in what he said.  Sometimes a small lead can grow intothe yes half of a binary choice.Maybe as it gets cheaper to start a startup, it will start to bepossible to succeed in a competitive market without outside funding.  There are certainlycosts to raising money.  But as of this writing the empiricalevidence says it\\'s a net win.23. Investors like it when you don\\'t need them.A lot of founders approach investors as if they needed theirpermission to start a company—as if it were like getting intocollege.  But you don\\'t need investors to start most companies;they just make it easier.And in fact, investors greatly prefer it if you don\\'t need them.What excites them, both consciously and unconsciously, is the sortof startup that approaches them saying \"the train\\'s leaving thestation; are you in or out?\" not the one saying \"please can we havesome money to start a company?\"Most investors are \"bottoms\" in the sense that the startups theylike most are those that are rough with them.  When Google stuckKleiner and Sequoia with a $75 million premoney valuation, theirreaction was probably \"Ouch! That feels so good.\" And they wereright, weren\\'t they?  That deal probably made them more than anyother they\\'ve done.The thing is, VCs are pretty good at reading people.  So don\\'t tryto act tough with them unless you really are the next Google, orthey\\'ll see through you in a second.  Instead of acting tough, whatmost startups should do is simply always have a backup plan.  Alwayshave some alternative plan for getting started if any given investorsays no.  Having one is the best insurance against needing one.So you shouldn\\'t start a startup that\\'s expensive to start, becausethen you\\'ll be at the mercy of investors.  If you ultimately wantto do something that will cost a lot, start by doing a cheapersubset of it, and expand your ambitions when and if you raise moremoney.Apparently the most likely animals to be left alive after a nuclearwar are cockroaches, because they\\'re so hard to kill.  That\\'s whatyou want to be as a startup, initially.  Instead of a beautifulbut fragile flower that needs to have its stem in a plastic tubeto support itself, better to be small, ugly, and indestructible.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.October 2009(This  essay is derived from a talk at the 2009 Startup School.)I wasn\\'t sure what to talk about at Startup School, so I decidedto ask the founders of the startups we\\'d funded.  What hadn\\'t Iwritten about yet?I\\'m in the unusual position of being able to test the essays I writeabout startups.  I hope the ones on other topics are right, but Ihave no way to test them.  The ones on startups get tested by about70 people every 6 months.So I sent all the founders an email asking what surprised them aboutstarting a startup.  This amounts to asking what I got wrong, becauseif I\\'d explained things well enough, nothing should have surprisedthem.I\\'m proud to report I got one response saying:What surprised me the most is that everything was actually    fairly predictable!The bad news is that I got over 100 other responses listing thesurprises they encountered.There were very clear patterns in the responses; it was remarkablehow often several people had been surprised by exactly the samething.  These were the biggest:1. Be Careful with CofoundersThis was the surprise mentioned by the most founders.  There weretwo types of responses: that you have to be careful who you pickas a cofounder, and that you have to work hard to maintain yourrelationship.What people wished they\\'d paid more attention to when choosingcofounders was character and commitment, not ability.  This wasparticularly true with startups that failed.  The lesson: don\\'tpick cofounders who will flake.Here\\'s a typical reponse:You haven\\'t seen someone\\'s true colors unless you\\'ve worked    with them on a startup.The reason character is so important is that it\\'s tested moreseverely than in most other situations.  One founder said explicitlythat the relationship between founders was more important thanability:I would rather cofound a startup with a friend than a stranger    with higher output.  Startups are so hard and emotional that    the bonds and emotional and social support that come with    friendship outweigh the extra output lost.We learned this lesson a long time ago.  If you look at the YCapplication, there are more questions about the commitment andrelationship of the founders than their ability.Founders of successful startups talked less about choosing cofoundersand more about how hard they worked to maintain their relationship.One thing that surprised me is how the relationship of startup    founders goes from a friendship to a marriage.  My relationship    with my cofounder went from just being friends to seeing each    other all the time, fretting over the finances and cleaning up    shit. And the startup was our baby.  I summed it up once like    this: \"It\\'s like we\\'re married, but we\\'re not fucking.\"Several people used that word \"married.\"  It\\'s a far more intenserelationship than you usually see between coworkers—partly becausethe stresses are so much greater, and partly because at first thefounders are the whole company.  So this relationship has to bebuilt of top quality materials and carefully maintained.  It\\'s thebasis of everything.2. Startups Take Over Your LifeJust as the relationship between cofounders is more intense thanit usually is between coworkers, so is the relationship between thefounders and the company.  Running a startup is not like having ajob or being a student, because it never stops.  This is so foreignto most people\\'s experience that they don\\'t get it till it happens.I didn\\'t realize I would spend almost every waking moment either    working or thinking about our startup.  You enter a whole    different way of life when it\\'s your company vs. working for    someone else\\'s company.It\\'s exacerbated by the fast pace of startups, which makes it seemlike time slows down:I think the thing that\\'s been most surprising to me is how one\\'s    perspective on time shifts. Working on our startup, I remember    time seeming to stretch out, so that a month was a huge interval.In the best case, total immersion can be exciting:It\\'s surprising how much you become consumed by your startup,    in that you think about it day and night, but never once does    it feel like \"work.\"Though I have to say, that quote is from someone we funded thissummer.  In a couple years he may not sound so chipper.3. It\\'s an Emotional Roller-coasterThis was another one lots of people were surprised about.  The upsand downs were more extreme than they were prepared for.In a startup, things seem great one moment and hopeless the next.And by next, I mean a couple hours later.The emotional ups and downs were the biggest surprise for me.    One day, we\\'d think of ourselves as the next Google and dream    of buying islands; the next, we\\'d be pondering how to let our    loved ones know of our utter failure; and on and on.The hard part, obviously, is the lows.  For a lot of founders thatwas the big surprise:How hard it is to keep everyone motivated during rough days or    weeks, i.e. how low the lows can be.After a while, if you don\\'t have significant success to cheer youup, it wears you out:Your most basic advice to founders is \"just don\\'t die,\" but the    energy to keep a company going in lieu of unburdening success    isn\\'t free; it is siphoned from the founders themselves.There\\'s a limit to how much you can take.  If you get to the pointwhere you can\\'t keep working anymore, it\\'s not the end of the world.Plenty of famous founders have had some failures along the way.4. It Can Be FunThe good news is, the highs are also very high.  Several founderssaid what surprised them most about doing a startup was how fun itwas:I think you\\'ve left out just how fun it is to do a startup. I    am more fulfilled in my work than pretty much any of my friends    who did not start companies.What they like most is the freedom:I\\'m surprised by how much better it feels to be working on    something that is challenging and creative, something I believe    in, as opposed to the hired-gun stuff I was doing before.  I    knew it would feel better; what\\'s surprising is how much better.Frankly, though, if I\\'ve misled people here, I\\'m not eager to fixthat.  I\\'d rather have everyone think starting a startup is grimand hard than have founders go into it expecting it to be fun, anda few months later saying \"This is supposed to befun? Are youkidding?\"The truth is, it wouldn\\'t be fun for most people.  A lot of whatwe try to do in the application process is to weed out the peoplewho wouldn\\'t like it, both for our sake and theirs.The best way to put it might be that starting a startup is fun theway a survivalist training course would be fun, if you\\'re into thatsort of thing.  Which is to say, not at all, if you\\'re not.5. Persistence Is the KeyA lot of founders were surprised how important persistence was instartups. It was both a negative and a positive surprise: they weresurprised both by the degree of persistence requiredEveryone said how determined and resilient you must be, but    going through it made me realize that the determination required    was still understated.and also by the degree to which persistence alone was able todissolve obstacles:If you are persistent, even problems that seem out of your    control (i.e. immigration) seem to work themselves out.Several founders mentioned specifically how much more importantpersistence was than intelligence.I\\'ve been surprised again and again by just how much more    important persistence is than raw intelligence.This applies not just to intelligence but to ability in general,and that\\'s why so many people said character was more important inchoosing cofounders.6. Think Long-TermYou need persistence because everything takes longer than you expect.A lot of people were surprised by that.I\\'m continually surprised by how long everything can take.    Assuming your product doesn\\'t experience the explosive growth    that very few products do, everything from development to    dealmaking (especially dealmaking) seems to take 2-3x longer    than I always imagine.One reason founders are surprised is that because they work fast,they expect everyone else to.   There\\'s a shocking amount of shearstress at every point where a startup touches a more bureaucraticorganization, like a big company or a VC fund.  That\\'s why fundraisingand the enterprise market kill and maim so many startups.But I think the reason most founders are surprised by how long ittakes is that they\\'re overconfident.  They think they\\'re going tobe an instant success, like YouTube or Facebook.  You tell themonly 1 out of 100 successful startups has a trajectory like that,and they all think \"we\\'re going to be that 1.\"Maybe they\\'ll listen to one of the more successful founders:The top thing I didn\\'t understand before going into it is that    persistence is the name of the game. For the vast majority of    startups that become successful, it\\'s going to be areallylong journey, at least 3 years and probably 5+.There is a positive side to thinking longer-term.  It\\'s not justthat you have to resign yourself to everything taking longer thanit should.  If you work patiently it\\'s less stressful, and you cando better work:Because we\\'re relaxed, it\\'s so much easier to have fun doing    what we do. Gone is the awkward nervous energy fueled by the    desperate need to not fail guiding our actions. We can concentrate    on doing what\\'s best for our company, product, employees and    customers.That\\'s why things get so much better when you hit ramen profitability.You can shift into a different mode of working.7. Lots of Little ThingsWe often emphasize how rarely startups win simply because they hiton some magic idea.  I think founders have now gotten that intotheir heads.  But a lot were surprised to find this also applieswithin startups.  You have to do lots of different things:It\\'s much more of a grind than glamorous. A timeslice selected    at random would more likely find me tracking down a weird DLL    loading bug on Swedish Windows, or tracking down a bug in the    financial model Excel spreadsheet the night before a board    meeting, rather than having brilliant flashes of strategic    insight.Most hacker-founders would like to spend all their time programming.You won\\'t get to, unless you fail.  Which can be transformed into:If you spend all your time programming, you will fail.The principle extends even into programming.  There is rarely asingle brilliant hack that ensures success:I learnt never to bet on any one feature or deal or anything    to bring you success. It is never a single thing.  Everything    is just incremental and you just have to keep doing lots of    those things until you strike something.Even in the rare cases where a clever hack makes your fortune, youprobably won\\'t know till later:There is no such thing as a killer feature. Or at least you    won\\'t know what it is.So the best strategy is to try lots of different things.  The reasonnot to put all your eggs in one basket is not the usual one,which applies even when you know which basket is best.  In a startupyou don\\'t even know that.8. Start with Something MinimalLots of founders mentioned how important it was to launch with thesimplest possible thing.  By this point everyone knows you shouldrelease fast and iterate.  It\\'s practically a mantra at YC.  Buteven so a lot of people seem to have been burned by not doing it:Build the absolute smallest thing that can be considered a    complete application and ship it.Why do people take too long on the first version?  Pride, mostly.They hate to release something that could be better.  They worrywhat people will say about them.  But you have to overcome this:Doing something \"simple\" at first glance does not mean you    aren\\'t doing something meaningful, defensible, or valuable.Don\\'t worry what people will say.  If your first version is soimpressive that trolls don\\'t make fun of it, you waited too longto launch.One founder said this should be your approach to all programming,not just startups, and I tend to agree.Now, when coding, I try to think \"How can I write this such    that if people saw my code, they\\'d be amazed at how little there    is and how little it does?\"Over-engineering is poison.  It\\'s not like doing extra work forextra credit.  It\\'s more like telling a lie that you then have toremember so you don\\'t contradict it.9. Engage UsersProduct development is a conversation with the user that doesn\\'treally start till you launch.  Before you launch, you\\'re like apolice artist before he\\'s shown the first version of his sketch tothe witness.It\\'s so important to launch fast that it may be better to think ofyour initial version not as a product, but as a trick for gettingusers to start talking to you.I learned to think about the initial stages of a startup as a    giant experiment. All products should be considered experiments,    and those that have a market show promising results extremely    quickly.Once you start talking to users, I guarantee you\\'ll be surprisedby what they tell you.When you let customers tell you what they\\'re after, they will    often reveal amazing details about what they find valuable as    well what they\\'re willing to pay for.The surprise is generally positive as well as negative. They won\\'tlike what you\\'ve built, but there will be other things they wouldlike that would be trivially easy to implement.  It\\'s not till youstart the conversation by launching the wrong thing that they canexpress (or perhaps even realize) what they\\'re looking for.10. Change Your IdeaTo benefit from engaging with users you have to be willing to changeyour idea.  We\\'ve always encouraged founders to see a startup ideaas a hypothesis rather than a blueprint.  And yet they\\'re stillsurprised how well it works to change the idea.Normally if you complain about something being hard, the general    advice is to work harder.  With a startup, I think you should    find a problem that\\'s easy for you to solve.  Optimizing in    solution-space is familiar and straightforward, but you can    make enormous gains playing around in problem-space.Whereas mere determination, without flexibility, is a greedy algorithmthat may get you nothing more than a mediocre local maximum:When someone is determined, there\\'s still a danger that they\\'ll    follow a long, hard path that ultimately leads nowhere.You want to push forward, but at the same time twist and turn tofind the most promising path.  One founder put it very succinctly:Fast iteration is the key to success.One reason this advice is so hard to follow is that people don\\'trealize how hard it is to judge startup ideas, particularly theirown.  Experienced founders learn to keep an open mind:Now I don\\'t laugh at ideas anymore, because I realized how    terrible I was at knowing if they were good or not.You can never tell what will work.  You just have to do whateverseems best at each point.  We do this with YC itself.  We stilldon\\'t know if it will work, but it seems like a decent hypothesis.11. Don\\'t Worry about CompetitorsWhen you think you\\'ve got a great idea, it\\'s sort of like having aguilty conscience about something.  All someone has to do is lookat you funny, and you think \"Oh my God,they know.\"These alarms are almost always false:Companies that seemed like competitors and threats at first    glance usually never were when you really looked at it. Even    if they were operating in the same area, they had a different    goal.One reason people overreact to competitors is that they overvalueideas.  If ideas really were the key, a competitor with the sameidea would be a real threat.  But it\\'s usually execution thatmatters:All the scares induced by seeing a new competitor pop up are    forgotten weeks later. It always comes down to your own product    and approach to the market.This is generally true even if competitors get lots of attention.Competitors riding on lots of good blogger perception aren\\'t    really the winners and can disappear from the map quickly.  You    need consumers after all.Hype doesn\\'t make satisfied users, at least not for something ascomplicated as technology.12. It\\'s Hard to Get UsersA lot of founders complained about how hard it was to get users,though.I had no idea how much time and effort needed to go into attaining    users.This is a complicated topic.  When you can\\'t get users, it\\'s hardto say whether the problem is lack of exposure, or whether theproduct\\'s simply bad.  Even good products can be blocked by switchingor integration costs:Getting people to use a new service is incredibly difficult.    This is especially true for a service that other companies can    use, because it requires their developers to do work. If you\\'re    small, they don\\'t think it is urgent.The sharpest criticism of YC came from a founder who said we didn\\'tfocus enough on customer acquisition:YC preaches \"make something people want\" as an engineering task,    a never ending stream of feature after feature until enough    people are happy and the application takes off.  There\\'s very    little focus on the cost of customer acquisition.This may be true; this may be something we need to fix, especiallyfor applications like games.  If you make something where thechallenges are mostly technical, you can rely on word of mouth,like Google did.  One founder was surprised by how well that workedfor him:There is an irrational fear that no one will buy your product.    But if you work hard and incrementally make it better, there    is no need to worry.But with other types of startups you may win less by features andmore by deals and marketing.13. Expect the Worst with DealsDeals fall through.  That\\'s a constant of the startup world.  Startupsare powerless, and good startup ideas generally seem wrong.  Soeveryone is nervous about closing deals with you, and you have noway to make them.This is particularly true with investors:In retrospect, it would have been much better if we had operated    under the assumption that we would never get any additional    outside investment.  That would have focused us on finding    revenue streams early.My advice is generally pessimistic.  Assume you won\\'t get money,and if someone does offer you any, assume you\\'ll never get any more.If someone offers you money, take it. You say it a lot, but I    think it needs even more emphasizing.  We had the opportunity    to raise a lot more money than we did last year and I wish we    had.Why do founders ignore me?  Mostly because they\\'re optimistic bynature.  The mistake is to be optimistic about things you can\\'tcontrol. By all means be optimistic about your ability to makesomething great.  But you\\'re asking for trouble if you\\'re optimisticabout big companies or investors.14. Investors Are CluelessA lot of founders mentioned how surprised they were by the cluelessnessof investors:They don\\'t even know about the stuff they\\'ve invested in.  I    met some investors that had invested in a hardware device and    when I asked them to demo the device they had difficulty switching    it on.Angels are a bit better than VCs, because they usually have startupexperience themselves:VC investors don\\'t know half the time what they are talking    about and are years behind in their thinking.  A few were great,    but 95% of the investors we dealt with were unprofessional,    didn\\'t seem to be very good at business or have any kind of    creative vision. Angels were generally much better to talk to.Why are founders surprised that VCs are clueless?  I think it\\'sbecause they seem so formidable.The reason VCs seem formidable is that it\\'s their profession to.You get to be a VC by convincing asset managers to trust you withhundreds of millions of dollars.  How do you do that?  You have toseem confident, and you have to seem like you understand technology.15. You May Have to Play GamesBecause investors are so bad at judging you, you have to work harderthan you should at selling yourself. One founder said the thingthat surprised him most wasThe degree to which feigning certitude impressed investors.This is the thing that has surprisedmemost about YC founders\\'experiences.  This summer we invited some of the alumni to talk tothe new startups about fundraising, and pretty much 100% of theiradvice was about investor psychology.  I thought I was cynical aboutVCs, but the founders were much more cynical.A lot of what startup founders do is just posturing.  It works.VCs themselves have no idea of the extent to which the startupsthey like are the ones that are best at selling themselves to VCs.It\\'s exactly the same phenomenon we saw a step earlier.  VCs getmoney by seeming confident to LPs, and founders get money by seemingconfident to VCs.16. Luck Is a Big FactorWith two such random linkages in the path between startups andmoney, it shouldn\\'t be surprising that luck is a big factor indeals.  And yet a lot of founders are surprised by it.I didn\\'t realize how much of a role luck plays and how much is    outside of our control.If you think about famous startups, it\\'s pretty clear how big arole luck plays.  Where would Microsoft be if IBM insisted on anexclusive license for DOS?Why are founders fooled by this?  Business guys probably aren\\'t,but hackers are used to a world where skill is paramount, and youget what you deserve.When we started our startup, I had bought the hype of the startup    founder dream: that this is a game of skill. It is, in some    ways.  Having skill is valuable. So is being determined as all    hell. But being lucky is the critical ingredient.Actually the best model would be to say that the outcome is theproductof skill, determination, and luck.  No matter how muchskill and determination you have, if you roll a zero for luck, theoutcome is zero.These quotes about luck are not from founders whose startups failed.Founders who fail quickly tend to blame themselves.  Founders whosucceed quickly don\\'t usually realize how lucky they were.  It\\'sthe ones in the middle who see how important luck is.17. The Value of CommunityA surprising number of founders said what surprised them most aboutstarting a startup was the value of community.  Some meant themicro-community of YC founders:The immense value of the peer group of YC companies, and facing    similar obstacles at similar times.which shouldn\\'t be that surprising, because that\\'s why it\\'s structuredthat way.  Others were surprised at the value of the startup communityin the larger sense:How advantageous it is to live in Silicon Valley, where you    can\\'t help but hear all the cutting-edge tech and startup news,    and run into useful people constantly.The specific thing that surprised them most was the general spiritof benevolence:One of the most surprising things I saw was the willingness of    people to help us. Even people who had nothing to gain went out    of their way to help our startup succeed.and particularly how it extended all the way to the top:The surprise for me was how accessible important and interesting    people are. It\\'s amazing how easily you can reach out to people    and get immediate feedback.This is one of the reasons I like being part of this world.  Creatingwealth is not a zero-sum game, so you don\\'t have to stab people inthe back to win.18. You Get No RespectThere was one surprise founders mentioned that I\\'d forgotten about:that outside the startup world, startup founders get no respect.In social settings, I found that I got a lot more respect when    I said, \"I worked on Microsoft Office\" instead of \"I work at a    small startup you\\'ve never heard of called x.\"Partly this is because the rest of the world just doesn\\'t getstartups, and partly it\\'s yet another consequence of the fact thatmost good startup ideas seem bad:If you pitch your idea to a random person, 95% of the time    you\\'ll find the person instinctively thinks the idea will be a    flop and you\\'re wasting your time (although they probably won\\'t    say this directly).Unfortunately this extends even to dating:It surprised me that being a startup founder does not get you    more admiration from women.I did know about that, but I\\'d forgotten.19. Things Change as You GrowThe last big surprise founders mentioned is how much things changedas they grew.  The biggest change was that you got to program evenless:Your job description as technical founder/CEO is completely    rewritten every 6-12 months. Less coding, more    managing/planning/company building, hiring, cleaning up messes,    and generally getting things in place for what needs to happen    a few months from now.In particular, you now have to deal with employees, who often havedifferent motivations:I knew the founder equation and had been focused on it since I    knew I wanted to start a startup as a 19 year old.  The employee    equation is quite different so it took me a while to get it    down.Fortunately, it can become a lot less stressful once you reachcruising altitude:I\\'d say 75% of the stress is gone now from when we first started.    Running a business is so much more enjoyable now.  We\\'re more    confident. We\\'re more patient. We fight less. We sleep more.I wish I could say it was this way for every startup that succeeded,but 75% is probably on the high side.The Super-PatternThere were a few other patterns, but these were the biggest.  One\\'sfirst thought when looking at them all is to ask if there\\'s asuper-pattern, a pattern to the patterns.I saw it immediately, and so did a YC founder I read the list to.These are supposed to be the surprises, the things I didn\\'t tellpeople.  What do they all have in common?  They\\'re all things Itell people.  If I wrote a new essay with the same outline as thisthat wasn\\'t summarizing the founders\\' responses, everyone would sayI\\'d run out of ideas and was just repeating myself.What is going on here?When I look at the responses, the common theme is thatstarting a startup was like I said, but way more so.  People justdon\\'t seem to get how different it is till they do it.  Why?  Thekey to that mystery is to ask, how differentfrom what?Once youphrase it that way, the answer is obvious: from a job.  Everyone\\'smodel of work is a job.  It\\'s completely pervasive.  Even if you\\'venever had a job, your parents probably did, along with practicallyevery other adult you\\'ve met.Unconsciously, everyone expects a startup to be like a job, andthat explains most of the surprises.  It explains why people aresurprised how carefully you have to choose cofounders and how hardyou have to work to maintain your relationship.  You don\\'t have todo that with coworkers.  It explains why the ups and downs aresurprisingly extreme.  In a job there is much more damping.  Butit also explains why the good times are surprisingly good: mostpeople can\\'t imagine such freedom.  As you go down the list, almostall the surprises are surprising in how much a startup differs froma job.You probably can\\'t overcome anything so pervasive as the model ofwork you grew up with.  So the best solution is to be consciouslyaware of that.  As you go into a startup, you\\'ll be thinking \"everyonesays it\\'s really extreme.\"  Your next thought will probably be \"butI can\\'t believe it will be that bad.\"  If you want to avoid beingsurprised, the next thought after that should be: \"and the reasonI can\\'t believe it will be that bad is that my model of work is ajob.\"'},\n",

Instead of developing a product for some big companyin the expectation of getting job security in return, we developthe product ourselves, in a startup, and sell it to the big company.At the very least we want options.Among other things, this shift has created the appearance of a rapidincrease in economic inequality.  But really the two cases are notas different as they look in economic statistics.Economic statistics are misleading because they ignore the valueof safe jobs.  An easy job from which one can\\'t be fired is worthmoney; exchanging the two is one of the commonest forms ofcorruption.  A sinecure is, in effect, an annuity.  Except sinecuresdon\\'t appear in economic statistics.  If they did, it would be clearthat in practice socialist countries have nontrivial disparitiesof wealth, because they usually have a class of powerful bureaucratswho are paid mostly by seniority and can never be fired.While not a sinecure, a position on the corporate ladder was genuinelyvaluable, because big companies tried not to fire people, andpromoted from within based largely on seniority.  A position on thecorporate ladder had a value analogous to the \"goodwill\" that is avery real element in the valuation of companies.  It meant one couldexpect future high paying jobs.One of main causes of the decay of the corporate ladder is the trendfor takeovers that began in the 1980s.  Why waste your time climbinga ladder that might disappear before you reach the top?And, by no coincidence, the corporate ladder was one of the reasonsthe early corporate raiders were so successful.  It\\'s not onlyeconomic statistics that ignore the value of safe jobs.  Corporatebalance sheets do too.  One reason it was profitable to carve up 1980scompanies and sell them for parts was that they hadn\\'t formallyacknowledged their implicit debt to employees who had done goodwork and expected to be rewarded with high-paying executive jobswhen their time came.In the movieWall Street, Gordon Gekkoridicules a company overloaded with vice presidents.  But the companymay not be as corrupt as it seems; those VPs\\' cushy jobs wereprobably payment for work done earlier.I like the new model better.  For one thing, it seems a bad planto treat jobs as rewards.  Plenty of good engineers got made intobad managers that way.  And the old system meant people had to dealwith a lot more corporate politics, in order to protect the workthey\\'d invested in a position on the ladder.The big disadvantage of the new system is that it involves morerisk.  If you develop ideas in a startup insteadof within a big company, any number of random factors could sinkyou before you can finish.  But maybe the older generation wouldlaugh at me for saying that the way we do things is riskier.  Afterall, projects within big companies were always getting cancelledas a result of arbitrary decisions from higher up.  My father\\'sentire industry (breeder reactors) disappeared that way.For better or worse, the idea of the corporate ladder is probablygone for good.

       "  'essay_text': \"Get funded byY Combinator.October 2011If you look at a list of US cities sorted by population, the numberof successful startups per capita varies by orders of magnitude.Somehow it's as if most places were sprayed with startupicide.I wondered about this for years.  I could see the average town waslike a roach motel for startup ambitions: smart, ambitious peoplewent in, but no startups came out.  But I was never able to figureout exactly what happened inside the motel—exactly what waskilling all the potential startups.A couple weeks ago I finally figured it out. I was framing thequestion wrong.  The problem is not that most towns kill startups.It's that death is thedefaultfor startups,and most towns don't save them.  Instead of thinking of most placesas being sprayed with startupicide, it's more accurate to think ofstartups as all being poisoned, and a few places being sprayed withthe antidote.Startups in other places are just doing what startups naturally do:fail.  The real question is, what'ssavingstartups in placeslike Silicon Valley?EnvironmentI think there are two components to the antidote: being in a placewhere startups are the cool thing to do, and chance meetings withpeople who can help you.  And what drives them both is the numberof startup people around you.The first component is particularly helpful in the first stage ofa startup's life, when you go from merely having an interest instarting a company to actually doing it.  It's quite a leap to starta startup.  It's an unusual thing to do. But in Silicon Valley itseems normal.In most places, if you start a startup, people treat you as ifyou're unemployed.  People in the Valley aren't automaticallyimpressed with you just because you're starting a company, but theypay attention.  Anyone who's been here any amount of time knows notto default to skepticism, no matter how inexperienced you seem orhow unpromising your idea sounds at first, because they've all seeninexperienced founders with unpromising sounding ideas who a fewyears later were billionaires.Having people around you care about what you're doing is anextraordinarilypowerfulforce.  Even themost willful people are susceptible to it.  About a year after westarted Y Combinator I said something to a partner at a well knownVC firm that gave him the (mistaken) impression I was consideringstarting another startup.  He responded so eagerly that for abouthalf a second I found myself considering doing it.In most other cities, the prospect of starting a startup just doesn'tseem real.  In the Valley it's not only real but fashionable.  Thatno doubt causes a lot of people to start startups who shouldn't.But I think that's ok.  Few people are suited to running a startup,and it's very hard to predict beforehand which are (as I know alltoo well from being in the business of trying to predict beforehand),so lots of people starting startups who shouldn't is probably theoptimal state of affairs.  As long as you're at a point in yourlife when you can bear the risk of failure, the best way to findout if you're suited to running a startup is totryit.ChanceThe second component of the antidote is chance meetings with peoplewho can help you.  This force works in both phases: both in thetransition from the desire to start a startup to starting one, andthe transition from starting a company to succeeding.  The powerof chance meetings is more variable than people around you caringabout startups, which is like a sort of background radiation thataffects everyone equally, but at its strongest it is far stronger.Chance meetings produce miracles to compensate for the disastersthat characteristically befall startups.  In the Valley, terriblethings happen to startups all the time, just like they do to startupseverywhere.  The reason startups are more likely to make it hereis that great things happen to them too.  In the Valley, lightninghas a sign bit.For example, you start a site for college students and you decideto move to the Valley for the summer to work on it.  And then on arandom suburban street in Palo Alto you happen to run into SeanParker, who understands the domain really well because he starteda similar startup himself, and also knows all the investors.  Andmoreover has advanced views, for 2004, on founders retainingcontrolof their companies.You can't say precisely what the miracle will be, or even for surethat one will happen.  The best one can say is: if you're in astartup hub, unexpected good things will probably happen to you,especially if you deserve them.I bet this is true even for startups we fund.  Even with us workingto make things happen for them on purpose rather than by accident,the frequency of helpful chance meetings in the Valley is so highthat it's still a significant increment on what we can deliver.Chance meetings play a role like the role relaxation plays in havingideas.  Most people have had the experience of working hard on someproblem, not being able to solve it, giving up and going to bed,and then thinking of the answer in the shower in the morning.  Whatmakes the answer appear is letting your thoughtsdrifta bit—and thus drift off the wrongpath you'd been pursuing last night and onto the right one adjacentto it.Chance meetings let your acquaintance drift in the same way takinga shower lets your thoughts drift. The critical thing in both casesis that they drift just the right amount.  The meeting between LarryPage and Sergey Brin was a good example.  They let their acquaintancedrift, but only a little; they were both meeting someone they hada lot in common with.For Larry Page the most important component of the antidote wasSergey Brin, and vice versa.  The antidote ispeople.  It's not thephysical infrastructure of Silicon Valley that makes it work, orthe weather, or anything like that.  Those helped get it started,but now that the reaction is self-sustaining what drives it is thepeople.Many observers have noticed that one of the most distinctive thingsabout startup hubs is the degree to which people help one anotherout, with no expectation of getting anything in return.  I'm notsure why this is so.  Perhaps it's because startups are less of azero sum game than most types of business; they are rarely killedby competitors.  Or perhaps it's because so many startup foundershave backgrounds in the sciences, where collaboration is encouraged.A large part of YC's function is to accelerate that process.  We'rea sort of Valley within the Valley, where the density of peopleworking on startups and their willingness to help one another areboth artificially amplified.NumbersBoth components of the antidote—an environment that encouragesstartups, and chance meetings with people who help you—aredriven by the same underlying cause: the number of startup peoplearound you.  To make a startup hub, you need alotof peopleinterested in startups.There are three reasons. The first, obviously, is that if you don'thave enough density, the chance meetings don't happen.The second is that different startups need such different things, soyou need a lot of people to supply each startup with what they needmost.  Sean Parker was exactly what Facebook needed in 2004.  Anotherstartup might have needed a database guy, or someone with connectionsin the movie business.This is one of the reasons we fund such a large number of companies,incidentally.  The bigger the community, the greater the chance itwill contain the person who has that one thing you need most.The third reason you need a lot of people to make a startup hub isthat once you have enough people interested in the same problem,they start to set the social norms.  And it is a particularlyvaluable thing when the atmosphere around you encourages you to dosomething that would otherwise seem too ambitious.  In most placesthe atmosphere pulls you back toward the mean.I flew into the Bay Area a few days ago.  I notice this every timeI fly over the Valley: somehow you can sense something is going on.  Obviously you can sense prosperity in how well kept aplace looks.  But there are different kinds of prosperity.  SiliconValley doesn't look like Boston, or New York, or LA, or DC.  I triedasking myself what word I'd use to describe the feeling the Valleyradiated, and the word that came to mind was optimism.\"},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'One of the most important things I didn\\'t understand about the worldwhen I was a child is the degree to which the returns for performanceare superlinear.Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear.\"You get out,\" I heard a thousand times, \"what you put in.\" Theymeant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only halfas good as your competitor\\'s, you don\\'t get half as many customers.You get no customers, and you go out of business.It\\'s obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinearin business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that ifwe changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinearreturns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifactof rules we\\'ve invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power,military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In allof these, the rich get richer.You can\\'t understand the world without understanding the conceptof superlinear returns. And if you\\'re ambitious you definitelyshould, because this will be the wave you surf on.It may seem as if there are a lot of different situations withsuperlinear returns, but as far as I can tell they reduce to twofundamental causes: exponential growth and thresholds.The most obvious case of superlinear returns is when you\\'re workingon something that grows exponentially. For example, growing bacterialcultures. When they grow at all, they grow exponentially. But they\\'retricky to grow. Which means the difference in outcome between someonewho\\'s adept at it and someone who\\'s not is very great.Startups can also grow exponentially, and we see the same patternthere. Some manage to achieve high growth rates. Most don\\'t. Andas a result you get qualitatively different outcomes: the companieswith high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while theones with lower growth rates may not even survive.Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate ratherthan absolute numbers. It prevents them from being discouraged earlyon, when the absolute numbers are still low. It also helps themdecide what to focus on: you can use growth rate as a compass totell you how to evolve the company. But the main advantage is thatby focusing on growth rate you tend to get something that growsexponentially.YC doesn\\'t explicitly tell founders that with growth rate \"you getout what you put in,\" but it\\'s not far from the truth. And if growthrate were proportional to performance, then the reward for performancepover timetwould be proportional topt.Even after decades of thinking about this, I find that sentencestartling.Whenever how well you do depends on how well you\\'ve done, you\\'llget exponential growth. But neither our DNA nor our customs prepareus for it. No one finds exponential growth natural; every child issurprised, the first time they hear it, by the story of the man whoasks the king for a single grain of rice the first day and doublethe amount each successive day.What we don\\'t understand naturally we develop customs to deal with,but we don\\'t have many customs about exponential growth either,because there have been so few instances of it in human history.In principle herding should have been one: the more animals youhad, the more offspring they\\'d have. But in practice grazing landwas the limiting factor, and there was no plan for growing thatexponentially.Or more precisely, no generally applicable plan. Therewasa wayto grow one\\'s territory exponentially: by conquest. The more territoryyou control, the more powerful your army becomes, and the easierit is to conquer new territory. This is why history is full ofempires. But so few people created or ran empires that theirexperiences didn\\'t affect customs very much. The emperor was aremote and terrifying figure, not a source of lessons one could usein one\\'s own life.The most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial timeswas probably scholarship. The more you know, the easier it is tolearn new things. The result, then as now, was that some peoplewere startlingly more knowledgeable than the rest about certaintopics. But this didn\\'t affect customs much either. Although empiresof ideas can overlap and there can thus be far more emperors, inpreindustrial times this type of empire had little practical effect.That has changed in the last few centuries. Now the emperors ofideas can design bombs that defeat the emperors of territory. Butthis phenomenon is still so new that we haven\\'t fully assimilatedit. Few even of the participants realize they\\'re benefitting fromexponential growth or ask what they can learn from other instancesof it.The other source of superlinear returns is embodied in the expression\"winner take all.\" In a sports match the relationship betweenperformance and return is a step function: the winning team getsone win whether they do much better or just slightly better.The source of the step function is not competition per se, however.It\\'s that there are thresholds in the outcome. You don\\'t needcompetition to get those. There can be thresholds in situationswhere you\\'re the only participant, like proving a theorem or hittinga target.It\\'s remarkable how often a situation with one source of superlinearreturns also has the other. Crossing thresholds leads to exponentialgrowth: the winning side in a battle usually suffers less damage,which makes them more likely to win in the future. And exponentialgrowth helps you cross thresholds: in a market with network effects,a company that grows fast enough can shut out potential competitors.Fame is an interesting example of a phenomenon that combines bothsources of superlinear returns. Fame grows exponentially becauseexisting fans bring you new ones. But the fundamental reason it\\'sso concentrated is thresholds: there\\'s only so much room on theA-list in the average person\\'s head.The most important case combining both sources of superlinear returnsmay be learning. Knowledge grows exponentially, but there are alsothresholds in it. Learning to ride a bicycle, for example. Some ofthese thresholds are akin to machine tools: once you learn to read,you\\'re able to learn anything else much faster. But the most importantthresholds of all are those representing new discoveries. Knowledgeseems to be fractal in the sense that if you push hard at theboundary of one area of knowledge, you sometimes discover a wholenew field. And if you do, you get first crack at all the newdiscoveries to be made in it. Newton did this, and so did Durer andDarwin.Are there general rules for finding situations with superlinearreturns? The most obvious one is to seek work that compounds.There are two ways work can compound. It can compound directly, inthe sense that doing well in one cycle causes you to do better inthe next. That happens for example when you\\'re building infrastructure,or growing an audience or brand. Or work can compound by teachingyou, since learning compounds. This second case is an interestingone because you may feel you\\'re doing badly as it\\'s happening. Youmay be failing to achieve your immediate goal. But if you\\'re learninga lot, then you\\'re getting exponential growth nonetheless.This is one reason Silicon Valley is so tolerant of failure. Peoplein Silicon Valley aren\\'t blindly tolerant of failure. They\\'ll onlycontinue to bet on you if you\\'re learning from your failures. Butif you are, you are in fact a good bet: maybe your company didn\\'tgrow the way you wanted, but you yourself have, and that shouldyield results eventually.Indeed, the forms of exponential growth that don\\'t consist oflearning are so often intermixed with it that we should probablytreat this as the rule rather than the exception. Which yieldsanother heuristic: always be learning. If you\\'re not learning,you\\'re probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns.But don\\'t overoptimizewhatyou\\'re learning. Don\\'t limit yourselfto learning things that are already known to be valuable. You\\'relearning; you don\\'t know for sure yet what\\'s going to be valuable,and if you\\'re too strict you\\'ll lop off the outliers.What about step functions? Are there also useful heuristics of theform \"seek thresholds\" or \"seek competition?\" Here the situationis trickier. The existence of a threshold doesn\\'t guarantee thegame will be worth playing. If you play a round of Russian roulette,you\\'ll be in a situation with a threshold, certainly, but in thebest case you\\'re no better off. \"Seek competition\" is similarlyuseless; what if the prize isn\\'t worth competing for? Sufficientlyfast exponential growth guarantees both the shape and magnitude ofthe return curve — because something that grows fast enough willgrow big even if it\\'s trivially small at first — but thresholdsonly guarantee the shape.A principle for taking advantage of thresholds has to include atest to ensure the game is worth playing. Here\\'s one that does: ifyou come across something that\\'s mediocre yet still popular, itcould be a good idea to replace it. For example, if a company makesa product that people dislike yet still buy, then presumably they\\'dbuy a better alternative if you made one.It would be great if there were a way to find promising intellectualthresholds. Is there a way to tell which questions have whole newfields beyond them? I doubt we could ever predict this with certainty,but the prize is so valuable that it would be useful to havepredictors that were even a little better than random, and there\\'shope of finding those. We can to some degree predict when a researchproblemisn\\'tlikely to lead to new discoveries: when it seemslegit but boring. Whereas the kind that do lead to new discoveriestend to seem very mystifying, but perhaps unimportant. (If theywere mystifying and obviously important, they\\'d be famous openquestions with lots of people already working on them.) So oneheuristic here is to be driven by curiosity rather than careerism— to give free rein to your curiosity instead of working on whatyou\\'re supposed to.The prospect of superlinear returns for performance is an excitingone for the ambitious. And there\\'s good news in this department:this territory is expanding in both directions. There are more typesof work in which you can get superlinear returns, and the returnsthemselves are growing.There are two reasons for this, though they\\'re so closely intertwinedthat they\\'re more like one and a half: progress in technology, andthe decreasing importance of organizations.Fifty years ago it used to be much more necessary to be part of anorganization to work on ambitious projects. It was the only way toget the resources you needed, the only way to have colleagues, andthe only way to get distribution. So in 1970 your prestige was inmost cases the prestige of the organization you belonged to. Andprestige was an accurate predictor, because if you weren\\'t part ofan organization, you weren\\'t likely to achieve much. There were ahandful of exceptions, most notably artists and writers, who workedalone using inexpensive tools and had their own brands. But eventhey were at the mercy of organizations for reaching audiences.A world dominated by organizations damped variation in the returnsfor performance. But this world has eroded significantly just inmy lifetime. Now a lot more people can have the freedom that artistsand writers had in the 20th century. There are lots of ambitiousprojects that don\\'t require much initial funding, and lots of newways to learn, make money, find colleagues, and reach audiences.There\\'s still plenty of the old world left, but the rate of changehas been dramatic by historical standards. Especially consideringwhat\\'s at stake. It\\'s hard to imagine a more fundamental changethan one in the returns for performance.Without the damping effect of institutions, there will be morevariation in outcomes. Which doesn\\'t imply everyone will be betteroff: people who do well will do even better, but those who do badlywill do worse. That\\'s an important point to bear in mind. Exposingoneself to superlinear returns is not for everyone. Most peoplewill be better off as part of the pool. So who should shoot forsuperlinear returns? Ambitious people of two types: those who knowthey\\'re so good that they\\'ll be net ahead in a world with highervariation, and those, particularly the young, who can afford torisk trying it to find out.The switch away from institutions won\\'t simply be an exodus of theircurrent inhabitants. Many of the new winners will be people they\\'dnever have let in. So the resulting democratization of opportunitywill be both greater and more authentic than any tame intramuralversion the institutions themselves might have cooked up.Not everyone is happy about this great unlocking of ambition. Itthreatens some vested interests and contradicts some ideologies.But if you\\'re an ambitious individual it\\'s good news for you.How should you take advantage of it?The most obvious way to take advantage of superlinear returns forperformance is by doing exceptionally good work. At the far end ofthe curve, incremental effort is a bargain. All the more so becausethere\\'s less competition at the far end — and not just for theobvious reason that it\\'s hard to do something exceptionally well,but also because people find the prospect so intimidating that feweven try. Which means it\\'s not just a bargain to do exceptionalwork, but a bargain even to try to.There are many variables that affect how good your work is, and ifyou want to be an outlier you need to get nearly all of them right.For example, to do something exceptionally well, you have to beinterested in it. Mere diligence is not enough. So in a world withsuperlinear returns, it\\'s even more valuable to know what you\\'reinterested in, and to find ways to work on it.It will also beimportant to choose work that suits your circumstances. For example,if there\\'s a kind of work that inherently requires a huge expenditureof time and energy, it will be increasingly valuable to do it whenyou\\'re young and don\\'t yet have children.There\\'s a surprising amount of technique to doing great work.It\\'s not just a matter of trying hard. I\\'m going to take a shotgiving a recipe in one paragraph.Choose work you have a natural aptitude for and a deep interest in.Develop a habit of working on your own projects; it doesn\\'t matterwhat they are so long as you find them excitingly ambitious. Workas hard as you can without burning out, and this will eventuallybring you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. These look smoothfrom a distance, but up close they\\'re full of gaps. Notice andexplore such gaps, and if you\\'re lucky one will expand into a wholenew field. Take as much risk as you can afford; if you\\'re not failingoccasionally you\\'re probably being too conservative. Seek out thebest colleagues. Develop good taste and learn from the best examples.Be honest, especially with yourself. Exercise and eat and sleepwell and avoid the more dangerous drugs. When in doubt, follow yourcuriosity. It never lies, and it knows more than you do about what\\'sworth paying attention to.And there is of course one other thing you need: to be lucky. Luckis always a factor, but it\\'s even more of a factor when you\\'reworking on your own rather than as part of an organization. Andthough there are some valid aphorisms about luck being wherepreparedness meets opportunity and so on, there\\'s also a componentof true chance that you can\\'t do anything about. The solution isto take multiple shots. Which is another reason to start takingrisks early.The best example of a field with superlinear returns is probablyscience. It has exponential growth, in the form of learning, combinedwith thresholds at the extreme edge of performance — literally atthe limits of knowledge.The result has been a level of inequality in scientific discoverythat makes the wealth inequality of even the most stratified societiesseem mild by comparison. Newton\\'s discoveries were arguably greaterthan all his contemporaries\\' combined.This point may seem obvious, but it might be just as well to spellit out. Superlinear returns imply inequality. The steeper the returncurve, the greater the variation in outcomes.In fact, the correlation between superlinear returns and inequalityis so strong that it yields another heuristic for finding work ofthis type: look for fields where a few big winners outperformeveryone else. A kind of work where everyone does about the sameis unlikely to be one with superlinear returns.What are fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else?Here are some obvious ones: sports, politics, art, music, acting,directing, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing.In sports the phenomenon is due to externally imposed thresholds;you only need to be a few percent faster to win every race. Inpolitics, power grows much as it did in the days of emperors. Andin some of the other fields (including politics) success is drivenlargely by fame, which has its own source of superlinear growth.But when we exclude sports and politics and the effects of fame, aremarkable pattern emerges: the remaining list is exactly the sameas the list of fields where you have to beindependent-mindedtosucceed — where your ideas have to be not just correct, but novelas well.This is obviously the case in science. You can\\'t publish paperssaying things that other people have already said. But it\\'s justas true in investing, for example. It\\'s only useful to believe thata company will do well if most other investors don\\'t; if everyoneelse thinks the company will do well, then its stock price willalready reflect that, and there\\'s no room to make money.What else can we learn from these fields? In all of them you haveto put in the initial effort. Superlinear returns seem small atfirst.At this rate,you find yourself thinking,I\\'ll never getanywhere.But because the reward curve rises so steeply at the farend, it\\'s worth taking extraordinary measures to get there.In the startup world, the name for this principle is \"do thingsthat don\\'t scale.\" If you pay a ridiculous amount of attention toyour tiny initial set of customers, ideally you\\'ll kick off exponentialgrowth by word of mouth. But this same principle applies to anythingthat grows exponentially. Learning, for example. When you firststart learning something, you feel lost. But it\\'s worth making theinitial effort to get a toehold, because the more you learn, theeasier it will get.There\\'s another more subtle lesson in the list of fields withsuperlinear returns: not to equate work with a job. For most of the20th century the two were identical for nearly everyone, and as aresult we\\'ve inherited a custom that equates productivity withhaving a job. Even now to most people the phrase \"your work\" meanstheir job. But to a writer or artist or scientist it means whateverthey\\'re currently studying or creating. For someone like that, theirwork is something they carry with them from job to job, if theyhave jobs at all. It may be done for an employer, but it\\'s part oftheir portfolio.It\\'s an intimidating prospect to enter a field where a few bigwinners outperform everyone else. Some people do this deliberately,but you don\\'t need to. If you have sufficient natural ability andyou follow your curiosity sufficiently far, you\\'ll end up in one.Your curiosity won\\'t let you be interested in boring questions, andinteresting questions tend to create fields with superlinear returnsif they\\'re not already part of one.The territory of superlinear returns is by no means static. Indeed,the most extreme returns come from expanding it. So while bothambition and curiosity can get you into this territory, curiositymay be the more powerful of the two. Ambition tends to make youclimb existing peaks, but if you stick close enough to an interestingenough question, it may grow into a mountain beneath you.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'I have too much stuff.  Most people in America do.  In fact, thepoorer people are, the more stuff they seem to have.  Hardly anyoneis so poor that they can\\'t afford a front yard full of old cars.It wasn\\'t always this way.  Stuff used to be rare and valuable.You can still see evidence of that if you look for it.  For example,in my house in Cambridge, which was built in 1876, the bedroomsdon\\'t have closets.  In those days people\\'s stuff fit in a chestof drawers.  Even as recently as a few decades ago there was a lotless stuff.  When I look back at photos from the 1970s, I\\'m surprisedhow empty houses look.  As a kid I had what I thought was a hugefleet of toy cars, but they\\'d be dwarfed by the number of toys mynephews have.  All together my Matchboxes and Corgis took up abouta third of the surface of my bed.  In my nephews\\' rooms the bed isthe only clear space.Stuff has gotten a lot cheaper, but our attitudes toward it haven\\'tchanged correspondingly.  We overvalue stuff.That was a big problemfor me when I had no money.  I felt poor, and stuff seemed valuable,so almost instinctively I accumulated it.  Friends would leavesomething behind when they moved, or I\\'d see something as I waswalking down the street on trash night (beware of anything you findyourself describing as \"perfectly good\"), or I\\'d find something inalmost new condition for a tenth its retail price at a garage sale.And pow, more stuff.In fact these free or nearly free things weren\\'t bargains, becausethey were worth even less than they cost.  Most of the stuff Iaccumulated was worthless, because I didn\\'t need it.What I didn\\'t understand was that the value of some new acquisitionwasn\\'t the difference between its retail price and what I paid forit.  It was the value I derived from it.  Stuff is an extremelyilliquid asset.  Unless you have some plan for selling that valuablething you got so cheaply, what difference does it make what it\\'s\"worth?\"  The only way you\\'re ever going to extract any value fromit is to use it.  And if you don\\'t have any immediate use for it,you probably never will.Companies that sell stuff have spent huge sums training us to thinkstuff is still valuable.  But it would be closer to the truth totreat stuff as worthless.In fact, worse than worthless, because once you\\'ve accumulated acertain amount of stuff, it starts to own you rather than the otherway around.  I know of one couple who couldn\\'t retire to the townthey preferred because they couldn\\'t afford a place there big enoughfor all their stuff.  Their house isn\\'t theirs; it\\'s their stuff\\'s.And unless you\\'re extremely organized, a house full of stuff canbe very depressing. A cluttered room saps one\\'s spirits.  Onereason, obviously, is that there\\'s less room for people in a roomfull of stuff.  But there\\'s more going on than that.  I think humansconstantly scan their environment to build a mental model of what\\'saround them.  And the harder a scene is to parse, the less energyyou have left for conscious thoughts.  A cluttered room is literallyexhausting.(This could explain why clutter doesn\\'t seem to bother kids as muchas adults. Kids are less perceptive.  They build a coarser modelof their surroundings, and this consumes less energy.)I first realized the worthlessness of stuff when I lived in Italyfor a year.  All I took with me was one large backpack of stuff.The rest of my stuff I left in my landlady\\'s attic back in the US.And you know what?  All I missed were some of the books.  By theend of the year I couldn\\'t even remember what else I had stored inthat attic.And yet when I got back I didn\\'t discard so much as a box of it.Throw away a perfectly good rotary telephone?  I might need thatone day.The really painful thing to recall is not just that I accumulatedall this useless stuff, but that I often spent money I desperatelyneeded on stuff that I didn\\'t.Why would I do that?  Because the people whose job is to sell youstuff are really, really good at it.  The average 25 year old isno match for companies that have spent years figuring out how toget you to spend money on stuff.  They make the experience of buyingstuff so pleasant that \"shopping\" becomes a leisure activity.How do you protect yourself from these people?  It can\\'t be easy.I\\'m a fairly skeptical person, and their tricks worked on me wellinto my thirties.  But one thing that might work is to ask yourself,before buying something, \"is this going to make my life noticeablybetter?\"A friend of mine cured herself of a clothes buying habit by askingherself before she bought anything \"Am I going to wear this all thetime?\"  If she couldn\\'t convince herself that something she wasthinking of buying would become one of those few things she woreall the time, she wouldn\\'t buy it.  I think that would work for anykind of purchase.  Before you buy anything, ask yourself: will thisbe something I use constantly?  Or is it just something nice?  Orworse still, a mere bargain?The worst stuff in this respect may be stuff you don\\'t use muchbecause it\\'s too good.  Nothing owns you like fragile stuff.  Forexample, the \"good china\" so many households have, and whose definingquality is not so much that it\\'s fun to use, but that one must beespecially careful not to break it.Another way to resist acquiring stuff is to think of the overallcost of owning it.  The purchase price is just the beginning.  You\\'regoing to have tothinkabout that thing for years—perhaps forthe rest of your life.  Every thing you own takes energy away fromyou.  Some give more than they take.  Those are the only thingsworth having.I\\'ve now stopped accumulating stuff.  Except books—but books aredifferent.  Books are more like a fluid than individual objects.It\\'s not especially inconvenient to own several thousand books,whereas if you owned several thousand random possessions you\\'d bea local celebrity.  But except for books, I now actively avoidstuff.  If I want to spend money on some kind of treat, I\\'ll takeservicesovergoodsany day.I\\'m not claiming this is because I\\'ve achieved some kind of zenlikedetachment from material things.  I\\'m talking about something moremundane.  A historical change has taken place, and I\\'ve now realizedit.  Stuff used to be valuable, and now it\\'s not.In industrialized countries the same thing happened with food inthe middle of the twentieth century.  As food got cheaper (or wegot richer; they\\'re indistinguishable), eating too much started tobe a bigger danger than eating too little.   We\\'ve now reached thatpoint with stuff.  For most people, rich or poor, stuff has becomea burden.The good news is, if you\\'re carrying a burden without knowing it,your life could be better than you realize.  Imagine walking aroundfor years with five pound ankle weights, then suddenly having themremoved.Spanish TranslationRussian TranslationItalian TranslationPolish TranslationTurkish TranslationFrench TranslationSlovak TranslationRomanian TranslationGerman Translation'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'There are some topics I save up because they\\'ll be so much fun towrite about.  This is one of them: a list of my heroes.I\\'m not claiming this is a list of thenmost admirable people.Who could make such a list, even if they wanted to?Einstein isn\\'t on the list, for example, even though he probablydeserves to be on any shortlist of admirable people.  I once askeda physicist friend if Einstein was really as smart as his fameimplies, and she said that yes, he was.  So why isn\\'t he on thelist?  Because I had to ask.  This is a list of people who\\'veinfluenced me, not people who would have if I understood their work.My test was to think of someone and ask \"is this person myhero?\"  It often returned surprising answers.  For example,it returned false for Montaigne, who was arguably the inventor ofthe essay.  Why?  When I thoughtabout what it meant to call someone a hero, it meant I\\'d decide whatto do by asking what they\\'d do in the same situation.  That\\'s a stricter standard than admiration.After I made the list, I looked to see if there was a pattern, andthere was, a very clear one.  Everyone on the list had two qualities:they cared almost excessively about their work, and they wereabsolutely honest.  By honest I don\\'t mean trustworthy so much asthat they never pander: they never say or do something becausethat\\'s what the audience wants.  They are all fundamentally subversivefor this reason, though they conceal it to varying degrees.Jack LambertI grew up in Pittsburgh in the 1970s.  Unless you were there it\\'shard to imagine how that town felt about the Steelers.   Locally,all the news was bad.  The steel industry was dying.  But theSteelers were the best team in football — and moreover, in away that seemed to reflect the personality of the city.  They didn\\'tdo anything fancy.  They just got the job done.Other players were more famous: Terry Bradshaw, Franco Harris, LynnSwann.  But they played offense, and you always get more attentionfor that.  It seemed to me as a twelve year old football expertthat the best of them all wasJack Lambert.  And what made him sogood was that he was utterly relentless.  He didn\\'t just care aboutplaying well; he cared almost too much.  He seemed to regard it asa personal insult when someone from the other team had possessionof the ball on his side of the line of scrimmage.The suburbs of Pittsburgh in the 1970s were a pretty dull place.School was boring.  All the adults around were bored with theirjobs working for big companies. Everything that came to us throughthe mass media was (a) blandly uniform and (b) produced elsewhere.Jack Lambert was the exception.  He was like nothing else I\\'d seen.Kenneth ClarkKenneth Clark is the best nonfiction writer I know of, on anysubject.  Most people who write about art history don\\'t really likeart; you can tell from a thousand little signs.  But Clark did, andnot just intellectually, but the way one anticipates a deliciousdinner.What really makes him stand out, though, is the quality of hisideas.  His style is deceptively casual, but there is more in his books than in a libraryof art monographs.  ReadingThe Nudeis like a ride in aFerrari.  Just as you\\'re getting settled, you\\'re slammed back inyour seat by the acceleration.  Before you can adjust, you\\'re thrownsideways as the car screeches into the first turn.  His brain throwsoff ideas almost too fast to grasp them.  Finally at the end of thechapter you come to a halt, with your eyes wide and a big smile onyour face.Kenneth Clark was a star in his day, thanks to the documentaryseriesCivilisation.  And if you read only one book aboutart history,Civilisationis the one I\\'d recommend.  It\\'smuch better than the drab Sears Catalogs of art that undergraduatesare forced to buy for Art History 101.Larry MihalkoA lot of people have a great teacher at some point in their childhood.Larry Mihalko was mine.  When I look back it\\'s like there\\'s a linedrawn between third and fourth grade.  After Mr. Mihalko, everythingwas different.Why?  First of all, he was intellectually curious.  I had a fewother teachers who were smart, but I wouldn\\'t describe them asintellectually curious.  In retrospect, he was out of place as anelementary school teacher, and I think he knew it.  That must havebeen hard for him, but it was wonderful for us, his students.  Hisclass was a constant adventure.  I used to like going to schoolevery day.The other thing that made him different was that he liked us.  Kidsare good at telling that.  The other teachers were at best benevolentlyindifferent.  But Mr.  Mihalko seemed like he actually wanted tobe our friend.  On the last day of fourth grade, he got out one ofthe heavy school record players and played James Taylor\\'s \"You\\'veGot a Friend\" to us.  Just call out my name, and you know whereverI am, I\\'ll come running.  He died at 59 of lung cancer.  I\\'ve nevercried like I cried at his funeral.LeonardoOne of the things I\\'ve learned about making things that I didn\\'trealize when I was a kid is that much of the best stuff isn\\'t madefor audiences, but for oneself.  You see paintings and drawings inmuseums and imagine they were made for you to look at.  Actually alot of the best ones were made as a way of exploring the world, notas a way to please other people.  The best of these explorationsare sometimes more pleasing than stuff made explicitly to please.Leonardo did a lot of things.  One of his most admirable qualitieswas that he did so many different things that were admirable.  Whatpeople know of him now is his paintings and his more flamboyantinventions, like flying machines.  That makes him seem like somekind of dreamer who sketched artists\\' conceptions of rocket shipson the side.  In fact he made a large number of far more practicaltechnical discoveries.  He was as good an engineer as a painter.His most impressive work, to me, is hisdrawings.  They\\'re clearlymade more as a way of studying the world than producing somethingbeautiful. And yet they can hold their own with any work of artever made.  No one else, before or since, was that good when no onewas looking.Robert MorrisRobert Morris has a very unusual quality: he\\'s never wrong.  Itmight seem this would require you to be omniscient, but actuallyit\\'s surprisingly easy. Don\\'t say anything unless you\\'re fairlysure of it.  If you\\'re not omniscient, you just don\\'t end up sayingmuch.More precisely, the trick is to pay careful attention to how youqualify what you say.  By using this trick, Robert has, as far asI know, managed to be mistaken only once, and that was when he wasan undergrad.  When the Mac came out, he said that little desktopcomputers would never be suitable for real hacking.It\\'s wrong to call it a trick in his case, though.  If it were aconscious trick, he would have slipped in a moment of excitement.With Robert this quality is wired-in.  He has an almost superhumanintegrity.  He\\'s not just generally correct, but also correct abouthow correct he is.You\\'d think it would be such a great thing never to be wrong thateveryone would do this.  It doesn\\'t seem like that much extra workto pay as much attention to the error on an idea as to the ideaitself.  And yet practically no one does.  I know how hard it is,because since meeting Robert I\\'ve tried to do in software what heseems to do in hardware.P. G. WodehousePeople are finally starting to admit that Wodehouse was a greatwriter.  If you want to be thought a great novelist in your owntime, you have to sound intellectual.  If what you write is popular,or entertaining, or funny, you\\'re ipso facto suspect.  That makesWodehouse doubly impressive, because it meant that to write as hewanted to, he had to commit to being despised in his own lifetime.Evelyn Waugh called him a great writer, but to most people at thetime that would have read as a chivalrous or deliberately perversegesture. At the time any random autobiographical novel by a recentcollege grad could count on more respectful treatment from theliterary establishment.Wodehouse may have begun with simple atoms, but the way he composedthem into molecules was near faultless.  His rhythm in particular.It makes me self-conscious to write about it.  I can think of onlytwo other writers who came near him for style: Evelyn Waugh andNancy Mitford.  Those three used the English language like theyowned it.But Wodehouse has something neither of them did.  He\\'s at ease.Evelyn Waugh and Nancy Mitford cared what other people thought ofthem: he wanted to seem aristocratic; she was afraid she wasn\\'tsmart enough.  But Wodehouse didn\\'t give a damn what anyone thoughtof him.  He wrote exactly what he wanted.Alexander CalderCalder\\'s on this list because he makes me happy.  Can his work standup to Leonardo\\'s?  Probably not.  There might not be anything fromthe 20th Century that can.  But what was good about Modernism,Calder had, and had in a way that he made seem effortless.What was good about Modernism was its freshness.  Art became stuffyin the nineteenth century.  The paintings that were popular at thetime were mostly the art equivalent of McMansions—big,pretentious, and fake.  Modernism meant starting over, making thingswith the same earnest motives that children might.  The artists whobenefited most from this were the ones who had preserved a child\\'sconfidence, like Klee and Calder.Klee was impressive because he could work in so many differentstyles.  But between the two I like Calder better, because his workseemed happier.  Ultimately the point of art is to engage the viewer.It\\'s hard to predict what will; often something that seems interestingat first will bore you after a month.  Calder\\'ssculpturesneverget boring.  They just sit there quietly radiating optimism, likea battery that never runs out.  As far as I can tell from books andphotographs, the happiness of Calder\\'s work is his own happinessshowing through.Jane AustenEveryone admires Jane Austen.  Add my name to the list.  To me sheseems the best novelist of all time.I\\'m interested in how things work.  When I read most novels, I payas much attention to the author\\'s choices as to the story.  But inher novels I can\\'t see the gears at work.  Though I\\'d really liketo know how she does what she does, I can\\'t figure it out, becauseshe\\'s so good that her stories don\\'t seem made up.  I feel like I\\'mreading a description of something that actually happened.I used to read a lot of novels when I was younger.  I can\\'t readmost anymore, because they don\\'t have enough information in them.Novels seem so impoverished compared to history and biography.  But reading Austen is like readingnonfiction.  She writes so well you don\\'t even notice her.John McCarthyJohn McCarthy invented Lisp, the field of (or at least the term)artificial intelligence, and was an early member of both of the toptwo computer science departments, MIT and Stanford.  No one woulddispute that he\\'s one of the greats, but he\\'s an especial hero tome because ofLisp.It\\'s hard for us now to understand what a conceptual leap that wasat the time.  Paradoxically, one of the reasons his achievement ishard to appreciate is that it was so successful.  Practically everyprogramming language invented in the last 20 years includes ideasfrom Lisp, and each year the median language gets more Lisplike.In 1958 these ideas were anything but obvious.  In 1958 there seemto have been two ways of thinking about programming.  Some peoplethought of it as math, and proved things about Turing Machines.Others thought of it as a way to get things done, and designedlanguages all too influenced by the technology of the day.  McCarthyalone bridged the gap.  He designed a language that was math.  Butdesigned is not really the word; discovered is more like it.The SpitfireAs I was making this list I found myself thinking of people likeDouglas BaderandR.J. MitchellandJeffrey Quilland I realizedthat though all of them had done many things in their lives, therewas one factor above all that connected them: the Spitfire.This is supposed to be a list of heroes.  How can a machine be onit?  Because that machine was not just a machine.  It was a lensof heroes.  Extraordinary devotion went into it, and extraordinarycourage came out.It\\'s a cliche to call World War II a contest between good and evil,but between fighter designs, it really was.  The Spitfire\\'s originalnemesis, the ME 109, was a brutally practical plane.  It was akilling machine.  The Spitfire was optimism embodied.  And not justin its beautiful lines: it was at the edge of what could bemanufactured.  But taking the high road worked.  In the air, beautyhad the edge, just.Steve JobsPeople alive when Kennedy was killed  usually remember exactly wherethey were when they heard about it.  I remember exactly where I waswhen a friend asked if I\\'d heard Steve Jobs had cancer.  It waslike the floor dropped out.   A few seconds later she told me thatit was a rare operable type, and that he\\'d be ok.  But those secondsseemed long.I wasn\\'t sure whether to include Jobs on this list.  A lot of peopleat Apple seem to be afraid of him, which is a bad sign.  But hecompels admiration.There\\'s no name for what Steve Jobs is, because there hasn\\'t beenanyone quite like him before.  He doesn\\'t design Apple\\'s productshimself.  Historically the closest analogy to what he does are thegreat Renaissance patrons of the arts.  As the CEO of a company,that makes him unique.Most CEOs delegatetasteto a subordinate.Thedesign paradoxmeans they\\'re choosing more or less at random.  But SteveJobs actually has taste himself — such good taste that he\\'s shownthe world how much more important taste is than they realized.Isaac NewtonNewton has a strange role in my pantheon of heroes: he\\'s the one Ireproach myself with.  He worked on big things, at least for partof his life.  It\\'s so easy to get distracted working on small stuff.The questions you\\'re answering are pleasantly familiar.  You getimmediate rewards — in fact, you get bigger rewards in yourtime if you work on matters of passing importance.  But I\\'muncomfortably aware that this is the route to well-deserved obscurity.To do really great things, you have to seek out questions peopledidn\\'t even realize were questions.  There have probably been otherpeople who did this as well as Newton, for their time, but Newtonis my model of this kind of thought.  I can just begin to understandwhat it must have felt like for him.You only get one life.  Why not do something huge?  The phrase \"paradigmshift\" is overused now, but Kuhn was onto something.  And you knowmore are out there, separated from us by what will later seem asurprisingly thin wall of laziness and stupidity.  If we work likeNewton.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': '(This essay is derived from a talk at Defcon 2005.)Suppose you wanted to get rid of economic inequality.  There aretwo ways to do it: give money to the poor, or take it away from the rich.  But they amount to the same thing, because if you want togive money to the poor, you have to get it from somewhere.  Youcan\\'t get it from the poor, or they just end up where they started.You have to get it from the rich.There is of course a way to make the poor richer without simplyshifting money from the rich.  You could help the poor become moreproductive — for example, by improving access to education.  Insteadof taking money from engineers and giving it to checkout clerks,you could enable people who would have become checkout clerks tobecome engineers.This is an excellent strategy for making the poor richer.  But theevidence of the last 200 years shows that it doesn\\'t reduce economicinequality, because it makes the rich richer too.  If thereare more engineers, then there are more opportunities to hire themand to sell them things.  Henry Ford couldn\\'t have made a fortune  building cars in a society in which most people were still subsistencefarmers; he would have had neither workers nor customers.If you want to reduce economic inequality instead of just improvingthe overall standard of living, it\\'s not enough just to raise up  the poor.  What if one of your newly minted engineers gets ambitiousand goes on to become another Bill Gates?  Economic inequality willbe as bad as ever.  If you actually want to compress the gap betweenrich and poor, you have to push down on the top as well as pushingup on the bottom.How do you push down on the top?  You could try to decrease theproductivity of the people who make the most money: make the best   surgeons operate with their left hands, force popular actors toovereat, and so on.  But this approach is hard to implement.  Theonly practical solution is to let people do the best work they can,and then (either by taxation or by limiting what they can charge)to confiscate whatever you deem to be surplus.So let\\'s be clear what reducing economic inequality means.  It is   identical with taking money from the rich.When you transform a mathematical expression into another form, youoften notice new things.  So it is in this case.  Taking money fromthe rich turns out to have consequences one might not foresee whenone phrases the same idea in terms of \"reducing inequality.\"The problem is, risk and reward have to be proportionate.  A bet  with only a 10% chance of winning has to pay more than one with a50% chance of winning, or no one will take it.  So if you lop offthe top of the possible rewards, you thereby decrease people\\'swillingness to take risks.Transposing into our original expression, we get: decreasing economicinequality means decreasing the risk people are willing to take.There are whole classes of risks that are no longer worth taking    if the maximum return is decreased.  One reason high tax rates aredisastrous is that this class of risks includes starting newcompanies.InvestorsStartups are intrinsically risky.  A startupis like a small boatin the open sea.  One big wave and you\\'re sunk.  A competing product,a downturn in the economy, a delay in getting funding or regulatoryapproval, a patent suit, changing technical standards, the departureof a key employee, the loss of a big account — any one of these candestroy you overnight.  It seems only about 1 in 10 startups succeeds.Our startup paid its first round of outside investors 36x.  Which   meant, with current US tax rates, that it made sense to invest inus if we had better than a 1 in 24 chance of succeeding.  That  sounds about right.  That\\'s probably roughly how we looked when wewere a couple of nerds with no business experience operating outof an apartment.If that kind of risk doesn\\'t pay, venture investing, as we know it,doesn\\'t happen.That might be ok if there were other sources of capital for newcompanies.  Why not just have the government, or some largealmost-government organization like Fannie Mae, do the ventureinvesting instead of private funds?I\\'ll tell you why that wouldn\\'t work. Because then you\\'re askinggovernment or almost-government employees to do the one thing they are least able to do: take risks.As anyone who has worked for the government knows, the importantthing is not to make the right choices, but to make choices thatcan be justified later if they fail.  If there is a safe option,that\\'s the one a bureaucrat will choose.   But that is exactly the  wrong way to do venture investing.  The nature of the business meansthat you want to make terribly risky choices, if the upside looksgood enough.VCs are currentlypaidin a way that makes them focus on the upside:they get a percentage of the fund\\'s gains.  And that helps overcometheir understandable fear of investing in a company run by nerdswho look like (and perhaps are) college students.If VCs weren\\'t allowed to get rich, they\\'d behave like bureaucrats.Without hope of gain, they\\'d have only fear of loss.  And so they\\'dmake the wrong choices.  They\\'d turn down the nerds in favor of thesmooth-talking MBA in a suit, because that investment would beeasier to justify later if it failed.FoundersBut even if you could somehow redesign venture funding to workwithout allowing VCs to become rich, there\\'s another kind of investoryou simply cannot replace: the startups\\' founders and early employees.What they invest is their time and ideas.  But these are equivalentto money; the proof is that investors are willing (if forced) totreat them as interchangeable, granting the same status to \"sweat   equity\" and the equity they\\'ve purchased with cash.The fact that you\\'re investing time doesn\\'t change the relationshipbetween risk and reward.  If you\\'re going to invest your time insomething with a small chance of succeeding, you\\'ll only do it ifthere is a proportionately large payoff.If large payoffs aren\\'t allowed, you may as well play it safe.Like many startup founders, I did it to get rich.  But not because I wanted to buy expensive things.  What I wanted was security.  I   wanted to make enough money that I didn\\'t have to worry about money.If I\\'d been forbidden to make enough from a startup to do this, Iwould have sought security by some other means: for example, bygoing to work for a big, stable organization from which it wouldbe hard to get fired.  Instead of busting my ass in a startup, I    would have tried to get a nice, low-stress job at a big research lab, or tenure at a university.That\\'s what everyone does in societies where risk isn\\'t rewarded.If you can\\'t ensure your own security, the next best thing is tomake a nest for yourself in some large organization where yourstatus depends mostly onseniority.Even if we could somehow replace investors, I don\\'t see how we couldreplace founders.  Investors mainly contribute money, which inprinciple is the same no matter what the source.  But the founderscontribute ideas.  You can\\'t replace those.Let\\'s rehearse the chain of argument so far.  I\\'m heading for a conclusion to which many readers will have to be dragged kicking   and screaming, so I\\'ve tried to make each link unbreakable.  Decreasingeconomic inequality means taking money from the rich.  Since riskand reward are equivalent, decreasing potential rewards automaticallydecreases people\\'s appetite for risk.  Startups are intrinsicallyrisky.  Without the prospect of rewards proportionate to the risk,founders will not invest their time in a startup.  Founders areirreplaceable.  So eliminating economic inequality means eliminatingstartups.Economic inequality is not just a consequence of startups.It\\'s the engine that drives them, in the same way a fall of water   drives a water mill.  People start startups in the hope of becomingmuch richer than they were before.  And if your society tries toprevent anyone from being much richer than anyone else, it willalso prevent one person from being much richer at t2 than t1.GrowthThis argument applies proportionately.  It\\'s not just that if you  eliminate economic inequality, you get no startups.  To the extent you reduce economic inequality, you decrease the number of startups.Increase taxes, and willingness to take risks decreases inproportion.And that seems bad for everyone.  New technology and new jobs bothcome disproportionately from new companies.  Indeed, if you don\\'thave startups, pretty soon you won\\'t have established companieseither, just as, if you stop having kids, pretty soon you won\\'thave any adults.It sounds benevolent to say we ought to reduce economic inequality. When you phrase it that way, who can argue with you?Inequalityhas to be bad, right?  It sounds a good deal less benevolent to saywe ought to reduce the rate at which new companies are founded.And yet the one implies the other.Indeed, it may be that reducing investors\\' appetite for risk doesn\\'tmerely kill off larval startups, but kills off the most promisingones especially.  Startups yield faster growth at greater risk thanestablished companies.  Does this trend also hold among startups?That is, are the riskiest startups the ones that generate mostgrowth if they succeed?  I suspect the answer is yes.  And that\\'s   a chilling thought, because it means that if you cut investors\\'appetite for risk, the most beneficial startups are the first to go.Not all rich people got that way from startups, of course.  Whatif we let people get rich by starting startups, but taxed away allother surplus wealth?  Wouldn\\'t that at least decrease inequality?Less than you might think.  If you made it so that people couldonly get rich by starting startups, people who wanted to get richwould all start startups.  And that might be a great thing.  But Idon\\'t think it would have much effect on the distribution of wealth.People who want to get rich will do whatever they have to.  Ifstartups are the only way to do it, you\\'ll just get far more peoplestarting startups.  (If you write the laws very carefully, that is.More likely, you\\'ll just get a lot of people doing things that canbe made to look on paper like startups.)If we\\'re determined to eliminate economic inequality, there is stillone way out: we could say that we\\'re willing to go ahead and dowithout startups.  What would happen if we did?At a minimum, we\\'d have to accept lower rates of technological   growth.  If you believe that large, established companies could   somehow be made to develop new technology as fast as startups, theball is in your court to explain how.  (If you can come up with a   remotely plausible story, you can make a fortune writing businessbooks and consulting for large companies.)Ok, so we get slower growth.  Is that so bad?  Well, one reasonit\\'s bad in practice is that other countries might not agree toslow down with us.  If you\\'re content to develop new technologiesat a slower rate than the rest of the world, what happens is thatyou don\\'t invent anything at all.  Anything you might discover hasalready been invented elsewhere.  And the only thing you can offer in return is raw materials and cheap labor.  Once you sink thatlow, other countries can do whatever they like with you: installpuppet governments, siphon off your best workers, use your womenas prostitutes, dump their toxic waste on your territory — all thethings we do to poor countries now.  The only defense is to isolateyourself, as communist countries did in the twentieth century.  Butthe problem then is, you have to become a police state to enforce it.Wealth and PowerI realize startups are not the main target of those who want toeliminate economic inequality.   What they really dislike is thesort of wealth that becomes self-perpetuating through an alliancewith power. For example, construction firms that fund politicians\\'campaigns in return for government contracts, or rich parents who   get their children into good colleges by sending them to expensiveschools designed for that purpose.  But if you try to attack this type of wealththrougheconomicpolicy, it\\'s hard to hit without destroyingstartups as collateral damage.The problem here is not wealth, but corruption.  So why not go aftercorruption?We don\\'t need to prevent people from being rich if we can preventwealth from translating into power.  And there has been progresson that front.  Before he died of drink in 1925, Commodore Vanderbilt\\'swastrel grandson Reggie ran down pedestrians on five separate   occasions, killing two of them.  By 1969, when Ted Kennedy drove  off the bridge at Chappaquiddick, the limit seemed to be down to  one.  Today it may well be zero.  But what\\'s changed is not variationin wealth.  What\\'s changed is the ability to translate wealth intopower.How do you break the connection between wealth and power?  Demand   transparency.  Watch closely how power is exercised, and demand anaccount of how decisions are made.  Why aren\\'t all police interrogationsvideotaped?  Why did 36% of Princeton\\'s class of 2007 come fromprep schools, when only 1.7% of American kids attend them?  Why didthe US really invade Iraq?  Why don\\'t government officials disclosemore about their finances, and why only during their term of office?A friend of mine who knows a lot about computer security says thesingle most important step is to log everything.  Back when he wasa kid trying to break into computers, what worried him most was theidea of leaving a trail.  He was more inconvenienced by the need to avoid that than by any obstacle deliberately put in his path.Like all illicit connections, the connection between wealth and     power flourishes in secret.  Expose all transactions, and you willgreatly reduce it.  Log everything.  That\\'s a strategy that alreadyseems to be working, and it doesn\\'t have the side effect of makingyour whole country poor.I don\\'t think many people realize there is a connection betweeneconomic inequality and risk.  I didn\\'t fully grasp it till recently.I\\'d known for years of course that if one didn\\'t score in a startup,the other alternative was to get a cozy, tenured research job.  ButI didn\\'t understand the equation governing my behavior.  Likewise, it\\'s obvious empirically that a country that doesn\\'t let people getrich is headed for disaster, whether it\\'s Diocletian\\'s Rome or  Harold Wilson\\'s Britain.  But I did not till recently understandthe role risk played.If you try to attack wealth, you end up nailing risk as well, and  with it growth.  If we want a fairer world, I think we\\'re better  off attacking one step downstream, where wealth turns into power.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'To celebrate Airbnb\\'s IPO and to help future founders, I thoughtit might be useful to explain what was special about Airbnb.What was special about the Airbnbs was how earnest they were. Theydid nothing half-way, and we could sense this even in the interview.Sometimes after we interviewed a startup we\\'d be uncertain what todo, and have to talk it over. Other times we\\'d just look at oneanother and smile. The Airbnbs\\' interview was that kind. We didn\\'teven like the idea that much. Nor did users, at that stage; theyhad no growth. But the founders seemed so full of energy that itwas impossible not to like them.That first impression was not misleading. During the batch ournickname for Brian Chesky was The Tasmanian Devil, because like thecartooncharacterhe seemed a tornado of energy. All three of them werelike that. No one ever worked harder during YC than the Airbnbsdid. When you talked to the Airbnbs, they took notes. If you suggestedan idea to them in office hours, the next time you talked to themthey\\'d not only have implemented it, but also implemented two newideas they had in the process. \"They probably have the best attitudeof any startup we\\'ve funded\" I wrote to Mike Arrington during thebatch.They\\'re still like that. Jessica and I had dinner with Brian in thesummer of 2018, just the three of us. By this point the company isten years old. He took a page of notes about ideas for new thingsAirbnb could do.What we didn\\'t realize when we first met Brian and Joe and Nate wasthat Airbnb was on its last legs. After working on the company fora year and getting no growth, they\\'d agreed to give it one lastshot. They\\'d try this Y Combinator thing, and if the company stilldidn\\'t take off, they\\'d give up.Any normal person would have given up already. They\\'d been fundingthe company with credit cards. They had abinderfull ofcredit cards they\\'d maxed out. Investors didn\\'t think much of theidea. One investor they met in a cafe walked out in the middle ofmeeting with them. They thought he was going to the bathroom, buthe never came back. \"He didn\\'t even finish his smoothie,\" Briansaid. And now, in late 2008, it was the worst recession in decades.The stock market was in free fall and wouldn\\'t hit bottom for anotherfour months.Why hadn\\'t they given up? This is a useful question to ask. People,like matter, reveal their nature under extreme conditions. One thingthat\\'s clear is that they weren\\'t doing this just for the money.As a money-making scheme, this was pretty lousy: a year\\'s work andall they had to show for it was a binder full of maxed-out creditcards. So why were they still working on this startup? Because ofthe experience they\\'d had as the first hosts.When they first tried renting out airbeds on their floor during adesign convention, all they were hoping for was to make enough moneyto pay their rent that month. But something surprising happened:they enjoyed having those first three guests staying with them. Andthe guests enjoyed it too. Both they and the guests had done itbecause they were in a sense forced to, and yet they\\'d all had agreat experience. Clearly there was something new here: for hosts,a new way to make money that had literally been right under theirnoses, and for guests, a new way to travel that was in many waysbetter than hotels.That experience was why the Airbnbs didn\\'t give up. They knew they\\'ddiscovered something. They\\'d seen a glimpse of the future, and theycouldn\\'t let it go.They knew that once people tried staying in what is now called \"anairbnb,\" they would also realize that this was the future. But onlyif they tried it, and they weren\\'t. That was the problem during YCombinator: to get growth started.Airbnb\\'s goal during YC was to reach what we callramen profitability,which means making enough money that the company can pay the founders\\'living expenses, if they live on ramen noodles. Ramen profitabilityis not, obviously, the end goal of any startup, but it\\'s the mostimportant threshold on the way, because this is the point whereyou\\'re airborne. This is the point where you no longer need investors\\'permission to continue existing. For the Airbnbs, ramen profitabilitywas $4000 a month: $3500 for rent, and $500 for food. They tapedthis goal to the mirror in the bathroom of their apartment.The way to get growth started in something like Airbnb is to focuson the hottest subset of the market. If you can get growth startedthere, it will spread to the rest. When I asked the Airbnbs wherethere was most demand, they knew from searches: New York City. Sothey focused on New York. They went therein personto visit theirhosts and help them make their listings more attractive. A big partof that was better pictures. So Joe and Brian rented a professionalcamera and took pictures of the hosts\\' places themselves.This didn\\'t just make the listings better. It also taught them abouttheir hosts. When they came back from their first trip to New York,I asked what they\\'d noticed about hosts that surprised them, andthey said the biggest surprise was how many of the hosts were inthe same position they\\'d been in: they needed this money to paytheir rent. This was, remember, the worst recession in decades, andit had hit New York first. It definitely added to the Airbnbs\\' senseof mission to feel that people needed them.In late January 2009, about three weeks into Y Combinator, theirefforts started to show results, and their numbers crept upward.But it was hard to say for sure whether it was growth or just randomfluctuation. By February it was clear that it was real growth. Theymade $460 in fees in the first week of February, $897 in the second,and $1428 in the third. That was it: they were airborne. Brian sentme an email on February 22 announcing that they were ramen profitableand giving the last three weeks\\' numbers.\"I assume you know what you\\'ve now set yourself up for next week,\"I responded.Brian\\'s reply was seven words: \"We are not going to slow down.\"'},\n",

       " {'title': 'Two Kinds of Judgement',\n",
       "  'date': 'April 2007',\n",
       "  'essay_text': \"There are two different ways people judge you.  Sometimes judgingyou correctly is the end goal.  But there's a second much morecommon type of judgement where it isn't.  We tend to regard alljudgements of us as the first type.  We'd probably be happier ifwe realized which are and which aren't.The first type of judgement, the type where judging you is the endgoal, include court cases, grades in classes, and most competitions.Such judgements can of course be mistaken, but because the goal isto judge you correctly, there's usually some kind of appeals process.If you feel you've been misjudged, you can protest that you've beentreated unfairly.Nearly all the judgements made on children are of this type, so weget into the habit early in life of thinking that all judgementsare.But in fact there is a second much larger class of judgements wherejudging you is only a means to something else.  These include collegeadmissions, hiring and investment decisions, and of course thejudgements made in dating.  This kind of judgement is not reallyabout you.Put yourself in the position of someone selecting players for anational team.  Suppose for the sake of simplicity that this is agame with no positions, and that you have to select 20 players.There will be a few stars who clearly should make the team, andmany players who clearly shouldn't.  The only place your judgementmakes a difference is in the borderline cases.  Suppose you screwup and underestimate the 20th best player, causing him not to makethe team, and his place to be taken by the 21st best.  You've stillpicked a good team.  If the players have the usual distribution ofability, the 21st best player will be only slightly worse than the20th best.  Probably the difference between them will be less thanthe measurement error.The 20th best player may feel he has been misjudged.  But your goalhere wasn't to provide a service estimating people's ability.  Itwas to pick a team, and if the difference between the 20th and 21stbest players is less than the measurement error, you've still donethat optimally.It's a false analogy even to use the word unfair to describe thiskind of misjudgement.  It's not aimed at producing a correct estimateof any given individual, but at selecting a reasonably optimal set.One thing that leads us astray here is that the selector seems tobe in a position of power.  That makes him seem like a judge.  Ifyou regard someone judging you as a customer instead of a judge,the expectation of fairness goes away.  The author of a good novelwouldn't complain that readers wereunfairfor preferring apotboiler with a racy cover.  Stupid, perhaps, but not unfair.Our early training and our self-centeredness combine to make usbelieve that every judgement of us is about us.  In fact most aren't.This is a rare case where being less self-centered will make peoplemore confident.  Once you realize how little most people judgingyou care about judging you accurately—once you realize that becauseof the normal distribution of most applicant pools, it matters leastto judge accurately in precisely the cases where judgement has themost effect—you won't take rejection so personally.And curiously enough, taking rejection less personally may help youto get rejected less often.  If you think someone judging you willwork hard to judge you correctly, you can afford to be passive.But the more you realize that most judgements are greatly influencedby random, extraneous factors—that most people judging you aremore like a fickle novel buyer than a wise and perceptive magistrate—the more you realize you can do things to influence theoutcome.One good place to apply this principle is in college applications.Most high school students applying to college do it with the usualchild's mix of inferiority and self-centeredness: inferiority inthat they assume that admissions committees must be all-seeing;self-centeredness in that they assume admissions committees careenough about them to dig down into their application and figure outwhether they're good or not.  These combine to make applicantspassive in applying and hurt when they're rejected.  If collegeapplicants realized how quick and impersonal most selection processesare, they'd make more effort to sell themselves, and take the outcomeless personally.Spanish TranslationRussian TranslationArabic Translation\"},\n",

We managed to drag a lot of them about halfway to Lisp.\"- Guy Steele, co-author of the Java specIn the software business there is an ongoingstruggle between the pointy-headed academics, and anotherequally formidable force, the pointy-haired bosses.  Everyoneknows who the pointy-haired boss is, right?  I think mostpeople in the technology world not only recognize thiscartoon character, but know the actual person in their companythat he is modelled upon.The pointy-haired boss miraculously combines two qualitiesthat are common by themselves, but rarely seen together:(a) he knows nothing whatsoever about technology, and(b) he has very strong opinions about it.Suppose, for example, you need to write a piece of software.The pointy-haired boss has no idea how this softwarehas to work, and can\\'t tell one programming language fromanother, and yet he knows what language you should write it in.Exactly.  He thinks you should write it in Java.Why does he think this?  Let\\'stake a look inside the brain of the pointy-haired boss.  Whathe\\'s thinking is something like this.  Java is a standard.I know it must be, because I read about it in the press all the time.Since it is a standard, I won\\'t get in trouble for using it.And that also means there will always be lots of Java programmers,so if the programmers working for me now quit, as programmersworking for me mysteriously always do, I can easily replacethem.Well, this doesn\\'t sound that unreasonable.  But it\\'s allbased on one unspoken assumption, and that assumptionturns out to be false.  The pointy-haired boss believes that allprogramming languages are pretty much equivalent.If that were true, he would be right ontarget.  If languages are all equivalent, sure, use whatever language everyone else is using.But all languages are not equivalent, and I think I can provethis to you without even getting into the differences between them.If you asked the pointy-haired boss in 1992 what language     software should be written in, he would have answered with aslittle hesitation as he does today.  Software should be  written in C++.  But if languages are all equivalent, why should thepointy-haired boss\\'s opinion ever change?  In fact, why shouldthe developers of Java have even bothered to create a newlanguage?Presumably, if you create a new language, it\\'s because you thinkit\\'s better in some way than what people already had.  And in fact, Goslingmakes it clear in the first Java white paper that Javawas designed to fix some problems with C++.So there you have it: languages are not all equivalent.If you follow thetrail through the pointy-haired boss\\'s brain to Java and thenback through Java\\'s history to its origins, you end up holdingan idea that contradicts the assumption you started with.So, who\\'s right?  James Gosling, or the pointy-haired boss?Not surprisingly, Gosling is right.  Some languagesarebetter,for certain problems, than others.  And you know, that raises someinteresting questions.  Java was designed to be better, for certainproblems, than C++.  What problems?  When is Java better and when is C++?  Are there situations where other languages arebetter than either of them?Once you start considering this question, you have opened areal can of worms.  If the pointy-haired boss had to thinkabout the problem in its full complexity, it would make hisbrain explode.  As long as he considers all languages   equivalent, all he has to do is choose the onethat seems to have the most momentum, and since that is morea question of fashion than technology, even hecan probably get the right answer.But if languages vary, he suddenlyhas to solve two simultaneous equations, trying to findan optimal balance between two things he knows nothing   about: the relative suitability of the twenty or so leadinglanguages for the problem he needs to solve, and the odds offinding programmers, libraries, etc. for each.If that\\'s what\\'s on the other side of the door, itis no surprise that the pointy-haired boss doesn\\'t want to open it.The disadvantage of believing that all programming languagesare equivalent is that it\\'s not true.  But the advantage is that it makes your life a lot simpler.And I think that\\'s the main reason the idea is so widespread.It is acomfortableidea.We know that Java must be pretty good, because it is thecool, new programming language.  Or is it?  If you look at the world ofprogramming languages from a distance, it looks like Java isthe latest thing.  (From far enough away, all you can see isthe large, flashing billboard paid for by Sun.)But if you look at this worldup close, you find that there are degrees of coolness.  Withinthe hacker subculture, there is another language called Perlthat is considered a lot cooler than Java.  Slashdot, forexample, is generated by Perl.  I don\\'t think you would findthose guys using Java Server Pages.  But there is another,newer language, called Python, whose users tend to look down on Perl,andmorewaiting in the wings.If you look at these languages in order, Java, Perl, Python,you notice an interesting pattern.  At least, you notice thispattern if you are a Lisp hacker.  Each one is progressively more like Lisp.  Python copies even featuresthat many Lisp hackers consider to be mistakes.You could translate simple Lisp programs into Python line for line.It\\'s 2002, and programming languages have almost caught up with 1958.Catching Up with MathWhat I mean is thatLisp was first discovered by John McCarthy in 1958,and popular programming languages are only nowcatching up with the ideas he developed then.Now, how could that be true?  Isn\\'t computer technology somethingthat changes very rapidly?  I mean, in 1958, computers wererefrigerator-sized behemoths with the processing power of    a wristwatch.  How could any technology that old even berelevant, let alone superior to the latest developments?I\\'ll tell you how.  It\\'s because Lisp was not reallydesigned to be a programming language, at least not in the sensewe mean today.  What we mean by a programming language issomething we use to tell a computer what to do.   McCarthydid eventually intend to develop a programming language inthis sense, but the Lisp that we actually ended up with was basedon something separate that he did as atheoretical exercise-- an effortto define a more convenient alternative to the Turing Machine.As McCarthy said later,Another way to show that Lisp was neater than Turing machineswas to write a universal Lisp functionand show that it is briefer and more comprehensible than thedescription of a universal Turing machine.This was the Lisp functioneval..., which computes the value ofa Lisp expression....Writingevalrequired inventing a notation representing Lispfunctions as Lisp data, and such a notationwas devised for the purposes of the paper with no thought thatit would be used to express Lisp programs in practice.What happened next was that, some time in late 1958, Steve Russell,one of McCarthy\\'sgrad students, looked at this definition ofevaland realized  that if he translated it into machine language, the resultwould be a Lisp interpreter.This was a big surprise at the time.Here is what McCarthy said about it later in an interview:Steve Russell said, look, why don\\'t I program thiseval..., andI said to him, ho, ho, you\\'re confusing theory with practice,thisevalis intended for reading, not forcomputing. But he went ahead and did it. That is, he compiled theevalin my paper into [IBM] 704 machinecode, fixing bugs, and then advertised this as a Lisp interpreter,which it certainly was. So at that point Lisphad essentially the form that it has today....Suddenly, in a matter of weeks I think, McCarthy found his theoreticalexercise transformed into an actual programming language-- and amore powerful one than he had intended.So the short explanation of why this 1950s language is notobsolete is that it was not technology but math, andmath doesn\\'t get stale.   The right thing to compare Lispto is not 1950s hardware, but, say, the Quicksortalgorithm, which was discovered in 1960 and is stillthe fastest general-purpose sort.There is one other language stillsurviving from the 1950s, Fortran, and it represents theopposite approach to language design.  Lisp was apiece of theory that unexpectedly got turned into aprogramming language.  Fortran was developed intentionally asa programming language, but what we would now consider avery low-level one.Fortran I, the language that wasdeveloped in 1956, was a very different animal from present-dayFortran.   Fortran I was pretty much assemblylanguage with math.  In some ways it was lesspowerful than more recent assembly languages; there were no   subroutines, for example, only branches.Present-day Fortran is now arguably closer to Lisp than toFortran I.Lisp and Fortran were the trunks of two separate evolutionary trees, one rooted in math and one rooted in machine architecture.These two trees have been converging ever since.Lisp started out powerful, and over the next twenty yearsgot fast.  So-called mainstream languages started outfast, and over the next forty years gradually got more powerful,until now the most advancedof them are fairly close to Lisp.Close, but they are still missing a few things....What Made Lisp DifferentWhen it was first developed, Lisp embodied nine newideas.  Some of these we now take for granted, others areonly seen in more advanced languages, and two are stillunique to Lisp.  The nine ideas are, in order of theiradoption by the mainstream,Conditionals.  A conditional is an if-then-elseconstruct.  We take these for granted now, but Fortran Ididn\\'t have them. It had only a conditional gotoclosely based on the underlying machine instruction.A function type. In Lisp, functions area data type just like integers or strings.They have a literal representation, can be stored in variables,can be passed as arguments, and so on.Recursion.  Lisp was the first programming language tosupport it.Dynamic typing.  In Lisp, all variablesare effectively pointers. Values are whathave types, not variables, and assigning or bindingvariables means copying pointers, not what they point to.Garbage-collection.Programs composed of expressions.  Lisp programs aretrees of expressions, each of which returns a value.This is in contrast to Fortranand most succeeding languages, which distinguish betweenexpressions and statements.It was natural to have thisdistinction in Fortran I becauseyou could not nest statements.  Andso while you needed expressions for math to work, there wasno point in making anything else return a value, becausethere could not be anything waiting for it.This limitationwent away with the arrival of block-structured languages,but by then it was too late. The distinction betweenexpressions and statements was entrenched.  It spread fromFortran into Algol and then to both their descendants.A symbol type.  Symbols are effectively pointers to stringsstored in a hash table.  Soyou can test equality by comparing a pointer,instead of comparing each character.A notation for code using trees of symbols and constants.The whole language there all the time.  There isno real distinction between read-time, compile-time, and runtime.You can compile or run code while reading, read or run codewhile compiling, and read or compile code at runtime.Running code at read-time lets users reprogram Lisp\\'s syntax;running code at compile-time is the basis of macros; compilingat runtime is the basis of Lisp\\'s use as an extensionlanguage in programs like Emacs; and reading at runtimeenables programs to communicate using s-expressions, anidea recently reinvented as XML.When Lisp first appeared, these ideas were farremoved from ordinary programming practice, which wasdictated largely by the hardware available in the late 1950s.Over time, the default language, embodiedin a succession of popular languages, hasgradually evolved toward Lisp.  Ideas 1-5 are now widespread.Number 6 is starting to appear in the mainstream.  Python has a form of 7, though there doesn\\'t seem to be    any syntax for it.As for number 8, this may be the most interesting of thelot.  Ideas 8 and 9 only became part of Lispby accident, because Steve Russell implementedsomething McCarthy had never intended to be implemented.And yet these ideas turn out to be responsible forboth Lisp\\'s strange appearance and its most distinctivefeatures.  Lisp looks strange not so much becauseit has a strange syntax as because it has no syntax;you express programs directly in the parse trees thatget built behind the scenes when other languages areparsed, and these trees are madeof lists, which are Lisp data structures.Expressing the language in its own data structures turnsout to be a very powerful feature. Ideas 8 and 9together mean that youcan write programs that write programs.  That may soundlike a bizarre idea, but it\\'s an everyday thing in Lisp. The most common way to do it is with something called amacro.The term \"macro\" does not mean in Lisp what it means in otherlanguages.A Lisp macro can be anything from an abbreviationto a compiler for a new language.If you want to really understand Lisp,or just expand your programming horizons, I wouldlearn moreabout macros.Macros (in the Lisp sense) are still, as far asI know, unique to Lisp.This is partly because in order to have macros youprobably have to make your language look as strange asLisp.  It may also be because if you do add that finalincrement of power, you can nolonger claim to have invented a new language, but onlya new dialect of Lisp.I mention this mostlyas a joke, but it is quite true. If you definea language that has car, cdr, cons, quote, cond, atom,eq, anda notation for functions expressed as lists, then youcan build all the rest of Lisp out of it.  That is infact the defining quality of Lisp: it was in order tomake this so that McCarthy gave Lisp the shape it has.Where Languages MatterSo suppose Lisp does represent a kind of limit     that mainstream languages are approaching asymptotically-- doesthat mean you should actually use it to write software?How much do you lose by using a less powerful language?Isn\\'t it wiser, sometimes, not to beat the very edge of innovation?And isn\\'t popularity to some extentits own justification?  Isn\\'t the pointy-haired boss right,for example, to want to use a language for which he can easilyhire programmers?There are, of course, projects where the choice of programminglanguage doesn\\'t matter much.  As arule, the more demanding the application, the moreleverage you get from using a powerful language.  Butplenty of projects are not demanding at all.Most programming probably consists of writing little glue programs, and for little glue programs youcan use any language that you\\'re alreadyfamiliar with and that has good libraries for whatever youneed to do.  If you just need to feed data from one   Windows app to another, sure, use Visual Basic.You can write little glue programs in Lisp too(I use it as a desktop calculator), but the biggest winfor languages like Lisp is at the other end ofthe spectrum, where you need to write sophisticatedprograms to solve hard problems in the face of fierce competition.A good example is theairline fare search programthat ITA Software licenses toOrbitz.  Theseguys entered a market already dominated by two big,entrenched competitors, Travelocity and Expedia, and  seem to have just humiliated them technologically.The core of ITA\\'s application is a 200,000 line Common Lisp programthat searches many orders of magnitude more possibilitiesthan their competitors, who apparentlyare still using mainframe-era programming techniques.(Though ITA is also in a senseusing a mainframe-era programming language.)I have never seen any of ITA\\'s code, but according toone of their top hackers they use a lot of macros,and I am not surprised to hear it.Centripetal ForcesI\\'m not saying there is no cost to using uncommon  technologies.  The pointy-haired boss is not completelymistaken to worry about this.  But because he doesn\\'t understandthe risks, he tends to magnify them.I can think of three problems that could arise from usingless common languages.  Your programs might not work well withprograms written in other languages.  You might have fewerlibraries at your disposal.  And you might have troublehiring programmers.How much of a problem is each of these?  The importance ofthe first varies depending on whether you have controlover the whole system.  If you\\'re writing software that hasto run on a remote user\\'s machine on top of a buggy,closed operating system (I mention no names), there may beadvantages to writing your application in thesame language as the OS.But if you control the whole system andhave the source code of all the parts, as ITA presumably does, youcan use whatever languages you want.  Ifany incompatibility arises, you can fix it yourself.In server-based applications you canget away with using the most advanced technologies,and I think this is the maincause of what Jonathan Erickson calls the \"programming languagerenaissance.\"  This is why we even hear about newlanguages like Perl and Python.  We\\'re not hearing about theselanguages because people are using them to write Windowsapps, but because people are using them on servers.  And assoftware shiftsoff the desktopand onto servers (a future evenMicrosoft seems resigned to), there will be lessand less pressure to use middle-of-the-road technologies.As for libraries, their importance alsodepends on the application.  For less demanding problems,the availability of libraries can outweigh the intrinsic powerof the language.  Where is the breakeven point?  Hard to sayexactly, but wherever it is, it is short of anything you\\'dbe likely to call an application.  If a company considersitself to be in the software business, and they\\'re writingan application that will be one of their products,then it will probably involve several hackers and take atleast six months to write.  In a project of thatsize, powerful languages probably start to outweighthe convenience of pre-existing libraries.The third worry of the pointy-haired boss, the difficultyof hiring programmers, I think is a red herring.   How manyhackers do you need to hire, after all?  Surely by now weall know that software is best developed by teams of lessthan ten people.   And you shouldn\\'t have trouble hiringhackers on that scale for any language anyone has ever heardof.  If you can\\'t find ten Lisp hackers, then your company isprobably based in the wrong city for developing software.In fact, choosing a more powerful language probably decreases thesize of the team you need, because (a) if you use a more powerfullanguage you probably won\\'t need as many hackers,and (b) hackers who work in more advanced languages are likelyto be smarter.I\\'m not saying that you won\\'t get a lot of pressure to usewhat are perceived as \"standard\" technologies.  At Viaweb(now Yahoo Store),we raised some eyebrows among VCs and potential acquirers byusing Lisp.  But we also raised eyebrows by usinggeneric Intel boxes as servers instead of\"industrial strength\" servers like Suns, for using athen-obscure open-source Unix variant called FreeBSD insteadof a real commercial OS like Windows NT, for ignoringa supposed e-commerce standard calledSETthat no one noweven remembers, and so on.You can\\'t let the suits make technical decisions for you.Did italarm some potential acquirers that we used Lisp?  Some, slightly,but if we hadn\\'t used Lisp, we wouldn\\'t have beenable to write the software that made them want to buy us.What seemed like an anomaly to them was in factcause and effect.If you start a startup, don\\'t design your product to pleaseVCs or potential acquirers.Design your product to pleasethe users.If you win the users, everything else willfollow.  And if you don\\'t, no one will carehow comfortingly orthodox your technology choices were.The Cost of Being AverageHow much do you lose by using a less powerful language?  There is actually some data out there about that.The most convenient measure of power is probablycode size.The point of high-levellanguages is to give you bigger abstractions-- bigger bricks,as it were, so you don\\'t need as many to builda wall of a given size.So the more powerfulthe language, the shorter the program (not simply incharacters, of course, but in distinct elements).How does a more powerful language enable you to writeshorter programs?  One technique you can use, if the language willlet you, is something calledbottom-up programming.  Instead ofsimply writing your application in the base language, youbuild on top of the base language a language for writingprograms like yours, then write your programin it. The combined code can be much shorter than if youhad written your whole program in the base language-- indeed,this is how most compression algorithms work.A bottom-up program should be easier to modify as well,  because in many cases the language layer won\\'t have to changeat all.Code size is important, because the time it takesto write a program depends mostly on its length.If your program would be three times as long in anotherlanguage, it will take three times as long to write-- andyou can\\'t get around this by hiring more people, becausebeyond a certain size new hires are actually a net lose.Fred Brooks described this phenomenon in his famousbookThe Mythical Man-Month,and everything I\\'ve seenhas tended to confirm what he said.So how much shorter are your programs if you write them inLisp?  Most of the numbers I\\'ve heard for Lispversus C, for example, have been around 7-10x.But a recent article about ITA inNewArchitectmagazine said that\"one line of Lisp can replace 20 lines of C,\" and sincethis article was full of quotes from ITA\\'s president, Iassume they got this number from ITA.  If so thenwe can put some faith in it; ITA\\'s software includes a lotof C and  C++ as well as Lisp, so they are speaking fromexperience.My guess is that these multiples aren\\'t even constant.I think they increase whenyou face harder problems and also when you have smarterprogrammers.  A really good hacker can squeeze moreout of better tools.As one data point on the curve, at any rate,if you were to compete with ITA andchose to write your software in C, they would be able to developsoftware twenty times faster than you.If you spent a year on a new feature, they\\'d be able toduplicate it in less than three weeks.  Whereas if they spentjust three months developing something new, it would befive yearsbefore you had it too.And you know what?  That\\'s the best-case scenario.When you talk about code-size ratios, you\\'re implicitly assumingthat you can actually write the program in the weaker language.But in fact there are limits on what programmers can do.If you\\'re trying to solve a hard problem with a language that\\'stoo low-level, you reach a point where there is just too much to keep in your head at once.So when I say it would take ITA\\'s imaginarycompetitor five years to duplicate something ITA couldwrite in Lisp in three months, I mean five yearsif nothing goes wrong.  In fact, the way things work in most companies, anydevelopment project that would take five years islikely never to get finished at all.I admit this is an extreme case.  ITA\\'s hackers seem tobe unusually smart, and C is a pretty low-level language.But in a competitive market, even a differential of two orthree to one wouldbe enough to guarantee that you\\'d always be behind.A RecipeThis is the kind of possibility that the pointy-haired bossdoesn\\'t even want to think about.  And so most of them don\\'t.Because, you know, when it comes down to it, the pointy-hairedboss doesn\\'t mind if his company gets their ass kicked, solong as no one can prove it\\'s his fault.The safest plan for him personallyis to stick close to the center of the herd.Within large organizations, the phrase used todescribe this approach is \"industry best practice.\"Its purpose is to shield the pointy-hairedboss from responsibility: if he choosessomething that is \"industry best practice,\" and the companyloses, he can\\'t be blamed.  He didn\\'t choose, the industry did.I believe this term was originally used to describeaccounting methods and so on.  What it means, roughly,isdon\\'t do anything weird.And in accounting that\\'sprobably a good idea.  The terms \"cutting-edge\" and  \"accounting\" do not sound good together.  But when you importthis criterion into decisions about technology, you startto get the wrong answers.Technology oftenshouldbecutting-edge.  In programming languages, as Erann Gathas pointed out, what \"industry best practice\"  actuallygets you is not the best, but merely theaverage.  When a decision causes you to develop software ata fraction of the rate of more aggressive competitors,  \"best practice\" is a misnomer.So here we have two pieces of information that I think arevery valuable.  In fact, I know it from my own experience.Number 1, languages vary in power.  Number 2, most managersdeliberately ignore this.  Between them, these two factsare literally a recipe for making money.  ITA is an exampleof this recipe in action.If you want to win in a softwarebusiness, just take on the hardest problem you can find,use the most powerful language you can get, and wait foryour competitors\\' pointy-haired bosses to revert to the mean.Appendix: PowerAs an illustration of what I mean about the relative powerof programming languages, consider the following problem.We want to write a function that generates accumulators-- afunction that takes a number n, andreturns a function that takes another number i andreturns n incremented by i.(That\\'sincremented by, not plus.  An accumulatorhas to accumulate.)In Common Lisp this would be(defun foo (n)  (lambda (i) (incf n i)))and in Perl 5,sub foo {    my ($n) = @_;  sub {$n += shift}}which has more elements than the Lisp version becauseyou have to extract parameters manually in Perl.In Smalltalk the code is slightly longer than in Lispfoo: n                                |s|                        s := n.                            ^[:i| s := s+i. ]because although in general lexical variables work, you can\\'tdo an assignment to a parameter, so you have to create anew variable s.In Javascript the example is, again, slightly longer, because Javascript retainsthe distinction between statements andexpressions, so you need explicitreturnstatementsto return values:function foo(n) {   return function (i) {            return n += i } }(To be fair, Perl also retainsthis distinction, but deals with it in typical Perl fashionby letting you omitreturns.)If you try to translate the Lisp/Perl/Smalltalk/Javascript code into Python you run into some limitations.  Because Pythondoesn\\'t fully support lexical variables,you have to create a data structure to hold the value of n.And althoughPython does have a function data type, there is noliteral representation for one (unless the body isonly a single expression) so you need to create a namedfunction to return.  This is what you end up with:def foo(n):  s = [n]  def bar(i):    s[0] += i    return s[0]   return barPython users might legitimately ask why they can\\'tjust writedef foo(n):  return lambda i: return n += ior evendef foo(n):  lambda i: n += iand my guess is that they probably will, one day.(But if they don\\'t want to wait for Python to evolve the restof the way into Lisp, they could always just...)In OO languages, you can, to a limited extent, simulatea closure (a function that refers to variables defined inenclosing scopes) by defining a class with one methodand a field to replace each variable from an enclosingscope.  This makes the programmer do the kind of codeanalysis that would be done by the compiler in a languagewith full support for lexical scope, and it won\\'t workif more than one function refers to the same variable,but it is enough in simple cases like this.Python experts seem to agree that this is thepreferred way to solve the problem in Python, writingeitherdef foo(n):  class acc:    def __init__(self, s):        self.s = s    def inc(self, i):        self.s += i        return self.s  return acc(n).incorclass foo:  def __init__(self, n):      self.n = n  def __call__(self, i):      self.n += i      return self.nI include these because I wouldn\\'t want Pythonadvocates to say I was misrepresenting the language,   but both seem to me more complex than the first   version.  You\\'re doing the same thing, setting upa separate place to hold the accumulator; it\\'s justa field in an object instead of the head of a list.And the use of these special,reserved field names, especially__call__, seemsa bit of a hack.In the rivalry between Perl and Python, the claim of thePython hackers seems to be thatthat Python is a more elegant alternative to Perl, but whatthis case shows is that power is the ultimate elegance:the Perl program is simpler (has fewer elements), even if thesyntax is a bit uglier.How about other languages? In the other languagesmentioned in this talk-- Fortran, C, C++, Java, andVisual Basic-- it is not clear whether you can actuallysolve this problem.Ken Anderson says that the following code is about as closeas you can get in Java:public interface Inttoint {  public int call(int i);}public static Inttoint foo(final int n) {  return new Inttoint() {    int s = n;    public int call(int i) {    s = s + i;    return s;    }};}This falls short of the spec because it only works forintegers.  After many email exchanges with Java hackers,I would say that writing a properly polymorphic versionthat behaves like the preceding examples is somewherebetween damned awkward and impossible.  If anyone wants towrite one I\\'d be very curious to see it, but I personallyhave timed out.It\\'s not literally true that you can\\'t solve thisproblem in other languages, of course.  The factthat all these languages are Turing-equivalent meansthat, strictly speaking, you can write any program inany of them.  So how would you do it?  In the limit case,by writing a Lispinterpreter in the less powerful language.That sounds like a joke, but it happens so often tovarying degrees in large programming projects thatthere is a name for the phenomenon, Greenspun\\'s TenthRule:Any sufficiently     complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc     informally-specified bug-ridden slow implementation of half of     Common Lisp.If you try to solve ahard problem, the question is not whether you will usea powerful enough language, but whether you will (a)use a powerful language, (b) write a de facto interpreterfor one, or (c) yourself become a human compiler for one.We see this alreadybegining to happen in the Python example, where we arein effect simulating the code that a compilerwould generate to implement a lexical variable.This practice is not only common, but institutionalized.  For example,in the OO world you hear a good deal about \"patterns\".I wonder if these patterns are not sometimes evidence of case (c),the human compiler, at work.  When I see patterns in my programs,I consider it a sign of trouble.  The shape of a programshould reflect only the problem it needs to solve.Any other regularity in the code is a sign, to me atleast, that I\\'m using abstractions that aren\\'t powerfulenough-- often that I\\'m generating by hand theexpansions of some macro that I need to write.'},\n",

There\\'s nothing dishonest about this.Everyone knows that these little social lies aren\\'t meantto be taken literally, just as everyone knows that \"Can you pass the salt?\" is only grammatically a question.I\\'m perfectly willing to smile and say \"pleased to meet you\"when meeting new people.  But there is another set of customs for being ingratiating in print that are not soharmless.The reason there\\'s a convention of being ingratiating in printis that most essays are written to persuade.And as any politician could tellyou, the way to persuade people is not just to baldly state thefacts.  You have to add a spoonful of sugar to make the medicinego down.For example, a politician announcing the cancellation of a government program will not merely say \"Theprogram is canceled.\" That would seem offensivelycurt.  Instead he\\'ll spend most of his time talking about thenoble effort made by the people who worked on it.The reason these conventions are more dangerous is that theyinteract with the ideas.  Saying \"pleased to meet you\" is justsomething you prepend to a conversation, but the sort of spin added by politicians is woven through it.  We\\'re starting tomove from social lies to real lies.Here\\'s an example of a paragraph from an essay I wrote aboutlabor unions.  As written,it tends to offend people who like unions.People who think the labor movement was the creation of heroic  union organizers have a problem to explain: why are unions shrinking  now?  The best they can do is fall back on the default explanation  of people living in fallen civilizations. Our ancestors were  giants.  The workers of the early twentieth century must have had  a moral courage that\\'s lacking today.Now here\\'s the same paragraph rewritten to please instead ofoffending them:Early union organizers made heroic sacrifices to improve conditions  for workers.  But though  labor unions are shrinking now, it\\'s not because present union  leaders are any less courageous.  An employer couldn\\'t get away  with hiring thugs to beat up union leaders today, but if they  did, I see no reason to believe today\\'s union leaders would shrink  from the challenge.  So I think it would be a mistake to attribute  the decline of unions to some kind of decline in the people who  run them.  Early union leaders were heroic, certainly, but we  should not suppose that if unions have declined, it\\'s because  present union leaders are somehow inferior.  The cause must be  external.It makes the same point: that it can\\'t have been the personalqualities of early union organizers that made unions successful,but must have been some external factor, or otherwise present-dayunion leaders would have to be inferior people.  But written thisway it seems like a defense of present-day union organizers ratherthan an attack on early ones.  That makes it more persuasive topeople who like unions, because it seems sympathetic to their cause.I believe everything I wrote in the second version.  Early unionleaders did make heroic sacrifices.   Andpresent union leaders probably would rise to the occasion ifnecessary.  People tend to; I\\'m skeptical about the idea of \"thegreatest generation.\"If I believe everything I said in the second version, why didn\\'t Iwrite it that way?  Why offend people needlessly?Because I\\'d rather offend people than pander to them, and if you write about controversial topics you have to choose one or the other.  The degree ofcourage of past or present union leaders is beside the point; allthat matters for the argument is that they\\'re the same.But if you want to pleasepeople who are mistaken, you can\\'t simply tell the truth.  You\\'realways going to have to add some sort of padding to protect theirmisconceptions from bumping against reality.Most writers do.  Most writers write to persuade, if only out ofhabit or politeness.  But I don\\'t write to persuade; I write tofigure out.  I write to persuade a hypothetical perfectly unbiasedreader.Since the custom is to write to persuade the actual reader, someonewho doesn\\'t will seem arrogant.  In fact, worse than arrogant: sincereaders are used to essays that try to please someone, an essaythat displeases one side in a dispute reads as an attempt to panderto the other.  To a lot of pro-union readers, the first paragraphsounds like the sort of thing a right-wing radio talk show hostwould say to stir up his followers.  But it\\'s not.  Something thatcurtly contradicts one\\'s beliefs can be hard to distinguish from apartisan attack on them, but though they can end up in the sameplace they come from different sources.Would it be so bad to add a few extra words, to make people feelbetter?  Maybe not.  Maybe I\\'m excessively attached to conciseness.I writecodethe same way I write essays, making pass after passlooking for anything I can cut.  But I have a legitimate reason fordoing this.  You don\\'t know what the ideas are until you get themdown to the fewest words.The danger of the second paragraphis not merely that it\\'s longer.  It\\'s that you start to lie toyourself.  The ideas start to get mixed together with the spinyou\\'ve added to get them past the readers\\' misconceptions.I think the goal of an essay should be to discoversurprisingthings.  That\\'s my goal, at least.And most surprising means most different from what people currentlybelieve.  So writing to persuade and writing to discover arediametrically opposed.  The more your conclusions disagree withreaders\\' present beliefs, the more effort you\\'ll have to expend onselling your ideas rather than having them.  As you accelerate,this drag increases, till eventually you reach a point where 100%of your energy is devoted to overcoming it and you can\\'t go anyfaster.It\\'s hard enough to overcome one\\'s own misconceptions without havingto think about how to get the resulting ideas past other people\\'s.I worry that if I wrote to persuade, I\\'d start to shy away unconsciouslyfrom ideas I knew would be hard to sell.  When I notice somethingsurprising, it\\'s usually very faint at first.  There\\'s nothing morethan a slight stirring of discomfort.  I don\\'t want anything to getin the way of noticing it consciously.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.March 2012One of the more surprising things I\\'ve noticed while workingon Y Combinator is how frightening the most ambitious startupideas are.  In this essay I\\'m going to demonstratethis phenomenon by describing some.  Any one of themcould make you a billionaire.  That might sound like an attractiveprospect, and yet when I describe these ideas you maynotice you find yourself shrinking away from them.Don\\'t worry, it\\'s not a sign of weakness.  Arguably it\\'s a sign ofsanity.  The biggest startup ideas are terrifying.  And not justbecause they\\'d be a lot of work.  The biggest ideas seem to threatenyour identity: you wonder if you\\'d have enough ambition to carrythem through.There\\'s a scene inBeing John Malkovichwhere the nerdy heroencounters a very attractive, sophisticated woman.  She says tohim:Here\\'s the thing: If you ever got me, you wouldn\\'t have a clue  what to do with me.That\\'s what these ideas say to us.This phenomenon is one of the most important things you can understandabout startups.You\\'d expect big startup ideas to beattractive, but actually they tend to repel you.  And that has abunch of consequences.  It means these ideas are invisible to mostpeople who try to think of startup ideas, because their subconsciousfilters them out.  Even the most ambitious people are probably bestoff approaching them obliquely.1. A New Search EngineThe best ideas are just on the right side of impossible.  I don\\'tknow if this one is possible, but there are signs it might be.Making a new search engine means competing with Google, and recentlyI\\'ve noticed some cracks in their fortress.The point when it became clear to me that Microsoft had lost theirway was when they decided to get into the search business.  Thatwas not a natural move for Microsoft.  They did it because theywere afraid of Google, and Google was in the search business.  Butthis meant (a) Google was now setting Microsoft\\'s agenda, and (b)Microsoft\\'s agenda consisted of stuff they weren\\'t good at.Microsoft : Google :: Google : Facebook.That does not by itself meanthere\\'s room for a new search engine, but lately when using Googlesearch I\\'ve found myself nostalgic for the old days, whenGoogle was true to its own slightly aspy self.  Google used to giveme a page of the right answers, fast, with no clutter.  Now theresults seem inspired by the Scientologist principle that what\\'strue is what\\'s true for you.  And the pages don\\'t have theclean, sparse feel they used to.  Google search results used tolook like the output of a Unix utility.  Now if I accidentally putthe cursor in the wrong place, anything might happen.The way to win here is to build the search engine all the hackersuse.  A search engine whose users consisted of the top 10,000 hackersand no one else would be in a very powerful position despite itssmall size, just as Google was when it was that search engine.  Andfor the first time in over a decade the idea of switching seemsthinkable to me.Since anyone capable of starting this company is one of those 10,000hackers, the route is at least straightforward: make the searchengine you yourself want.  Feel free to make it excessively hackerish.Make it really good for code search, for example.  Would you likesearch queries to be Turing complete?  Anything that gets you those10,000 users is ipso facto good.Don\\'t worry if something you want to do will constrain you in thelong term, because if you don\\'t get that initial core of users,there won\\'t be a long term.  If you can just build something thatyou and your friends genuinely prefer to Google, you\\'re alreadyabout 10% of the way to an IPO, just as Facebook was (though theyprobably didn\\'t realize it) when they got all the Harvard undergrads.2. Replace EmailEmail was not designed to be used the way we use it now.  Email isnot a messaging protocol.  It\\'s a todo list.  Or rather, my inboxis a todo list, and email is the way things get onto it.  But itis a disastrously bad todo list.I\\'m open to different types of solutions to this problem, but Isuspect that tweaking the inbox is not enough, and that email hasto be replaced with a new protocol. This new protocol should be a todo list protocol, nota messaging protocol, although there is a degenerate case wherewhat someone wants you to do is: read the following text.As a todo list protocol, the new protocol should give more powerto the recipient than email does.  I want there to be more restrictionson what someone can put on my todo list.  And when someone can putsomething on my todo list, I want them to tell me more about whatthey want from me.  Do they want me to do something beyond justreading some text?  How important is it?  (There obviously has tobe some mechanism to prevent people from saying everything isimportant.)  When does it have to be done?This is one of those ideas that\\'s like an irresistible force meetingan immovable object.  On one hand, entrenched protocols are impossibleto replace.  On the other, it seems unlikely that people in100 years will still be living in the same email hell we do now.And if email is going to get replaced eventually, why not now?If you do it right, you may be able to avoid the usual chicken and egg problem new protocols face, because some of the most powerfulpeople in the world will be among the first to switch to it.  They\\'re all at the mercy of email too.Whatever you build, make it fast.  GMail has become painfully slow.If you made something no better than GMail, but fast, thatalone would let you start to pull users away from GMail.GMail is slow because Google can\\'t afford to spend a lot on it.But people will pay for this.  I\\'d have no problem paying $50 a month.Considering how much time I spend in email, it\\'s kind of scary tothink how much I\\'d be justified in paying.  At least $1000 a month.If I spend several hours a day reading and writing email, that wouldbe a cheap way to make my life better.3. Replace UniversitiesPeople are all over this idea lately, and I think they\\'re ontosomething.  I\\'m reluctant to suggest that an institution that\\'sbeen around for a millennium is finished just because of some mistakesthey made in the last few decades, but certainly in the last fewdecades US universities seem to have been headed down the wrongpath.  One could do a lot better for a lot less money.I don\\'t think universities will disappear.  They won\\'t be replacedwholesale.  They\\'ll just lose the de facto monopoly on certain typesof learning that they once had.  There will be many different waysto learn different things, and some may look quite different fromuniversities.   Y Combinator itself is arguably one of them.Learning is such a big problem that changing the way people do itwill have a wave of secondary effects.  For example, the name ofthe university one went to is treated by a lot of people (correctlyor not) as a credential in its own right.  If learning breaks upinto many little pieces, credentialling may separate from it.  Theremay even need to be replacements for campus social life (and oddlyenough, YC even has aspects of that).You could replace high schools too, but there you face bureaucraticobstacles that would slow down a startup.  Universities seem theplace to start.4. Internet DramaHollywood has been slow to embrace the Internet.  That was a mistake, because I think we can now call a winner in the race betweendelivery mechanisms, and it is the Internet, not cable.A lot of the reason is the horribleness of cable clients, also knownas TVs.  Our family didn\\'t wait for Apple TV.  We hated our lastTV so much that a few months ago we replaced it with an iMac boltedto the wall.  It\\'s a little inconvenient to control it with awireless mouse, but the overall experience is much better than thenightmare UI we had to deal with before.Some of the attention people currently devote to watchingmovies and TV can be stolen by things that seem completely unrelated,like social networking apps.  More can be stolen by things that area little more closely related, like games.  But there will probablyalways remain some residual demand for conventional drama, whereyou sit passively and watch as a plot happens.  So how do you deliverdrama via the Internet?  Whatever you make will have to be on alarger scale than Youtube clips.  When people sit down to watch ashow, they want to know what they\\'re going to get: either partof a series with familiar characters, or a single longer \"movie\"whose basic premise they know in advance.There are two ways delivery and payment could play out.  Eithersome company like Netflix or Apple will be the app store forentertainment, and you\\'ll reach audiences through them.  Or thewould-be app stores will be too overreaching, or too technicallyinflexible, and companies will arise to supply payment and streaminga la carte to the producers of drama.  If that\\'s the way thingsplay out, there will also be a need for such infrastructure companies.5. The Next Steve JobsI was talking recently to someone who knew Apple well, and I askedhim if the people now running the company would be able to keepcreating new things the way Apple had under Steve Jobs.  His answerwas simply \"no.\"  I already feared that would be the answer.  Iasked more to see how he\\'d qualify it.  But he didn\\'t qualify itat all.  No, there will be no more great new stuff beyond whatever\\'scurrently in the pipeline.  Apple\\'srevenues may continue to rise for a long time, but as Microsoftshows, revenue is a lagging indicator in the technology business.So if Apple\\'s not going to make the next iPad, who is?  None of theexisting players.  None of them are run by product visionaries, andempirically you can\\'t seem to get those by hiring them.  Empiricallythe way you get a product visionary as CEO is for him to found thecompany and not get fired.  So the company that creates the nextwave of hardware is probably going to have to be a startup.I realize it sounds preposterously ambitious for a startup to tryto become as big as Apple.  But no more ambitious than it was forApple to become as big as Apple, and they did it.  Plus a startuptaking on this problem now has an advantage the original Appledidn\\'t: the example of Apple.  Steve Jobs has shown us what\\'spossible.  That helps would-be successors both directly, as RogerBannister did, by showing how much better you can do than peopledid before, and indirectly, as Augustus did, by lodging the ideain users\\' minds that a single person could unroll the future for them.Now Steve is gone there\\'s a vacuum we can all feel.  If a new companyled boldly into the future of hardware, users would follow.  TheCEO of that company, the \"next Steve Jobs,\" might not measure upto Steve Jobs. But he wouldn\\'t have to.  He\\'d just have to do abetter job than Samsung and HP and Nokia, and that seems prettydoable.6. Bring Back Moore\\'s LawThe last 10 years have reminded us what Moore\\'s Law actually says.Till about 2002 you could safely misinterpret it as promising thatclock speeds would double every 18 months.  Actually what it saysis that circuit densities will double every 18 months.  It used toseem pedantic to point that out.  Not any more.  Intel can no longergive us faster CPUs, just more of them.This Moore\\'s Law is not as good as the old one.  Moore\\'s Law usedto mean that if your software was slow, all you had to do was wait,and the inexorable progress of hardware would solve your problems.Now if your software is slow you have to rewrite it to do morethings in parallel, which is a lot more work than waiting.It would be great if a startup could give us something of the oldMoore\\'s Law back, by writing software that could make a large numberof CPUs look to the developer like one very fast CPU.  There areseveral ways to approach this problem.  The most ambitious is totry to do it automatically: to write a compiler that will parallelizeour code for us.  There\\'s a name for this compiler,the sufficientlysmart compiler,and it is a byword for impossibility.  But isit really impossible?  Is there no configuration of the bits inmemory of a present day computer that is this compiler?  If youreally think so, you should try to prove it, because that would bean interesting result.  And if it\\'s not impossible but simply veryhard, it might be worth trying to write it.  The expected valuewould be high even if the chance of succeeding was low.The reason the expected value is so high is web services.  If youcould write software that gave programmers the convenience of theway things were in the old days, you could offer it to them as aweb service.  And that would in turn mean that you got practicallyall the users.Imagine there was another processor manufacturer that could still translateincreased circuit densities into increased clock speeds. They\\'dtake most of Intel\\'s business.  And since web services mean thatno one sees their processors anymore, by writing the sufficientlysmart compiler you could create a situation indistinguishable fromyou being that manufacturer, at least for the server market.The least ambitious way of approaching the problem is to start fromthe other end, and offer programmers more parallelizable Lego blocksto build programs out of, like Hadoop and MapReduce.   Then theprogrammer still does much of the work of optimization.There\\'s an intriguing middle ground where you build a semi-automaticweapon—where there\\'s a human in the loop.  You make somethingthat looks to the user like the sufficiently smart compiler, butinside has people, using highly developed optimization tools tofind and eliminate bottlenecks in users\\' programs.   These peoplemight be your employees, or you might create a marketplace foroptimization.An optimization marketplace would be a way to generate the sufficientlysmart compiler piecemeal, because participants would immediatelystart writing bots.  It would be a curious state of affairs if youcould get to the point where everything could be done by bots,because then you\\'d have made the sufficiently smart compiler, butno one person would have a complete copy of it.I realize how crazy all this sounds.  In fact, what I like aboutthis idea is all the different ways in which it\\'s wrong.  The wholeidea of focusing on optimization is counter to the general trendin software development for the last several decades.  Trying towrite the sufficiently smart compiler is by definition a mistake.And even if it weren\\'t, compilers are the sort of software that\\'ssupposed to be created by open source projects, not companies.  Plusif this works it will deprive all the programmers who take pleasurein making multithreaded apps of so much amusing complexity. Theforum troll I have by now internalized doesn\\'t even know where tobegin in raising objections to this project.  Now that\\'s what Icall a startup idea.7. Ongoing DiagnosisBut wait, here\\'s another that could face even greater resistance:ongoing, automatic medical diagnosis.One of my tricks for generating startup ideas is to imagine theways in which we\\'ll seem backward to future generations.  And I\\'mpretty sure that to people 50 or 100 years in the future, it willseem barbaric that people in our era waited till they had symptomsto be diagnosed with conditions like heart disease and cancer.For example, in 2004 Bill Clinton found he was feeling short ofbreath.  Doctors discovered that several of his arteries were over90% blocked and 3 days later he had a quadruple bypass.  It seemsreasonable to assume Bill Clinton has the best medical care available.And yet even he had to wait till his arteries were over 90% blockedto learn that the number was over 90%.  Surely at some point in thefuture we\\'ll know these numbers the way we now know something likeour weight.  Ditto for cancer.  It will seem preposterous to futuregenerations that we wait till patients have physical symptoms tobe diagnosed with cancer.  Cancer will show up on some sort of radarscreen immediately.(Of course, what shows up on the radar screen may be different fromwhat we think of now as cancer.  I wouldn\\'t be surprised if at anygiven time we have ten or even hundreds of microcancers going atonce, none of which normally amount to anything.)A lot of the obstacles to ongoing diagnosis will come from the factthat it\\'s going against the grain of the medical profession.  Theway medicine has always worked is that patients come to doctorswith problems, and the doctors figure out what\\'s wrong.  A lot ofdoctors don\\'t like the idea of going on the medical equivalent ofwhat lawyers call a \"fishing expedition,\" where you go looking forproblems without knowing what you\\'re looking for.  They call thethings that get discovered this way \"incidentalomas,\" and they aresomething of a nuisance.For example, a friend of mine once had her brain scanned as partof a study.  She was horrified when the doctors running the studydiscovered what appeared to be a large tumor.  After further testing,it turned out to be a harmless cyst.  But it cost her a few daysof terror. A lot of doctors worry that if you start scanning peoplewith no symptoms, you\\'ll get this on a giant scale: a huge numberof false alarms that make patients panic and require expensive andperhaps even dangerous tests to resolve.  But I think that\\'s justan artifact of current limitations.  If people were scanned all thetime and we got better at deciding what was a real problem, myfriend would have known about this cyst her whole life and knownit was harmless, just as we do a birthmark.There is room for a lot of startups here.  In addition to the technical obstacles allstartups face, and the bureaucratic obstacles all medical startupsface, they\\'ll be going against thousands of years of medicaltradition.  But it will happen, and it will be a great thing—sogreat that people in the future will feel as sorry for us as we dofor the generations that lived before anaesthesia and antibiotics.TacticsLet me conclude with some tactical advice.  If you want to take ona problem as big as the ones I\\'ve discussed, don\\'t make a directfrontal attack on it.  Don\\'t say, for example, that you\\'re goingto replace email.  If you do that you raise too many expectations.Your employees and investors will constantly be asking \"are we thereyet?\" and you\\'ll have an army of haters waiting to see you fail.Just say you\\'re building todo-list software.  That sounds harmless.People can notice you\\'ve replaced email when it\\'s afait accompli.Empirically, the way to do really big things seems to be to startwith deceptively small things.  Want to dominate microcomputersoftware?  Start by writing a Basic interpreter for a machine witha few thousand users.  Want to make the universal web site?  Startby building a site for Harvard undergrads to stalk one another.Empirically, it\\'s not just for other people that you need to startsmall.  You need to for your own sake.  Neither Bill Gates nor MarkZuckerberg knew at first how big their companies were going to get.All they knew was that they were onto something.  Maybe it\\'s a badidea to have really big ambitions initially, because the biggeryour ambition, the longer it\\'s going to take, and the further youproject into the future, the more likely you\\'ll get it wrong.I think the way to use these big ideas is not to try to identify aprecise point in the future and then ask yourself how to get fromhere to there, like the popular image of a visionary.  You\\'ll bebetter off if you operate like Columbus and just head in a generalwesterly direction.  Don\\'t try to construct the future like abuilding, because your current blueprint is almost certainly mistaken.Start with something you know works, and when you expand, expandwestward.The popular image of the visionary is someone with a clear view ofthe future, but empirically it may be better to have a blurry one.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'Founder Control',\n",
       "  'date': 'Want to start a startup?',\n",
       "  'essay_text': \"Get funded byY Combinator.December 2010Someone we funded is talking to VCs now, and asked me how commonit was for a startup's founders to retain control of the board aftera series A round.  He said VCs told him this almost never happened.Ten years ago that was true.  In the past, founders rarely keptcontrol of the board through a series A.  The traditional series Aboard consisted of two founders, two VCs, and one independent member.More recently the recipe is often one founder, one VC, and oneindependent.  In either case the founders lose their majority.But not always.  Mark Zuckerberg kept control of Facebook's boardthrough the series A and still has it today.  Mark Pincus has keptcontrol of Zynga's too.  But are these just outliers?  How commonis it for founders to keep control after an A round?  I'd heard ofseveral cases among the companies we've funded, but I wasn't surehow many there were, so I emailed the ycfounders list.The replies surprised me.  In a dozen companies we've funded, thefounders still had a majority of the board seats after the seriesA round.I feel like we're at a tipping point here.  A lot of VCs still actas if founders retaining board control after a series A is unheard-of.A lot of them try to make you feel bad if you even ask — as ifyou're a noob or a control freak for wanting such a thing.  But thefounders I heard from aren't noobs or control freaks.  Or if theyare, they are, like Mark Zuckerberg, the kind of noobs and controlfreaks VCs should be trying to fund more of.Founders retaining control after a series A is clearly heard-of.And barring financial catastrophe, I think in the coming year itwill become the norm.Control of a company is a more complicated matter than simplyoutvoting other parties in board meetings.  Investors usually getvetos over certain big decisions, like selling the company, regardlessof how many board seats they have.  And board votes are rarelysplit.  Matters are decided in the discussion preceding the vote,not in the vote itself, which is usually unanimous.  But if opinionis divided in such discussions, the side that knows it would losein a vote will tend to be less insistent.  That's what board controlmeans in practice.  You don't simply get to do whatever you want;the board still has to act in the interest of the shareholders; butif you have a majority of board seats, then your opinion aboutwhat's in the interest of the shareholders will tend to prevail.So while board control is not total control, it's not imaginaryeither.  There's inevitably a difference in how things feel withinthe company.  Which means if it becomes the norm for founders toretain board control after a series A, that will change the waythings feel in the whole startup world.The switch to the new norm may be surprisingly fast, because thestartups that can retain control tend to be the best ones.  They'rethe ones that set the trends, both for other startups and for VCs.A lot of the reason VCs are harsh when negotiating with startupsis that they're embarrassed to go back to their partners lookinglike they got beaten.  When they sign a termsheet, they want to beable to brag about the good terms they got.  A lot of them don'tcare that much personally about whether founders keep board control.They just don't want to seem like they had to make concessions.Which means if letting the founders keep control stops being perceivedas a concession, it will rapidly become much more common.Like a lot of changes that have been forced on VCs, this changewon't turn out to be as big a problem as they might think. VCs willstill be able to convince; they just won't be able to compel.  Andthe startups where they have to resort to compulsion are not theones that matter anyway.  VCs make most of their money from a fewbig hits, and those aren't them.Knowing that founders will keep control of the board may even helpVCs pick better.  If they know they can't fire the founders, they'llhave to choose founders they can trust.  And that's who they shouldhave been choosing all along.\"},\n",
       " {'title': 'The Venture Capital Squeeze',\n",
       "  'date': 'November 2005',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'In the next few years, venture capital funds will find themselvessqueezed from four directions.  They\\'re already stuck with a seller\\'smarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of theBubble and still haven\\'t invested.  This by itself is not the endof the world.  In fact, it\\'s just a more extreme version of thenormin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, becauseit\\'s getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: opensource, which makes software free; Moore\\'s law, which makes hardwaregeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion freeif you\\'re good; and better languages, which make development a lotcheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggestexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,the only software that then supported secure http connections.  Wepaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg ofmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the softwarefor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our firstserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten timesas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm gotthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is thatprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, themedian languagehas.  At most startups ten yearsago, software development meant ten programmers writing code inC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Pythonor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups wouldoutsource their development to India.  I think a better model forthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his developmentto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applicationsare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And oneguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won\\'t wasteany time in meetings, and (b) since he\\'s probably a founder, he canpay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists nowoften want to give startups more money than the startups want totake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as oneVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half amillion, \"I don\\'t know what we\\'re going to do.  Maybe we\\'ll justhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund backto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn\\'tgoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.Sarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drasticallyincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in additionto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars ayear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporateofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would notwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an areawhere you can\\'t go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, andthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFOis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  IfSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  companies, that\\'s proof enough that it\\'s broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  Forall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Whichmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3man startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100million to acquire.   They didn\\'t mean to be in this business; it\\'sjust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize theycan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startupsthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don\\'twant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HRdepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,and that\\'s what the startup is in the early phase: concentratedsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google\\'s speaker at theStartup School.  They\\'re quiteexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the pointwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is thefirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the firstyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technologycompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have still more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of thepeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.Ordinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;it\\'s just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get richwhen you\\'re still working for salary.  Even if it\\'s the right thing   for your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.They need to do two things, one of which won\\'t surprise them, and  another that will seem an anathema.Let\\'s start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  loosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not todestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically deadwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now that technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearlywhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlingsare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of theeconomy.  Much of the economy\\'s growth is their growth.  I thinkmost politicians realize that.  But they don\\'t realize just how   fragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateraldamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make verylittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you\\'llhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,all that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in grad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  out partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs investin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the money goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly fromthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  Theydon\\'t want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goespublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they\\'llhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stockearly would generally be better for the company, because it wouldcause the founders\\' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with theVCs\\'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tendto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, wouldprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,while the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companiesearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid upfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than thesubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,they\\'d be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a biggeroutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at leasthalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   money.  So what if some of the money would go to the  founders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this isunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to workgrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VCinvestments is dictated by thestructureof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  investments go to work destroying the company rather than growingit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sellsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. The angels made a huge return on that investment, so they\\'re happy.And for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingnessof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than amotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partiallycash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: youare now competing directly with Google.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'The Anatomy of Determination',\n",
       "  'date': 'Want to start a startup?',\n",
       "  'essay_text': \"Get funded byY Combinator.September 2009Like all investors, we spend a lot of time trying to learn how topredict which startups will succeed.  We probably spend more timethinking about it than most, because we invest the earliest.Prediction is usually all we have to rely on.We learned quickly that the most important predictor of success isdetermination.  At first we thought it might be intelligence.Everyone likes to believe that's what makes startups succeed.  Itmakes a better story that a company won because its founders wereso smart.  The PR people and reporters who spread such storiesprobably believe them themselves.  But while it certainly helps tobe smart, it's not the deciding factor.  There are plenty of peopleas smart as Bill Gates who achieve nothing.In most domains, talent is overrated compared to determination—partlybecause it makes a better story, partly because it gives onlookersan excuse for being lazy, and partly because after a while determinationstarts to look like talent.I can't think of any field in which determination is overrated, butthe relative importance of determination and talent probably dovary somewhat.  Talent probably matters more in types of work thatare purer, in the sense that one is solving mostly a single typeof problem instead of many different types.   I suspect determinationwould not take you as far in math as it would in, say, organizedcrime.I don't mean to suggest by this comparison that types of work thatdepend more on talent are always more admirable.  Most people wouldagree it's more admirable to be good at math than memorizing longstrings of digits, even though the latter depends more on naturalability.Perhaps one reason people believe startup founders win by beingsmarter is that intelligence does matter more in technology startupsthan it used to in earlier types of companies.  You probably doneed to be a bit smarter to dominate Internet search than you hadto be to dominate railroads or hotels or newspapers.  And that'sprobably an ongoing trend.  But even in the highest of high techindustries, success still depends more on determination than brains.If determination is so important, can we isolate its components?Are some more important than others?  Are there some you cancultivate?The simplest form of determination is sheer willfulness.  When youwant something, you must have it, no matter what.A good deal of willfulness must be inborn, because it's common tosee families where one sibling has much more of it than another.Circumstances can alter it, but at the high end of the scale, natureseems to be more important than nurture.  Bad circumstances canbreak the spirit of a strong-willed person, but I don't think there'smuch you can do to make a weak-willed person stronger-willed.Being strong-willed is not enough, however.  You also have to behard on yourself.  Someone who was strong-willed but self-indulgentwould not be called determined.  Determination implies your willfulnessis balanced by discipline.That word balance is a significant one.  The more willful you are,the more disciplined you have to be.  The stronger your will, theless anyone will be able to argue with you except yourself.  Andsomeone has to argue with you, because everyone has base impulses,and if you have more will than discipline you'll just give intothem and end up on a local maximum like drug addiction.We can imagine will and discipline as two fingers squeezing aslippery melon seed.  The harder they squeeze, the further the seedflies, but they must both squeeze equally or the seed spins offsideways.If this is true it has interesting implications, because disciplinecan be cultivated, and in fact does tend to vary quite a lot in thecourse of an individual's life.  If determination is effectivelythe product of will and discipline, then you can become moredetermined by being more disciplined.Another consequence of the melon seed model is that the more willfulyou are, the more dangerous it is to be undisciplined.  There seemto be plenty of examples to confirm that.  In some very energeticpeople's lives you see something like wing flutter, where theyalternate between doing great work and doing absolutely nothing.Externally this would look a lot like bipolar disorder.The melon seed model is inaccurate in at least one respect, however:it's static.  In fact the dangers of indiscipline increase withtemptation.  Which means, interestingly, that determination tendsto erode itself.  If you're sufficiently determined to achieve greatthings, this will probably increase the number of temptations aroundyou.  Unless you become proportionally more disciplined, willfulnesswill then get the upper hand, and your achievement will revert tothe mean.That's why Shakespeare's Caesar thought thin men so dangerous.  They weren'ttempted by the minor perquisites of power.The melon seed model implies it's possible to be too disciplined.Is it?  I think there probably are people whose willfulness iscrushed down by excessive discipline, and who would achieve moreif they weren't so hard on themselves.  One reason the young sometimessucceed where the old fail is that they don't realize how incompetentthey are.  This lets them do a kind of deficit spending.  When theyfirst start working on something, they overrate their achievements.But that gives them confidence to keep working, and their performanceimproves.  Whereas someone clearer-eyed would see their initialincompetence for what it was, and perhaps be discouraged fromcontinuing.There's one other major component of determination: ambition.  Ifwillfulness and discipline are what get you to your destination,ambition is how you choose it.I don't know if it's exactly right to say that ambition is a componentof determination, but they're not entirely orthogonal.  It wouldseem a misnomer if someone said they were very determined to dosomething trivially easy.And fortunately ambition seems to be quite malleable; there's a lotyou can do to increase it.  Most people don't know how ambitiousto be, especially when they're young.  They don't know what's hard,or what they're capable of.  And this problem is exacerbated byhaving few peers.  Ambitious people are rare, so if everyone ismixed together randomly, as they tend to be early in people's lives,then the ambitious ones won't have many ambitious peers.  When youtake people like this and put them together with other ambitiouspeople, they bloom like dying plants given water.  Probably mostambitious people are starved for the sort of encouragement they'dget from ambitious peers, whatever their age.Achievements also tend to increase your ambition.  With each stepyou gain confidence to stretch further next time.So here in sum is how determination seems to work: it consists ofwillfulness balanced with discipline, aimed by ambition.   Andfortunately at least two of these three qualities can be cultivated.You may be able to increase your strength of will somewhat; you candefinitely learn self-discipline; and almost everyone is practicallymalnourished when it comes to ambition.I feel like I understand determination a bit better now.  But onlya bit: willfulness, discipline, and ambition are all concepts almostas complicated as determination.Note too that determination and talent are not the whole story.There's a third factor in achievement: how much you like the work.If you reallyloveworking on something,you don't need determination to drive you; it's what you'd do anyway.But most types of work have aspects one doesn't like, because mosttypes of work consist of doing things for other people, and it'svery unlikely that the tasks imposed by their needs will happen toalign exactly with what you want to do.Indeed, if you want to create the mostwealth,the way to do it is to focus more on their needs than your interests,and make up the difference with determination.\"},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.April 2005This summer, as an experiment, some friends and I are givingseedfundingto a bunch of new startups.  It\\'s an experiment becausewe\\'re prepared to fund younger founders than most investors would.That\\'s why we\\'re doing it during the summer—so even collegestudents can participate.We know from Google and Yahoo that grad students can start successfulstartups.  And we know from experience that some undergrads are ascapable as most grad students.  The accepted age for startup foundershas been creeping downward. We\\'re trying to find the lower bound.The deadline has now passed, and we\\'re sifting through 227 applications.We expected to divide them into two categories, promisingand unpromising.  But we soon saw we needed a third: promisingpeople with unpromising ideas.The Artix PhaseWe should have expected this.  It\\'s very common for a group offounders to go through one lame idea before realizing that a startuphas to make something people will pay for.   In fact, we ourselvesdid.Viaweb wasn\\'t the first startup Robert Morris and I started.  InJanuary 1995, we and a couple friends started a company calledArtix.  The plan was to put art galleries on the Web.  In retrospect,I wonder how we could have wasted our time on anything so stupid.Galleries are not especiallyexcitedabout being onthe Web even now, ten years later.  They don\\'t want to have theirstock visible to any random visitor, like an antique store.Besides which, art dealers are the most technophobic people onearth.  They didn\\'t become art dealers after a difficult choicebetween that and a career in the hard sciences.  Most of them hadnever seen the Web before we came to tell them why they should beon it.  Some didn\\'t even have computers.  It doesn\\'t do justice tothe situation to describe it as a hardsell; we soon sankto building sites for free, and it was hard to convince gallerieseven to do that.Gradually it dawned on us that instead of trying to make Web sites forpeople who didn\\'t want them, we could make sites forpeople who did.  In fact, software that would let people who wantedsites make their own.  So we ditched Artix andstarted a new company, Viaweb, to make software for building online stores.That one succeeded.We\\'re in good company here.  Microsoft was not the first companyPaul Allen and Bill Gates started either.  The first was calledTraf-o-data.It does not seem to have done as well as Micro-soft.In Robert\\'s defense, he was skeptical about Artix.  I dragged himinto it.But there were moments when he was optimistic.  Andif we, who were 29 and 30 at the time, could get excited about sucha thoroughly boneheaded idea, we should not be surprised that hackersaged 21 or 22 are pitching us ideas with little hope of making money.The Still Life EffectWhy does this happen?  Why do good hackers have bad business ideas?Let\\'s look at our case.  One reason we had such a lame idea wasthat it was the first thing we thought of.  I was in New York tryingto be a starving artist at the time (the starving part is actuallyquite easy), so I was haunting galleries anyway.  When I learnedabout the Web, it seemed natural to mix the two.  Make Web sitesfor galleries—that\\'s the ticket!If you\\'re going to spend years working on something, you\\'d thinkit might be wise to spend at least a couple days considering differentideas, instead of going with the first that comes into your head.You\\'d think.  But people don\\'t.  In fact, this is a constant problemwhen you\\'re painting still lifes.  You plonk down a bunch of stuffon a table, and maybe spend five or ten minutes rearranging it to look interesting.  But you\\'re so impatient to get started paintingthat ten minutes of rearranging feels very long.  So you startpainting.  Three days later, having spent twenty hours staring atit, you\\'re kicking yourself for having set up such an awkward and   boring composition, but by then it\\'s too late.Part of the problem is that big projects tend to grow out of smallones.  You set up a still life to make a quick sketch when you havea spare hour, and days later you\\'re still working on it.  I oncespent a month painting three versions of a still life I set up inabout four minutes.  At each point (a day, a week, a month) I thoughtI\\'d already put in so much time that it was too late to change.So the biggest cause of bad ideas is the still life effect:  you come up with a random idea, plunge into it, and then at each point(a day, a week, a month) feel you\\'ve put so much time into it thatthis must betheidea.How do we fix that?  I don\\'t think we should discard plunging.   Plunging into an idea is a good thing.  The solution is at the otherend: to realize that having invested time in something doesn\\'t makeit good.This is clearest in the case of names.  Viaweb was originallycalled Webgen, but we discovered someone else had a product calledthat.  We were so attached to our name that we offered him5%of the companyif he\\'d let us have it.   But he wouldn\\'t, sowe had to think of another.The best we could do was Viaweb,which we disliked at first.  It was like having a new mother.  But within three days we loved it, and Webgen sounded lame andold-fashioned.If it\\'s hard to change something so simple as a name, imaginehow hard it is to garbage-collect an idea.  A name only has one point of attachment into your head.  An idea for a company getswoven into your thoughts.  So you must consciously discount for   that.  Plunge in, by all means, but remember later to look at your   idea in the harsh light of morning and ask: is this something peoplewill pay for?  Is this, of all the things we could make, the thingpeople will pay most for?MuckThe second mistake we made with Artix is also very common.  Puttinggalleries on the Web seemed cool.One of the most valuable things my father taught me is an oldYorkshire saying: where there\\'s muck, there\\'s brass.  Meaning that unpleasant work pays.  And more to the point here, vice versa.  Workpeople like doesn\\'t pay well, for reasons of supply and demand.The most extreme case is developing programming languages, whichdoesn\\'t pay at all, because people like it so much they do it for free.When we started Artix, I was still ambivalent about business.  Iwanted to keep one foot in the art world.  Big, big, mistake.  Goinginto business is like a hang-glider launch: you\\'d better do it wholeheartedly, or not at all.  The purpose of a company, and astartup especially, is to make money.  You can\\'t have dividedloyalties.Which is not to say that you have to do the most disgusting sort  of work, like spamming, or starting a company whose only purpose  is patent litigation.  What I mean is, if you\\'re starting a companythat will do something cool, the aim had better be to make money and maybe be cool, not to be cool and maybe make money.It\\'s hard enough to make money that you can\\'t do it by accident.Unless it\\'s your first priority, it\\'s unlikely to happen at all.HyenasWhen I probe our motives with Artix, I see a third mistake: timidity.If you\\'d proposed at the time that we go into the e-commerce business,we\\'d have found the idea terrifying.  Surely a field like that wouldbe dominated by fearsome startups with five million dollars of VCmoney each.  Whereas we felt pretty sure that we could hold our ownin the slightly less competitive business of generating Web sites for art galleries.We erred ridiculously far on the side of safety.  As it turns out,VC-backed startups are not that fearsome.  They\\'re too busy tryingto spend all thatmoneyto get software written.  In 1995, thee-commerce business was very competitive as measured in pressreleases, but not as measured in software.  And really it neverwas.  The big fish like Open Market (rest their souls) were justconsulting companies pretending to be product companies, and  the offerings at our end of the market were a couple hundred linesof Perl scripts.  Or could have been implemented as a couple hundredlines of Perl; in fact they were probably tens of thousands of linesof C++ or Java.  Once we actually took the plunge into e-commerce,it turned out to be surprisingly easy to compete.So why were we afraid?  We felt we were good at programming, butwe lacked confidence in our ability to do a mysterious, undifferentiatedthing we called \"business.\"  In fact there is no such thing as\"business.\" There\\'s selling, promotion, figuring out what peoplewant, deciding how much to charge, customer support, paying yourbills, getting customers to pay you, getting incorporated, raisingmoney, and so on.  And the combination is not as hard as it seems,   because some tasks (like raising money and getting incorporated)are an O(1) pain in the ass, whether you\\'re big or small, and others(like selling and promotion) depend more on energy and imaginationthan any kind of special training.Artix was like a hyena, content to survive on carrion because wewere afraid of the lions.  Except the lions turned out not to have any teeth, and the business of putting galleries online barelyqualified as carrion.A Familiar ProblemSum up all these sources of error, and it\\'s no wonder we had sucha bad idea for a company.  We did the first thing we thought of;we were ambivalent about being in business at all; and we deliberatelychose an impoverished market to avoid competition.Looking at the applications for the Summer Founders Program, I seesigns of all three.  But the first is by far the biggest problem.  Most of the groups applying have not stopped to ask: of all the things we could do, isthisthe one with the best chance ofmaking money?If they\\'d already been through their Artix phase, they\\'d have learnedto ask that.  After the reception we got from art dealers, we wereready to.  This time, we thought, let\\'s make something people want.Reading theWall Street Journalfor a week should give anyoneideas for two or three new startups.  The articles are full ofdescriptions of problems that need to be solved.  But most of theapplicants don\\'t seem to have looked far for ideas.We expected the most common proposal to be for multiplayer games.We were not far off: this was the second most common. The most common was some combination of a blog, a calendar,a dating site, and Friendster.  Maybe there is some new killer appto be discovered here, but it seems perverse to go poking aroundin this fog when there are valuable, unsolved problems lying aboutin the open for anyone to see.  Why did no one propose a new scheme   for micropayments?  An ambitious project, perhaps, but I can\\'t    believe we\\'ve considered every alternative.  And newspapers andmagazines are (literally) dying for a solution.Why did so few applicants really think about what customers want?I think the problem with many, as with people in their early twentiesgenerally, is that they\\'ve been trained their whole lives to jumpthrough predefined hoops.  They\\'ve spent 15-20 years solving problemsother people have set for them.  And how much time deciding what  problems would be good to solve?  Two or three course projects?They\\'re good at solving problems, but bad at choosing them.But that, I\\'m convinced, is just the effect of training.  Or moreprecisely, the effect of grading.  To make grading efficient,everyone has to solve the same problem, and that means it has tobe decided in advance.  It would be great if schools taught studentshow to choose problems as well as how to solve them, but I don\\'tknow how you\\'d run such a class in practice.Copper and TinThe good news is, choosing problems is something that can be learned.I know that from experience.  Hackers can learn to make thingscustomers want.This is a controversial view.  One expert on \"entrepreneurship\"told me that any startup had to include business people, becauseonly they could focus on what customers wanted.  I\\'ll probablyalienate this guy forever by quoting him, but I have to risk it,because his email was such a perfect example of this view:80% of MIT spinoffs succeedprovidedthey   have at least one management person in the team at the start. The     business person represents the \"voice of the customer\" and that\\'s  what keeps the engineers and product development on track.This is, in my opinion, a crock.  Hackers are perfectly capable ofhearing the voice of the customer without a business person toamplify the signal for them.  Larry Page and Sergey Brin were gradstudents in computer science, which presumably makes them \"engineers.\"Do you suppose Google is only good because they had some businessguy whispering in their ears what customers wanted?   It seems to me the business guys who did the most for Google were the ones who obligingly flew Altavista into a hillside just as Google was gettingstarted.The hard part about figuring out what customers want is figuring out that you need to figure it out.  But that\\'s something you canlearn quickly.  It\\'s like seeing the other interpretation of anambiguous picture.  As soon as someone tells you there\\'s a rabbitas well as a duck, it\\'s hard not to see it.And compared to the sort of problems hackers are used to solving,giving customers what they want is easy.  Anyone who can write an optimizing compiler can design a UI that doesn\\'t confuse users, once theychooseto focus on that problem.  And once you   apply that kind of brain power to petty but profitable questions,     you can create wealth very rapidly.That\\'s the essence of a startup: having brilliant people do workthat\\'s beneath them.   Big companies try to hire the right personfor the job.  Startups win because they don\\'t—because they takepeople so smart that they would in a big company be doing \"research,\"and set them to work instead on problems of the most immediate andmundane sort.  Think Einstein designing refrigerators.If you want to learn what people want, readDale Carnegie\\'sHow to Win Friends and Influence People.When a friend recommended this book, I couldn\\'t believe he wasserious.  But he insisted it was good, so I read it, and he was   right.  It deals with the most difficult problem in human experience:how to see things from other people\\'s point of view, instead ofthinking only of yourself.Most smart people don\\'t do that very well.  But adding this abilityto raw brainpower is like adding tin to copper.  The result isbronze, which is so much harder that it seems a different metal.A hacker who has learned what to make, and not just how to make,is extraordinarily powerful.  And not just at making money: lookwhat a small group of volunteers has achieved with Firefox.Doing an Artix teaches you to make something people want in thesame way that not drinking anything would teach you how much youdepend on water.  But it would be more convenient for all involvedif the Summer Founders didn\\'t learn this on our dime—if they couldskip the Artix phase and go right on to make something customerswanted.  That, I think, is going to be the real experiment this summer.  How long will it take them to grasp this?We decidedwe ought to have T-Shirts for the SFP, and we\\'d been thinking about   what to print on the back.  Till now we\\'d been planning to useIf you can read this, I should be working.but now we\\'ve decided it\\'s going to beMake something people want.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'The Segway hasn\\'t delivered on its initial promise, to put it mildly.There are several reasons why, but one is that people don\\'t wantto be seen riding them. Someone riding a Segway looks like a dork.My friend Trevor Blackwell builthis own Segway, which we calledthe Segwell. He also built a one-wheeled version,the Eunicycle,which looks exactly like a regular unicycle till you realize therider isn\\'t pedaling.  He has ridden them both to downtown MountainView to get coffee.  When he rides the Eunicycle, people smile athim.  But when he rides the Segwell, they shout abuse from theircars: \"Too lazy to walk, ya fuckin homo?\"Why do Segways provoke this reaction?  The reason you look like adork riding a Segway is that you looksmug.  You don\\'t seem tobe working hard enough.Someone riding a motorcycle isn\\'t working any harder. But becausehe\\'s sitting astride it, he seems to be making an effort.  Whenyou\\'re riding a Segway you\\'re just standing there.  And someone who\\'sbeing whisked along while seeming to do no work — someone in a sedanchair, for example — can\\'t help but look smug.Try this thought experiment and it becomes clear: imagine somethingthat worked like the Segway, but that you rode with one foot infront of the other, like a skateboard.  That wouldn\\'t seem nearlyas uncool.So there may be a way to capture more of the market Segway hopedto reach: make a version that doesn\\'t look so easy for the rider.It would also be helpful if the styling was in the tradition ofskateboards or bicycles rather than medical devices.Curiously enough, what got Segway into this problem was that thecompany was itself a kind of Segway.  It was too easy for them;they were too successful raising money.  If they\\'d had to grow thecompany gradually, by iterating through several versions they soldto real users, they\\'d have learned pretty quickly that people lookedstupid riding them.

But if you have been, it probably madeyou wince.Restricted donations mean donations where the donor limits what canbe done with the money. This is common with big donations, perhapsthe default. And yet it\\'s usually a bad idea. Usually the way thedonor wants the money spent is not the way the nonprofit would havechosen. Otherwise there would have been no need to restrict thedonation. But who has a better understanding of where money needsto be spent, the nonprofit or the donor?If a nonprofit doesn\\'t understand better than its donors where moneyneeds to be spent, then it\\'s incompetent and you shouldn\\'t bedonating to it at all.Which means a restricted donation is inherently suboptimal. It\\'seither a donation to a bad nonprofit, or a donation for the wrongthings.There are a couple exceptions to this principle. One is when thenonprofit is an umbrella organization. It\\'s reasonable to make arestricted donation to a university, for example, because a universityis only nominally a single nonprofit. Another exception is when thedonor actually does know as much as the nonprofit about where moneyneeds to be spent. The Gates Foundation, for example, has specificgoals and often makes restricted donations to individual nonprofitsto accomplish them. But unless you\\'re a domain expert yourself ordonating to an umbrella organization, your donation would do moregood if it were unrestricted.If restricted donations do less good than unrestricted ones, whydo donors so often make them? Partly because doing good isn\\'t donors\\'only motive. They often have other motives as well — to make a mark,or to generate good publicity,or to comply with regulationsor corporate policies. Many donors may simply never have consideredthe distinction between restricted and unrestricted donations. Theymay believe that donating money for some specific purpose is justhow donation works. And to be fair, nonprofits don\\'t try very hardto discourage such illusions. They can\\'t afford to. People runningnonprofits are almost always anxious about money.

       "  'date': 'December 2019',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'The most damaging thing you learned in school wasn\\'t something youlearned in any specific class. It was learning to get good grades.When I was in college, a particularly earnest philosophy grad studentonce told me that he never cared what grade he got in a class, onlywhat he learned in it. This stuck in my mind because it was theonly time I ever heard anyone say such a thing.For me, as for most students, the measurement of what I was learningcompletely dominated actual learning in college.  I was fairlyearnest; I was genuinely interested in most of the classes I took,and I worked hard. And yet I worked by far the hardest when I wasstudying for a test.In theory, tests are merely what their name implies: tests of whatyou\\'ve learned in the class. In theory you shouldn\\'t have to preparefor a test in a class any more than you have to prepare for a bloodtest. In theory you learn from taking the class, from going to thelectures and doing the reading and/or assignments, and the testthat comes afterward merely measures how well you learned.In practice, as almost everyone reading this will know, things areso different that hearing this explanation of how classes and testsare meant to work is like hearing the etymology of a word whosemeaning has changed completely. In practice, the phrase \"studyingfor a test\" was almost redundant, because that was when one reallystudied.  The difference between diligent and slack students wasthat the former studied hard for tests and the latter didn\\'t.  Noone was pulling all-nighters two weeks into the semester.Even though I was a diligent student, almost all the work I did inschool was aimed at getting a good grade on something.To many people, it would seem strange that the preceding sentencehas a \"though\" in it. Aren\\'t I merely stating a tautology? Isn\\'tthat what a diligent student is, a straight-A student? That\\'s howdeeply the conflation of learning with grades has infused ourculture.Is it so bad if learning is conflated with grades?  Yes, it is bad.And it wasn\\'t till decades after college, when I was running Y\\xa0Combinator, that I realized how bad it is.I knew of course when I was a student that studying for a test isfar from identical with actual learning. At the very least, youdon\\'t retain knowledge you cram into your head the night before anexam. But the problem is worse than that. The real problem is thatmost tests don\\'t come close to measuring what they\\'re supposed to.If tests truly were tests of learning, things wouldn\\'t be so bad.Getting good grades and learning would converge, just a little late.The problem is that nearly all tests given to students are terriblyhackable. Most people who\\'ve gotten good grades know this, and knowit so well they\\'ve ceased even to question it.  You\\'ll see when yourealize how naive it sounds to act otherwise.Suppose you\\'re taking a class on medieval history and the finalexam is coming up. The final exam is supposed to be a test of yourknowledge of medieval history, right? So if you have a couple daysbetween now and the exam, surely the best way to spend the time,if you want to do well on the exam, is to read the best books youcan find about medieval history. Then you\\'ll know a lot about it,and do well on the exam.No, no, no, experienced students are saying to themselves.  If youmerely read good books on medieval history, most of the stuff youlearned wouldn\\'t be on the test.  It\\'s not good books you want toread, but the lecture notes and assigned reading in this class.And even most of that you can ignore, because you only have to worryabout the sort of thing that could turn up as a test question.You\\'re looking for sharply-defined chunks of information. If oneof the assigned readings has an interesting digression on somesubtle point, you can safely ignore that, because it\\'s not the sortof thing that could be turned into a test question.  But if theprofessor tells you that there were three underlying causes of theSchism of 1378, or three main consequences of the Black Death, you\\'dbetter know them. And whether they were in fact the causes orconsequences is beside the point.  For the purposes of this classthey are.At a university there are often copies of old exams floating around,and these narrow still further what you have to learn. As well aslearning what kind of questions this professor asks, you\\'ll oftenget actual exam questions. Many professors re-use them.  Afterteaching a class for 10 years, it would be hard not to, at leastinadvertently.In some classes, your professor will have had some sort of politicalaxe to grind, and if so you\\'ll have to grind it too. The need forthis varies. In classes in math or the hard sciences or engineeringit\\'s rarely necessary, but at the other end of the spectrum thereare classes where you couldn\\'t get a good grade without it.Getting a good grade in a class on x is so different from learninga lot about x that you have to choose one or the other, and youcan\\'t blame students if they choose grades.  Everyone judges themby their grades — graduate programs, employers, scholarships, eventheir own parents.I liked learning, and I really enjoyed some of the papers andprograms I wrote in college. But did I ever, after turning in apaper in some class, sit down and write another just for fun? Ofcourse not. I had things due in other classes. If it ever came toa choice of learning or grades, I chose grades. I hadn\\'t come tocollege to do badly.Anyone who cares about getting good grades has to play this game,or they\\'ll be surpassed by those who do. And at elite universities,that means nearly everyone, since someone who didn\\'t care aboutgetting good grades probably wouldn\\'t be there in the first place.The result is that students compete to maximize the differencebetween learning and getting good grades.Why are tests so bad? More precisely, why are they so hackable?Any experienced programmer could answer that. How hackable issoftware whose author hasn\\'t paid any attention to preventing itfrom being hacked? Usually it\\'s as porous as a colander.Hackable is the default for any test imposed by an authority. Thereason the tests you\\'re given are so consistently bad — so consistentlyfar from measuring what they\\'re supposed to measure — is simplythat the people creating them haven\\'t made much effort to preventthem from being hacked.But you can\\'t blame teachers if their tests are hackable. Their jobis to teach, not to create unhackable tests. The real problem isgrades, or more precisely, that grades have been overloaded. Ifgrades were merely a way for teachers to tell students what theywere doing right and wrong, like a coach giving advice to an athlete,students wouldn\\'t be tempted to hack tests. But unfortunately aftera certain age grades become more than advice. After a certain age,whenever you\\'re being taught, you\\'re usually also being judged.I\\'ve used college tests as an example, but those are actually theleast hackable. All the tests most students take their whole livesare at least as bad, including, most spectacularly of all, the testthat gets them into college. If getting into college were merely amatter of having the quality of one\\'s mind measured by admissionsofficers the way scientists measure the mass of an object, we couldtell teenage kids \"learn a lot\" and leave it at that.  You can tellhow bad college admissions are, as a test, from how unlike highschool that sounds. In practice, the freakishly specific nature ofthe stuff ambitious kids have to do in high school is directlyproportionate to the hackability of college admissions.  The classesyou don\\'t care about that are mostly memorization, the random\"extracurricular activities\" you have to participate in to showyou\\'re \"well-rounded,\" the standardized tests as artificial aschess, the \"essay\" you have to write that\\'s presumably meant to hitsome very specific target, but you\\'re not told what.As well as being bad in what it does to kids, this test is also badin the sense of being very hackable. So hackable that whole industrieshave grown up to hack it. This is the explicit purpose of test-prepcompanies and admissions counsellors, but it\\'s also a significantpart of the function of private schools.Why is this particular test so hackable? I think because of whatit\\'s measuring. Although the popular story is that the way to getinto a good college is to be really smart, admissions officers atelite colleges neither are, nor claim to be, looking only for that.What are they looking for?  They\\'re looking for people who are notsimply smart, but admirable in some more general sense.  And howis this more general admirableness measured?  The admissions officersfeel it. In other words, they accept who they like.So what college admissions is a test of is whether you suit thetaste of some group of people. Well, of course a test like that isgoing to be hackable. And because it\\'s both very hackable and there\\'s(thought to be) a lot at stake, it\\'s hacked like nothing else.That\\'s why it distorts your life so much for so long.It\\'s no wonder high school students often feel alienated. The shapeof their lives is completely artificial.But wasting your time is not the worst thing the educational systemdoes to you. The worst thing it does is to train you that the wayto win is by hacking bad tests.  This is a much subtler problemthat I didn\\'t recognize until I saw it happening to other people.When I started advising startup founders at Y Combinator, especiallyyoung ones, I was puzzled by the way they always seemed to makethings overcomplicated. How, they would ask, do you raise money?What\\'s the trick for making venture capitalists want to invest inyou? The best way to make VCs want to invest in you, I would explain,is to actually be a good investment. Even if you could trick VCsinto investing in a bad startup, you\\'d be tricking yourselves too.You\\'re investing time in the same company you\\'re asking them toinvest money in. If it\\'s not a good investment, why are you evendoing it?Oh, they\\'d say, and then after a pause to digest this revelation,they\\'d ask: What makes a startup a good investment?So I would explain that what makes a startup promising, not justin the eyes of investors but in fact, isgrowth.  Ideally in revenue,but failing that in usage. What they needed to do was get lots ofusers.How does one get lots of users? They had all kinds of ideas aboutthat. They needed to do a big launch that would get them \"exposure.\"They needed influential people to talk about them. They even knewthey needed to launch on a tuesday, because that\\'s when one getsthe most attention.No, I would explain, that is not how to get lots of users. The wayyou get lots of users is to make the product really great. Thenpeople will not only use it but recommend it to their friends, soyour growth will be exponential once youget it started.At this point I\\'ve told the founders something you\\'d think wouldbe completely obvious: that they should make a good company bymaking a good product. And yet their reaction would be somethinglike the reaction many physicists must have had when they firstheard about the theory of relativity: a mixture of astonishment atits apparent genius, combined with a suspicion that anything soweird couldn\\'t possibly be right. Ok, they would say, dutifully.And could you introduce us to such-and-such influential person? Andremember, we want to launch on Tuesday.It would sometimes take founders years to grasp these simple lessons.And not because they were lazy or stupid. They just seemed blindto what was right in front of them.Why, I would ask myself, do they always make things so complicated?And then one day I realized this was not a rhetorical question.Why did founders tie themselves in knots doing the wrong thingswhen the answer was right in front of them? Because that was whatthey\\'d been trained to do. Their education had taught them that theway to win was to hack the test. And without even telling them theywere being trained to do this. The younger ones, the recent graduates,had never faced a non-artificial test. They thought this was justhow the world worked: that the first thing you did, when facing anykind of challenge, was to figure out what the trick was for hackingthe test. That\\'s why the conversation would always start with howto raise money, because that read as the test. It came at the endof YC. It had numbers attached to it, and higher numbers seemed tobe better. It must be the test.There are certainly big chunks of the world where the way to winis to hack the test. This phenomenon isn\\'t limited to schools.  Andsome people, either due to ideology or ignorance, claim that thisis true of startups too. But it isn\\'t. In fact, one of the moststriking things about startups is the degree to which you win bysimply doing good work. There are edge cases, as there are inanything, but in general you win by getting users, and what userscare about is whether the product does what they want.Why did it take me so long to understand why founders made startupsovercomplicated? Because I hadn\\'t realized explicitly that schoolstrain us to win by hacking bad tests. And not just them, but me!I\\'d been trained to hack bad tests too, and hadn\\'t realized it tilldecades later.I had lived as if I realized it, but without knowing why. Forexample, I had avoided working for big companies. But if you\\'d askedwhy, I\\'d have said it was because they were bogus, or bureaucratic.Or just yuck. I never understood how much of my dislike of bigcompanies was due to the fact that you win by hacking bad tests.Similarly, the fact that the tests were unhackable was a lot ofwhat attracted me to startups. But again, I hadn\\'t realized thatexplicitly.I had in effect achieved by successive approximations somethingthat may have a closed-form solution.  I had gradually undone mytraining in hacking bad tests without knowing I was doing it.  Couldsomeone coming out of school banish this demon just by knowing itsname, and saying begone? It seems worth trying.Merely talking explicitly about this phenomenon is likely to makethings better, because much of its power comes from the fact thatwe take it for granted. After you\\'ve noticed it, it seems theelephant in the room, but it\\'s a pretty well camouflaged elephant.The phenomenon is so old, and so pervasive. And it\\'s simply theresult of neglect. No one meant things to be this way. This is justwhat happens when you combine learning with grades, competition,and the naive assumption of unhackability.It was mind-blowing to realize that two of the things I\\'d puzzledabout the most — the bogusness of high school, and the difficultyof getting founders to see the obvious — both had the same cause.It\\'s rare for such a big block to slide into place so late.Usually when that happens it has implications in a lot of differentareas, and this case seems no exception. For example, it suggestsboth that education could be done better, and how you might fix it.But it also suggests a potential answer to the question all bigcompanies seem to have: how can we be more like a startup? I\\'m notgoing to chase down all the implications now. What I want to focuson here is what it means for individuals.To start with, it means that most ambitious kids graduating fromcollege have something they may want to unlearn.  But it also changeshow you look at the world. Instead of looking at all the differentkinds of work people do and thinking of them vaguely as more orless appealing, you can now ask a very specific question that willsort them in an interesting way: to what extent do you win at thiskind of work by hacking bad tests?It would help if there was a way to recognize bad tests quickly.Is there a pattern here? It turns out there is.Tests can be divided into two kinds: those that are imposed byauthorities, and those that aren\\'t.  Tests that aren\\'t imposed byauthorities are inherently unhackable, in the sense that no one isclaiming they\\'re tests of anything more than they actually test. Afootball match, for example, is simply a test of who wins, not whichteam is better. You can tell that from the fact that commentatorssometimes say afterward that the better team won. Whereas testsimposed by authorities are usually proxies for something else. Atest in a class is supposed to measure not just how well you didon that particular test, but how much you learned in the class.While tests that aren\\'t imposed by authorities are inherentlyunhackable, those imposed by authorities have to be made unhackable.Usually they aren\\'t.  So as a first approximation, bad tests areroughly equivalent to tests imposed by authorities.You might actually like to win by hacking bad tests. Presumablysome people do. But I bet most people who find themselves doingthis kind of work don\\'t like it. They just take it for granted thatthis is how the world works, unless you want to drop out and besome kind of hippie artisan.I suspect many people implicitly assume that working in afield with bad tests is the price of making lots of money. But that,I can tell you, is false. It used to be true. In the mid-twentiethcentury, when the economy wascomposed of oligopolies, the only wayto the top was by playing their game. But it\\'s not true now.  Thereare now ways to get rich by doing good work, and that\\'s part of thereason people are so much more excited about getting rich than theyused to be. When I was a kid, you could either become an engineerand make cool things, or make lots of money by becoming an \"executive.\"Now you can make lots of money by making cool things.Hacking bad tests is becoming less important as the link betweenwork and authority erodes. The erosion of that link is one of themost important trends happening now, and we see its effects inalmost every kind of work people do. Startups are one of the mostvisible examples, but we see much the same thing in writing. Writersno longer have to submit to publishers and editors to reach readers;now they can go direct.The more I think about this question, the more optimistic I get.This seems one of those situations where we don\\'t realize how muchsomething was holding us back until it\\'s eliminated. And I canforesee the whole bogus edifice crumbling. Imagine what happens asmore and more people start to ask themselves if they want to winby hacking bad tests, and decide that they don\\'t.  The kinds ofwork where you win by hacking bad tests will be starved of talent,and the kinds where you win by doing good work will see an influxof the most ambitious people. And as hacking bad tests shrinks inimportance, education will evolve to stop training us to do it.Imagine what the world could look like if that happened.This is not just a lesson for individuals to unlearn, but one forsociety to unlearn, and we\\'ll be amazed at the energy that\\'s liberatedwhen we do.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'As I was deciding what to write about next, I was surprised to findthat two separate essays I\\'d been planning to write were actuallythe same.The first is about how to ace your Y Combinator interview. Therehas been so much nonsense written about this topic that I\\'ve beenmeaning for years to write something telling founders the truth.The second is about something politicians sometimes say — that theonly way to become a billionaire is by exploiting people — and whythis is mistaken.Keep reading, and you\\'ll learn both simultaneously.I know the politicians are mistaken because it was my job to predictwhich people will become billionaires. I think I can truthfully saythat I know as much about how to do this as anyone. If the key tobecoming a billionaire — the defining feature of billionaires —was to exploit people, then I, as a professional billionaire scout,would surely realize this and look for people who would be good atit, just as an NFL scout looks for speed in wide receivers.But aptitude for exploiting people is not what Y Combinator looksfor at all. In fact, it\\'s the opposite of what they look for. I\\'lltell you what they do look for, by explaining how to convince Y\\xa0Combinator to fund you, and you can see for yourself.What YC looks for, above all, is founders who understand some groupof users and can make what they want. This is so important thatit\\'s YC\\'s motto: \"Make something people want.\"A big company can to some extent force unsuitable products onunwilling customers, but a startup doesn\\'t have the power to dothat. A startup must sing for its supper, by making things thatgenuinely delight its customers. Otherwise it will never get offthe ground.Here\\'s where things get difficult, both for you as a founder andfor the YC partners trying to decide whether to fund you. In amarket economy, it\\'s hard to make something people want that theydon\\'t already have. That\\'s the great thing about market economies.If other people both knew about this need and were able to satisfyit, they already would be, and there would be no room for yourstartup.Which means the conversation during your YC interview will have tobe about something new: either a new need, or a new way to satisfyone. And not just new, but uncertain. If it were certain that theneed existed and that you could satisfy it, that certainty wouldbe reflected in large and rapidly growing revenues, and you wouldn\\'tbe seeking seed funding.So the YC partners have to guess both whether you\\'ve discovered areal need, and whether you\\'ll be able to satisfy it. That\\'s what theyare, at least in this part of their job: professional guessers.They have 1001 heuristics for doing this, and I\\'m not going to tellyou all of them, but I\\'m happy to tell you the most important ones,because these can\\'t be faked; the only way to \"hack\" them would beto do what you should be doing anyway as a founder.The first thing the partners will try to figure out, usually, iswhether what you\\'re making will ever be something a lot of peoplewant. It doesn\\'t have to be something a lot of people want now.The product and the market will both evolve, and will influenceeach other\\'s evolution. But in the end there has to be somethingwith a huge market. That\\'s what the partners will be trying tofigure out: is there a path to a huge market?Sometimes it\\'s obvious there will be a huge market. IfBoommanagesto ship an airliner at all, international airlines will have to buyit. But usually it\\'s not obvious. Usually the path to a huge marketis by growing a small market. This idea is important enough thatit\\'s worth coining a phrase for, so let\\'s call one of these smallbut growable markets a \"larval market.\"The perfect example of a larval market might be Apple\\'s market whenthey were founded in 1976. In 1976, not many people wanted theirown computer. But more and more started to want one, till now every10 year old on the planet wants a computer (but calls it a \"phone\").The ideal combination is the group of founders who are\"living inthe future\"in the sense of being at the leading edge of some kindof change, and who are building something they themselves want.Most super-successful startups are of this type. Steve Wozniakwanted a computer. Mark Zuckerberg wanted to engage online with hiscollege friends. Larry and Sergey wanted to find things on the web.All these founders were building things they and their peers wanted,and the fact that they were at the leading edge of change meantthat more people would want these things in the future.But although the ideal larval market is oneself and one\\'s peers,that\\'s not the only kind. A larval market might also be regional,for example. You build something to serve one location, and thenexpand to others.The crucial feature of the initial market is that it exist. Thatmay seem like an obvious point, but the lack of it is the biggestflaw in most startup ideas. There have to be some people who wantwhat you\\'re building right now, and want it so urgently that they\\'rewilling to use it, bugs and all, even though you\\'re a small companythey\\'ve never heard of. There don\\'t have to be many, but there haveto be some. As long as you have some users, there are straightforwardways to get more: build new features they want, seek out more peoplelike them, get them to refer you to their friends, and so on. Butthese techniques all require some initial seed group of users.So this is one thing the YC partners will almost certainly dig intoduring your interview. Who are your first users going to be, andhow do you know they want this? If I had to decide whether to fundstartups based on a single question, it would be \"How do you knowpeople want this?\"The most convincing answer is \"Because we and our friends want it.\"It\\'s even better when this is followed by the news that you\\'vealready built a prototype, and even though it\\'s very crude, yourfriends are using it, and it\\'s spreading by word of mouth. If youcan say that and you\\'re not lying, the partners will switch fromdefault no to default yes. Meaning you\\'re in unless there\\'s someother disqualifying flaw.That is a hard standard to meet, though. Airbnb didn\\'t meet it.They had the first part. They had made something they themselveswanted. But it wasn\\'t spreading. So don\\'t feel bad if you don\\'t hitthis gold standard of convincingness. If Airbnb didn\\'t hit it, itmust be too high.In practice, the YC partners will be satisfied if they feel thatyou have a deep understanding of your users\\' needs. And the Airbnbsdid have that. They were able to tell us all about what motivatedhosts and guests. They knew from first-hand experience, becausethey\\'d been the first hosts. We couldn\\'t ask them a question theydidn\\'t know the answer to. We ourselves were not very excited aboutthe idea as users, but we knew this didn\\'t prove anything, becausethere were lots of successful startups we hadn\\'t been excited aboutas users. We were able to say to ourselves \"They seem to know whatthey\\'re talking about. Maybe they\\'re onto something. It\\'s not growingyet, but maybe they can figure out how to make it grow during YC.\"Which they did, about three weeks into the batch.The best thing you can do in a YC interview is to teach the partnersabout your users. So if you want to prepare for your interview, one of the best ways to do it is to go talk to your users and find out exactly whatthey\\'re thinking. Which is what you should be doing anyway.This may sound strangely credulous, but the YC partners want torely on the founders to tell them about the market. Think abouthow VCs typically judge the potential market for an idea. They\\'renot ordinarily domain experts themselves, so they forward the ideato someone who is, and ask for their opinion. YC doesn\\'t have timeto do this, but if the YC partners can convince themselves that thefounders both (a) know what they\\'re talking about and (b) aren\\'tlying, they don\\'t need outside domain experts. They can use thefounders themselves as domain experts when evaluating their ownidea.This is why YC interviews aren\\'t pitches. To give as many foundersas possible a chance to get funded, we made interviews as short aswe could: 10 minutes. That is not enough time for the partners tofigure out, through the indirect evidence in a pitch, whether youknow what you\\'re talking about and aren\\'t lying. They need to digin and ask you questions. There\\'s not enough time for sequentialaccess. They need random access.The worst advice I ever heard about how to succeed in a YC interviewis that you should take control of the interview and make sure todeliver the message you want to. In other words, turn the interviewinto a pitch. ⟨elaborate expletive⟩. It is so annoying when peopletry to do that. You ask them a question, and instead of answeringit, they deliver some obviously prefabricated blob of pitch. Iteats up 10 minutes really fast.There is no one who can give you accurate advice about what to doin a YC interview except a current or former YC partner. Peoplewho\\'ve merely been interviewed, even successfully, have no idea ofthis, but interviews take all sorts of different forms dependingon what the partners want to know about most. Sometimes they\\'re allabout the founders, other times they\\'re all about the idea. Sometimessome very narrow aspect of the idea. Founders sometimes walk awayfrom interviews complaining that they didn\\'t get to explain theiridea completely. True, but they explained enough.Since a YC interview consists of questions, the way to do it wellis to answer them well. Part of that is answering them candidly.The partners don\\'t expect you to know everything. But if you don\\'tknow the answer to a question, don\\'t try to bullshit your way outof it. The partners, like most experienced investors, are professionalbullshit detectors, and you are (hopefully) an amateur bullshitter.And if you try to bullshit them and fail, they may not even tellyou that you failed. So it\\'s better to be honest than to try tosell them. If you don\\'t know the answer to a question, say youdon\\'t, and tell them how you\\'d go about finding it, or tell themthe answer to some related question.If you\\'re asked, for example, what could go wrong, the worst possibleanswer is \"nothing.\" Instead of convincing them that your idea isbullet-proof, this will convince them that you\\'re a fool or a liar.Far better to go into gruesome detail. That\\'s what experts do whenyou ask what could go wrong.  The partners know that your idea isrisky. That\\'s what a good bet looks like at this stage: a tinyprobability of a huge outcome.Ditto if they ask about competitors. Competitors are rarely whatkills startups. Poor execution does. But you should know who yourcompetitors are, and tell the YC partners candidly what your relativestrengths and weaknesses are. Because the YC partners know thatcompetitors don\\'t kill startups, they won\\'t hold competitors againstyou too much. They will, however, hold it against you if you seemeither to be unaware of competitors, or to be minimizing the threatthey pose. They may not be sure whether you\\'re clueless or lying,but they don\\'t need to be.The partners don\\'t expect your idea to be perfect. This is seedinvesting. At this stage, all they can expect are promising hypotheses.But they do expect you to be thoughtful and honest. So if tryingto make your idea seem perfect causes you to come off as glib orclueless, you\\'ve sacrificed something you needed for something youdidn\\'t.If the partners are sufficiently convinced that there\\'s a path toa big market, the next question is whether you\\'ll be able to findit. That in turn depends on three things: the general qualities ofthe founders, their specific expertise in this domain, and therelationship between them. How determined are the founders? Arethey good at building things? Are they resilient enough to keepgoing when things go wrong? How strong is their friendship?Though the Airbnbs only did ok in the idea department, they didspectacularly well in this department. The story of how they\\'dfunded themselves by making Obama- and McCain-themed breakfastcereal was the single most important factor in our decision to fundthem. They didn\\'t realize it at the time, but what seemed to theman irrelevant story was in fact fabulously good evidence of theirqualities as founders. It showed they were resourceful and determined,and could work together.It wasn\\'t just the cereal story that showed that, though. The wholeinterview showed that they cared. They weren\\'t doing this just forthe money, or because startups were cool. The reason they wereworking so hard on this company was because it was their project.They had discovered an interesting new idea, and they just couldn\\'tlet it go.Mundane as it sounds, that\\'s the most powerful motivator of all,not just in startups, but in most ambitious undertakings: to begenuinely interestedin what you\\'re building. This is what reallydrives billionaires, or at least the ones who become billionairesfrom starting companies. The company is their project.One thing few people realize about billionaires is that all of themcould have stopped sooner. They could have gotten acquired, or foundsomeone else to run the company. Many founders do. The ones whobecome really rich are the ones who keep working. And what makesthem keep working is not just money. What keeps them working is thesame thing that keeps anyone else working when they could stop ifthey wanted to: that there\\'s nothing else they\\'d rather do.That, not exploiting people, is the defining quality of people whobecome billionaires from starting companies. So that\\'s what YC looksfor in founders: authenticity. People\\'s motives for starting startupsare usually mixed. They\\'re usually doing it from some combinationof the desire to make money, the desire to seem cool, genuineinterest in the problem, and unwillingness to work for someone else.The last two are more powerful motivators than the first two. It\\'sok for founders to want to make money or to seem cool. Most do.But if the founders seem like they\\'re doing itjustto make moneyorjustto seem cool, they\\'re not likely to succeed on a bigscale. The founders who are doing it for the money will take thefirst sufficiently large acquisition offer, and the ones who aredoing it to seem cool will rapidly discover that there are muchless painful ways of seeming cool.Y Combinator certainly sees founders whose m.o. is to exploit people.YC is a magnet for them, because they want the YC brand. But whenthe YC partners detect someone like that, they reject them. If badpeople made good founders, the YC partners would face a moraldilemma. Fortunately they don\\'t, because bad people make bad founders.This exploitative type of founder is not going to succeed on a largescale, and in fact probably won\\'t even succeed on a small one,because they\\'re always going to be taking shortcuts. They see YCitself as a shortcut.Their exploitation usually begins with their own cofounders, whichis disastrous, since the cofounders\\' relationship is the foundationof the company. Then it moves on to the users, which is alsodisastrous, because the sort of early adopters a successful startupwants as its initial users are the hardest to fool. The best thiskind of founder can hope for is to keep the edifice of deceptiontottering along until some acquirer can be tricked into buying it.But that kind of acquisition is never very big.If professional billionaire scouts know that exploiting people isnot the skill to look for, why do some politicians think this isthe defining quality of billionaires?I think they start from the feeling that it\\'s wrong that one personcould have so much more money than another. It\\'s understandablewhere that feeling comes from. It\\'s in our DNA, and even in the DNAof other species.If they limited themselves to saying that it made them feel badwhen one person had so much more money than other people, who woulddisagree? It makes me feel bad too, and I think people who make alot of money have a moral obligation to use it for the common good.The mistake they make is to jump from feeling bad that some peopleare much richer than others to the conclusion that there\\'s nolegitimate way to make a very large amount of money. Now we\\'regetting into statements that are not only falsifiable, but false.There are certainly some people who become rich by doing bad things.But there are also plenty of people who behave badly and don\\'t makethat much from it. There is no correlation — in fact, probably aninverse correlation — between how badly you behave and how muchmoney you make.The greatest danger of this nonsense may not even be that it sendspolicy astray, but that it misleads ambitious people. Can you imaginea better way to destroy social mobility than by telling poor kidsthat the way to get rich is by exploiting people, while the richkids know, from having watched the preceding generation do it, howit\\'s really done?I\\'ll tell you how it\\'s really done, so you can at least tell yourown kids the truth. It\\'s all about users. The most reliable way tobecome a billionaire is to start a company thatgrows fast, and theway to grow fast is to make what users want. Newly started startupshave no choice but to delight users, or they\\'ll never even getrolling. But this never stops being the lodestar, and bigger companiestake their eye off it at their peril. Stop delighting users, andeventually someone else will.Users are what the partners want toknow about in YC interviews, and what I want to know about when Italk to founders that we funded ten years ago and who are billionairesnow. What do users want? What new things could you build for them?Founders who\\'ve become billionaires are always eager to talk aboutthat topic. That\\'s how they became billionaires.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Every year since 1982,Forbesmagazine has published a list of the\\rrichest Americans. If we compare the 100 richest people in 1982 to\\rthe 100 richest in 2020, we notice some big differences.In 1982 the most common source of wealth was inheritance. Of the\\r100 richest people, 60 inherited from an ancestor. There were 10\\rdu Pont heirs alone. By 2020 the number of heirs had been cut in\\rhalf, accounting for only 27 of the biggest 100 fortunes.Why would the percentage of heirs decrease? Not because inheritance\\rtaxes increased. In fact, they decreased significantly during this\\rperiod. The reason the percentage of heirs has decreased is not\\rthat fewer people are inheriting great fortunes, but that more\\rpeople are making them.How are people making these new fortunes? Roughly 3/4 by starting\\rcompanies and 1/4 by investing. Of the 73 new fortunes in 2020, 56\\rderive from founders\\' or early employees\\' equity (52 founders, 2\\rearly employees, and 2 wives of founders), and 17 from managing\\rinvestment funds.There were no fund managers among the 100 richest Americans in 1982.\\rHedge funds and private equity firms existed in 1982, but none of\\rtheir founders were rich enough yet to make it into the top 100.\\rTwo things changed: fund managers discovered new ways to generate\\rhigh returns, and more investors were willing to trust them with\\rtheir money.But the main source of new fortunes now is starting companies, and\\rwhen you look at the data, you see big changes there too. People\\rget richer from starting companies now than they did in 1982, because\\rthe companies do different things.In 1982, there were two dominant sources of new wealth: oil and\\rreal estate. Of the 40 new fortunes in 1982, at least 24 were due\\rprimarily to oil or real estate. Now only a small number are: of\\rthe 73 new fortunes in 2020, 4 were due to real estate and only 2\\rto oil.By 2020 the biggest source of new wealth was what are sometimes\\rcalled \"tech\" companies. Of the 73 new fortunes, about 30 derive\\rfrom such companies. These are particularly common among the richest\\rof the rich: 8 of the top 10 fortunes in 2020 were new fortunes of\\rthis type.Arguably it\\'s slightly misleading to treat tech as a category.\\rIsn\\'t Amazon really a retailer, and Tesla a car maker? Yes and no.\\rMaybe in 50 years, when what we call tech is taken for granted, it\\rwon\\'t seem right to put these two businesses in the same category.\\rBut at the moment at least, there is definitely something they share\\rin common that distinguishes them. What retailer starts AWS? What\\rcar maker is run by someone who also has a rocket company?The tech companies behind the top 100 fortunes also form a\\rwell-differentiated group in the sense that they\\'re all companies\\rthat venture capitalists would readily invest in, and the others\\rmostly not. And there\\'s a reason why: these are mostly companies\\rthat win by having better technology, rather than just a CEO who\\'s\\rreally driven and good at making deals.To that extent, the rise of the tech companies represents a qualitative\\rchange. The oil and real estate magnates of the 1982 Forbes 400\\rdidn\\'t win by making better technology. They won by being really\\rdriven and good at making deals.And indeed, that way of\\rgetting rich is so old that it predates the Industrial Revolution.\\rThe courtiers who got rich in the (nominal) service of European\\rroyal houses in the 16th and 17th centuries were also, as a rule,\\rreally driven and good at making deals.People who don\\'t look any deeper than the Gini coefficient look\\rback on the world of 1982 as the good old days, because those who\\rgot rich then didn\\'t get as rich. But if you dig intohowthey\\rgot rich, the old days don\\'t look so good. In 1982, 84% of the\\rrichest 100 people got rich by inheritance, extracting natural\\rresources, or doing real estate deals. Is that really better than\\ra world in which the richest people get rich by starting tech\\rcompanies?Why are people starting so many more new companies than they used\\rto, and why are they getting so rich from it? The answer to the\\rfirst question, curiously enough, is that it\\'s misphrased. We\\rshouldn\\'t be asking why people are starting companies, but why\\rthey\\'re starting companiesagain.In 1892, theNew York Herald Tribunecompiled a list of all the\\rmillionaires in America. They found 4047 of them. How many had\\rinherited their wealth then? Only about 20%, which is less than the\\rproportion of heirs today. And when you investigate the sources of\\rthe new fortunes, 1892 looks even more like today. Hugh Rockoff\\rfound that \"many of the richest ... gained their initial edge from\\rthe new technology of mass production.\"So it\\'s not 2020 that\\'s the anomaly here, but 1982. The real question\\ris why so few people had gotten rich from starting companies in\\r1982. And the answer is that even as theHerald Tribune\\'s list was\\rbeing compiled, a wave ofconsolidationwas sweeping through the\\rAmerican economy. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries,\\rfinanciers like J. P. Morgan combined thousands of smaller companies\\rinto a few hundred giant ones with commanding economies of scale.\\rBy the end of World War II, as Michael Lind writes, \"the major\\rsectors of the economy were either organized as government-backed\\rcartels or dominated by a few oligopolistic corporations.\"In 1960, most of the people who start startups today would have\\rgone to work for one of them. You could get rich from starting your\\rown company in 1890 and in 2020, but in 1960 it was not really a\\rviable option. You couldn\\'t break through the oligopolies to get\\rat the markets. So the prestigious route in 1960 was not to start\\ryour own company, but to work your way up the corporate ladder at\\ran existing one.Making everyone a corporate employee decreased economic inequality\\r(and every other kind of variation), but if your model of normal\\ris the mid 20th century, you have a very misleading model in that\\rrespect. J. P. Morgan\\'s economy turned out to be just a phase, and\\rstarting in the 1970s, it began to break up.Why did it break up? Partly senescence. The big companies that\\rseemed models of scale and efficiency in 1930 had by 1970 become\\rslack and bloated. By 1970 the rigid structure of the economy was\\rfull of cosy nests that various groups had built to insulate\\rthemselves from market forces. During the Carter administration the\\rfederal government realized something was amiss and began, in a\\rprocess they called \"deregulation,\" to roll back the policies that\\rpropped up the oligopolies.But it wasn\\'t just decay from within that broke up J. P. Morgan\\'s\\reconomy. There was also pressure from without, in the form of new\\rtechnology, and particularly microelectronics. The best way to\\renvision what happened is to imagine a pond with a crust of ice on\\rtop. Initially the only way from the bottom to the surface is around\\rthe edges. But as the ice crust weakens, you start to be able to\\rpunch right through the middle.The edges of the pond were pure tech: companies that actually\\rdescribed themselves as being in the electronics or software business.\\rWhen you used the word \"startup\" in 1990, that was what you meant.\\rBut now startups are punching right through the middle of the ice\\rcrust and displacing incumbents like retailers and TV networks and\\rcar companies.But though the breakup of J. P. Morgan\\'s economy created a new world\\rin the technological sense, it was a reversion to the norm in the\\rsocial sense. If you only look back as far as the mid 20th century,\\rit seems like people getting rich by starting their own companies\\ris a recent phenomenon. But if you look back further, you realize\\rit\\'s actually the default. So what we should expect in the future\\ris more of the same. Indeed, we should expect both the number and\\rwealth of founders to grow, because every decade it gets easier to\\rstart a startup.Part of the reason it\\'s getting easier to start a startup is social.\\rSociety is (re)assimilating the concept. If you start one now, your\\rparents won\\'t freak out the way they would have a generation ago,\\rand knowledge about how to do it is much more widespread. But the\\rmain reason it\\'s easier to start a startup now is that it\\'s cheaper.\\rTechnology has driven down the cost of both building products and\\racquiring customers.The decreasing cost of starting a startup has in turn changed the\\rbalance of power between founders and investors. Back when starting\\ra startup meant building a factory, you needed investors\\' permission\\rto do it at all. But now investors need founders more than founders\\rneed investors, and that, combined with the increasing amount of\\rventure capital available, has driven up valuations.So the decreasing cost of starting a startup increases the number\\rof rich people in two ways: it means that more people start them,\\rand that those who do can raise money on better terms.But there\\'s also a third factor at work: the companies themselves\\rare more valuable, because newly founded companies grow faster than\\rthey used to. Technology hasn\\'t just made it cheaper to build and\\rdistribute things, but faster too.This trend has been running for a long time. IBM, founded in 1896,\\rtook 45 years to reach a billion 2020 dollars in revenue.\\rHewlett-Packard, founded in 1939, took 25 years. Microsoft, founded\\rin 1975, took 13 years. Now the norm for fast-growing companies is\\r7 or 8 years.Fast growth has a double effect on the value of founders\\' stock.\\rThe value of a company is a function of its revenue and its growth\\rrate. So if a company grows faster, you not only get to a billion\\rdollars in revenue sooner, but the company is more valuable when\\rit reaches that point than it would be if it were growing slower.That\\'s why founders sometimes get so rich so young now. The low\\rinitial cost of starting a startup means founders can start young,\\rand the fast growth of companies today means that if they succeed\\rthey could be surprisingly rich just a few years later.It\\'s easier now to start and grow a company than it has ever been.\\rThat means more people start them, that those who do get better\\rterms from investors, and that the resulting companies become more\\rvaluable. Once you understand how these mechanisms work, and that\\rstartups were suppressed for most of the 20th century, you don\\'t\\rhave to resort to some vague right turn the country took under\\rReagan to explain why America\\'s Gini coefficient is increasing. Of\\rcourse the Gini coefficient is increasing. With more people starting\\rmore valuable companies, how could it not be?'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'One of the differences between big companies and startups is thatbig companies tend to have developed procedures to protect themselvesagainst mistakes.  A startup walks like a toddler, bashinginto things and falling over all the time.  A big company is moredeliberate.The gradual accumulation of checks in an organization is a kind oflearning, based on disasters that have happened to it or otherslike it.  After giving a contract to a supplier who goes bankruptand fails to deliver, for example, a company might require allsuppliers to prove they\\'re solvent before submitting bids.As companies grow they invariably get more such checks, either inresponse to disasters they\\'ve suffered, or (probably more often)by hiring people from bigger companies who bring with them customsfor protecting against new types of disasters.It\\'s natural for organizations to learn from mistakes.  The problemis, people who propose new checks almost never consider that thecheck itself has a cost.Every check has a cost.For example, consider the case of makingsuppliers verify their solvency.  Surely that\\'s mere prudence?  Butin fact it could have substantial costs.  There\\'s obviously thedirect cost in time of the people on both sides who supply and checkproofs of the supplier\\'s solvency.  But the real costs are the onesyou never hear about: the company that would be the best supplier,but doesn\\'t bid because they can\\'t spare the effort to get verified.Or the company that would be the best supplier, but falls just shortof the threshold for solvency—which will of course have been seton the high side, since there is no apparent cost of increasing it.Whenever someone in an organization proposes to add a new check,they should have to explain not just the benefit but the cost.  Nomatter how bad a job they did of analyzing it, this meta-check wouldat least remind everyone there had tobea cost, and send themlooking for it.If companies started doing that, they\\'d find some surprises.  JoelSpolsky recently spoke at Y Combinator about selling software tocorporate customers.  He said that in most companies software costingup to about $1000 could be bought by individual managers withoutany additional approvals.  Above that threshold, software purchasesgenerally had to be approved by a committee.  But babysitting thisprocess was so expensive for software vendors that it didn\\'t makesense to charge less than $50,000.  Which means if you\\'re makingsomething you might otherwise have charged $5000 for, you have tosell it for $50,000 instead.The purpose of the committee is presumably to ensure that the companydoesn\\'t waste money. And yet the result is that the company pays10 times as much.Checks on purchases will always be expensive, because the harderit is to sell something to you, the more it has to cost.  And notmerely linearly, either.  If you\\'re hard enough to sell to, thepeople who are best at making things don\\'t want to bother.  Theonly people who will sell to you are companies that specialize inselling to you.  Then you\\'ve sunk to a whole new level of inefficiency.Market mechanisms no longer protect you, because the good suppliersare no longer in the market.Such things happen constantly to the biggest organizations of all,governments.  But checks instituted by governments can cause muchworse problems than merely overpaying.  Checks instituted bygovernments can cripple a country\\'s whole economy.  Up till about1400, China was richer and more technologically advanced than Europe.One reason Europe pulled ahead was that the Chinese governmentrestricted long trading voyages.  So it was left to the Europeansto explore and eventually to dominate the rest of the world, includingChina.In more recent times, Sarbanes-Oxley has practically destroyed theUS IPO market.  That wasn\\'t the intention of the legislators whowrote it.  They just wanted to add a few more checks on publiccompanies.  But they forgot to consider the cost.  They forgot thatcompanies about to go public are usually rather stretched, and thatthe weight of a few extra checks that might be easy for GeneralElectric to bear are enough to prevent younger companies from beingpublic at all.Once you start to think about the cost of checks, you can start toask other interesting questions. Is the cost increasing or decreasing?Is it higher in some areas than others?  Where does it increasediscontinuously?  If large organizations started to ask questionslike that, they\\'d learn some frightening things.I think the cost of checks may actually be increasing.  The reasonis that software plays an increasingly important role in companies,and the people who write software are particularly harmed by checks.Programmers are unlike many types of workers in that the best onesactually prefer to work hard.  This doesn\\'t seem to be the case inmost types of work.  When I worked in fast food, we didn\\'t preferthe busy times.  And when I used to mow lawns, I definitely didn\\'tprefer it when the grass was long after a week of rain.Programmers, though, like it better when they write more code.  Ormore precisely, when they release more code.  Programmers like tomake a difference.  Good ones, anyway.For good programmers, one of the best things about working for astartup is that there are few checks on releases.  In true startups,there are no external checks at all.  If you have an idea for a newfeature in the morning, you can write it and push it to the productionservers before lunch.  And when you can do that, you have moreideas.At big companies, software has to go through various approvalsbefore it can be launched.  And the cost of doing this can beenormous—in fact, discontinuous.  I was talking recently to agroup of three programmers whose startup had been acquired a fewyears before by a big company.  When they\\'d been independent, theycould release changes instantly.  Now, they said, the absolutefastest they could get code released on the production servers wastwo weeks.This didn\\'t merely make them less productive.  It made them hateworking for the acquirer.Here\\'s a sign of how much programmers like to be able to work hard:these guys would havepaidto be able to release code immediately,the way they used to.  I asked them if they\\'d trade 10% of theacquisition price for the ability to release code immediately, andall three instantly said yes.  Then I asked what was the maximumpercentage of the acquisition price they\\'d trade for it.  They saidthey didn\\'t want to think about it, because they didn\\'t want toknow how high they\\'d go, but I got the impression it might be asmuch as half.They\\'d have sacrificed hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhapsmillions, just to be able to deliver more software to users.  Andyou know what?  It would have been perfectly safe to let them.  Infact, the acquirer would have been better off; not only wouldn\\'tthese guys have broken anything, they\\'d have gotten a lot more done.So the acquirer is in fact getting worse performance at greatercost.  Just like the committee approving software purchases.And just as the greatest danger of being hard to sell to is notthat you overpay but that the best suppliers won\\'t even sell toyou, the greatest danger of applying too many checks to yourprogrammers is not that you\\'ll make them unproductive, but thatgood programmers won\\'t even want to work for you.Steve Jobs\\'s famous maxim \"artists ship\" works both ways.  Artistsaren\\'t merely capable of shipping.  They insist on it.  So if youdon\\'t let people ship, you won\\'t have any artists.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,were writing and programming. I didn\\'t write essays. I wrote whatbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably stillare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made themdeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that ourschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\\'s1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, andmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was likea mini Bond villain\\'s lair down there, with all these alien-lookingmachines — CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting upon a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had totype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card readerand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. Theresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularlyloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn\\'t figure out what to do withit. And in retrospect there\\'s not much I could have done with it.The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,and I didn\\'t have any data stored on punched cards. The only otheroption was to do things that didn\\'t rely on any input, like calculateapproximations of pi, but I didn\\'t know enough math to do anythinginteresting of that type. So I\\'m not surprised I can\\'t remember anyprograms I wrote, because they can\\'t have done much. My clearestmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs notto terminate, when one of mine didn\\'t. On a machine withouttime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, asthe data center manager\\'s expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have acomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respondto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning througha stack of punch cards and then stopping.The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.It was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressedand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typingprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years ofnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 wasgood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrotesimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets wouldfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least onebook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, sohe\\'d write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was alot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn\\'t plan to study it in college.In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much morepowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the studyof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied inother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered whenI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of thespace of ideas that there wasn\\'t much left for these supposedultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge casesthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn\\'t have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew atthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they keptbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two thingsespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by HeinleincalledThe Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligentcomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed TerryWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven\\'t tried rereadingThe Moon is a HarshMistress, so I don\\'t know how well it has aged, but when I read itI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter oftime before we\\'d have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you hadto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren\\'t any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduateclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learningLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,and programmers\\' ideas correspondingly so. The default language atCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situationwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a programso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of wherethe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I hadexpected college to do. It wasn\\'t happening in a class, like it wassupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on aroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My Goddid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,but what made it even more exciting was my belief — hard to imaginenow, but not unique in 1985 — that it was already climbing thelower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn\\'t make you choosea major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choosewhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"ArtificialIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayedto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read asscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusinglyaccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned forAI at the time, and Harvard, which I\\'d visited because Rich Draveswent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who\\'d invented thetype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,so that was where I went.I don\\'t remember the moment it happened, or if there even was aspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realizedthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean thesort of AI in which a program that\\'s told \"the dog is sitting onthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and addsit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there\\'s a subset ofnatural language that\\'s a formal language. But a very proper subset.It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what theycould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That wholeway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,was not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about variousband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going toget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckageof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lispwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its associationwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared aboutit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decidedto write a book about Lisp hacking. It\\'s scary to think how littleI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. Butthere\\'s nothing like writing a book about something to help youlearn it. The book,On Lisp, wasn\\'t published till 1993, but I wrotemuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theoryand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems peoplebuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect fortheory — indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirableof the two halves — but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn\\'t last.Any program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsoletein a couple decades at best. People might mention your software infootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it wouldseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history ofthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computerlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with couldhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by presentstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, sooff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that wouldlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves atCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit theCarnegie Institute, where I\\'d spent a lot of time as a kid. Whilelooking at a painting there I realized something that might seemobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn\\'tbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Notas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thoughtif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had tobe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you couldbe truly independent. You wouldn\\'t have a boss, or even need to getresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I hadno idea. I\\'d never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectuallythat people made art — that it didn\\'t just appear spontaneously— but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.They either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strangethings in profiles inLifemagazine. The idea of actually beingable to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almostmiraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad studentscould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,was very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes Iwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning tobe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking andworking away atOn Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not mythesis.I didn\\'t see a way out of this situation. I didn\\'t want to drop outof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I rememberwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writingthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he\\'d found such aspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran intoprofessor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduatethat June. I didn\\'t have a word of my dissertation written, but inwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, Idecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so thatremained before the deadline, reusing parts ofOn Lispwhere Icould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,I think so. I\\'ll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospectI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There\\'sa whole world there that\\'s barely been explored. But all I wantedwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertationsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD inthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, becauseit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD acceptedme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to ProvidenceI went.I\\'d applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect thatI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of differentages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to dothe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes thateveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,and design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter fromthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they\\'d sent it toCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting meto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now onlyweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. Ihad some money saved from consulting work I\\'d done in grad school;there was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Nowall I had to do was learn Italian.Onlystranieri(foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. Inretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, becausethere were so manystranieriattracted by the idea of studyingart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have beenoutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from theRISD foundation that summer, but I still don\\'t know how I managedto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essayquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up theintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limitedvocabulary.I\\'m only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution inthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet againabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the paintingdepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby thestudents wouldn\\'t require the faculty to teach anything, and inreturn the faculty wouldn\\'t require the students to learn anything.And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to theconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of thoselittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th centurystudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possiblewithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besidesme. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionallytrying to imitate things they\\'d seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She madea living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for alocal antique dealer. She\\'d copy an obscure old painting out of abook, and then he\\'d take the copy and maltreat it to make it lookold.While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting stilllives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, becausethe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps ofcanvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting stilllives is different from painting people, because the subject, asits name suggests, can\\'t move. People can\\'t sit for more than about15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don\\'t sit very still.So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to painta generic person, which you then modify to match the specific personyou\\'re painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copypixel by pixel from what you\\'re seeing. You don\\'t want to stopthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and whatmakes a still life interesting is that it\\'s been through a head.You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point isthat it\\'s the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such thingsyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs notjust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoreticsense.I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I wasseeing. In everyday life, we aren\\'t consciously aware of much we\\'reseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processesthat merely tell your brain \"that\\'s a water droplet\" without tellingyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\"that\\'s a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of everyleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life itwould be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But whenyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, andwhen you do there\\'s a lot to see. You can still be noticing newthings after days of trying to paint something people usually takefor granted, just as you canafterdays of trying to write an essay about something people usuallytake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I\\'m not 100% sure it\\'s even agood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worthtrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I workedhard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort ofpassport each student had. But the Accademia wasn\\'t teaching meanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at theend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was veryexpensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return toRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, whichmade software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?Exactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eathigh end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they\\'dadded a scripting language, and even made the scripting language adialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things init. This was the closest thing I\\'ve had to a normal job, and Ihereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bademployee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, andsince I didn\\'t know C and didn\\'t want to learn it, I never understoodmost of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This wasback when a programming job meant showing up every day during certainworking hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point therest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but atthe time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year Ispent much of my time surreptitiously working onOn Lisp, which Ihad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especiallyby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of therent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I wasgetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I wasjust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed tosave enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostlyabout what not to do. I learned that it\\'s better for technologycompanies to be run by product people than sales people (thoughsales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really goodat it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,that cheap office space is no bargain if it\\'s depressing, thatplanned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,bureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and thatthere\\'s not much overlap between conventional office hours and theoptimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimalplace for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in bothViaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:that it\\'s good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though thatwill be less prestigious, because if you\\'re not, someone else willbe, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn meansthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to dofreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, andthis was how I survived for the next several years. When I cameback to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a newthing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative ofSGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard atInterleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a bigpart of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia hadbeen a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real artschool was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it wasnow becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationshipto art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not thepainting department. The textile department, which my next doorneighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubtillustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which to themore worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctivesignature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show businessis known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies thework as yours and no one else\\'s. For example, when you see a paintingthat looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it\\'s by RoyLichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging inthe apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millionsof dollars for it. That\\'s not always why artists have a signaturestyle, but it\\'s usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\"in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be thebest art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. Theytended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,but they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was notone of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I wasdefinitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature styleseekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise Iwas basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that forfree. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. Arent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in NewYork was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn\\'t much more thanmy current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artistswere. So yes, I wanted it!Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaulthat turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can dosomething similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on theUpper East Side, there\\'s a tiny corner that\\'s not rich, or at leastwasn\\'t in 1993. It\\'s called Yorkville, and that was my new home.Now I was a New York artist — in the strictly technical sense ofmaking paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf wason the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and Ididn\\'t want to have to program in another language, which in thosedays would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nosefor financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be usedas a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royaltiesand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover ofthis book,ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around thistime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle andJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the earlyphotorealists, and I\\'d taken her painting class at Harvard. I\\'venever known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbersof former students kept in touch with her, including me. After Imoved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters therewas something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn\\'tthat much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenlyoccurred to me: why don\\'t I become rich? Then I\\'ll be able to workon whatever I want.Meanwhile I\\'d been hearing more and more about this new thing calledthe World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visitedhim in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. Itseemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I\\'d seen what graphicaluser interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. Itseemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decidedwe should start a company to put art galleries online. I can\\'thonestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, thatthis was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Artgalleries didn\\'t want to be online, and still don\\'t, not the fancyones. That\\'s not how they sell. I wrote some software to generateweb sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images andset up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign upgalleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sitesfor them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized thatexcept for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we\\'dbeen generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing calledan \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copyofANSI Common Lispto the publishers, we started trying to writesoftware to build online stores. At first this was going to benormal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how towrite Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unixworld. But we decided we\\'d at least try writing a prototype storebuilder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a newsite generator for stores — in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert\\'s apartment in Cambridge. His roommatewas away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in hisroom. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just amattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattressI had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ranthe software on the server, and let users control it by clickingon links? Then we\\'d never have to write anything to run on users\\'computers. We could generate the sites on the same server we\\'d servethem from. Users wouldn\\'t need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but atthe time it wasn\\'t clear that it was even possible. To find out,we decided to try making a version of our store builder that youcould control through the browser. A couple days later, on August12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved youcould build a whole store through the browser, without any clientsoftware or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of awhole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn\\'tneed versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf therehad been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed tobe at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.Now you could just update the software right on the server.We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that oursoftware worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed fundingfrom Idelle\\'s husband Julian. In return for that and doing theinitial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%of the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for YCombinator\\'s. We knew founders needed something like this, becausewe\\'d needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousanddollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced bywhat I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set asidethe proper proportion of the money I\\'d made consulting for Interleaf?No, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend,I needed that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitiousabout the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed tobuild a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creatingpages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would begenerated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,the links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on theserver.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an onlinestore builder is to make users look legit, and the key to lookinglegit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fontsand colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of hisbedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you\\'re curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it\\'s becauseit\\'s still made with this software. It may look clunky today, butin 1996 it was the last word in slick.)In September, Robert rebelled. \"We\\'ve been working on this for amonth,\" he said, \"and it\\'s still not done.\" This is funny inretrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 yearslater. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers,and I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good.He recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, becauseat that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everythingin his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around withhim. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be afrighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They\\'re the twomostindependent-mindedpeople I know, and in completely differentways. If you could see inside Rtm\\'s brain it would look like acolonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor\\'sit would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was justas well we waited a few months, because although we worried we werelate, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot oftalk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actuallywanted online stores.There were three main parts to the software: the editor, whichpeople used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart,which Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders andstatistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was oneof the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tightand didn\\'t have to integrate with any other software except Robert\\'sand Trevor\\'s, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I\\'d had to dowas work on this software, the next 3 years would have been theeasiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all ofit stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years wereinstead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the secondhalf of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, notthe Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. Itwas lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to makeViaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 amonth for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This lowprice was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides ofcompetitors, but it wasn\\'t because of some clever insight that weset the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.$300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example,we did what\\'s now called \"doing things thatdon\\'t scale,\" althoughat the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we\\'redriven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most commonof which was building stores for them. This seemed particularlyhumiliating, since the whole raison d\\'etre of our software was thatpeople could use it to make their own stores. But anything to getusers.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. Forexample, that if you could only have a small image of a man\\'s shirt(and all images were small then by present standards), it was betterto have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.The reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had torescan about 30 images of men\\'s shirts. My first set of scans wereso beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.Building stores for users taught us about retail, and about how itfelt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelledby \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be incharge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted,in much the same way I was converted tofatherhoodonce I had kids.Whatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we\\'d haveso many users that I couldn\\'t scan their images for them, but inthe meantime there was nothing more important to do.Another thing I didn\\'t get at the time is thatgrowth rateis theultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. Imistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute numberof users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense thatthat\\'s how much money you\\'re making, and if you\\'re not making enough,you might go out of business. But in the long term the growth ratetakes care of the absolute number. If we\\'d been a startup I wasadvising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressedout, because you\\'re doing fine. You\\'re growing 7x a year. Just don\\'thire too many more people and you\\'ll soon be profitable, and thenyou\\'ll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wantedme to, and partly because that\\'s what startups did during theInternet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees wouldhave seemed amateurish. So we didn\\'t reach breakeven until aboutwhen Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant wewere at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company.And since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, theresult was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viawebstock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitableand growing rapidly. But it didn\\'t feel very valuable to me; I hadno idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware ofthe near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Norhad I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since westarted. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags toriches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone wereby far the most luxurious thing I owned.The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, musthave been the least productive of my life. I didn\\'t realize it atthe time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of runningViaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continuemy usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatiguecombined with Yahoo\\'s prematurely agedcultureand grim cube farmin Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months itfelt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At thetime I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they\\'d never be worthanything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the nextyear. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in thesummer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I\\'d painted anythingthat I\\'d half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had beenentirely full of software and men\\'s shirts for 4 years. But I haddone this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and nowI was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversationwith me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of picturesI wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such aninterest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.My options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If Iwas leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be togo and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take peoplewith me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo wasground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leavingthen to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely,and yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.There was no time to lose. I\\'d already burned 4 years getting rich.Now when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling theircompanies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That\\'swhat I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothingfor a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn\\'t seem to have any energy orambition. Part of the problem was that I didn\\'t know many peoplein California. I\\'d compounded this problem by buying a house up inthe Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles fromanywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperationI went back to New York, where unless you understand about rentcontrol you\\'ll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealedup like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, andthere were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn\\'tknow any of them.When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I wasrich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns,except now there were doors where there hadn\\'t been. Now when I wastired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unlessit was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walkedpast charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. Itwas exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimentedwith a new kind of still life where I\\'d paint one painting in theold way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, andthen use that as the underpainting for a second still life, paintedfrom the same objects (which hopefully hadn\\'t rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actuallychoose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself andvarious real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided byoccasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized therewasn\\'t one. Huh.Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clearfrom our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Whynot build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people editcode on our server through the browser, and then host the resultingapplications for them?You could run all sorts of serviceson the servers that these applications could use just by making anAPI call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images,taking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn\\'t think about anythingelse. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn\\'t particularlywant to start another company, but it was clear that this idea wouldhave to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge andstart it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, butthere I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, andthough he\\'d made a lot of money the last time I\\'d lured him intoworking on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.So while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmlyrefused to work on it.Hmph. Well, I\\'d do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who hadworked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, andwe got to work trying to build what it\\'s now clear is about twentycompanies and several open source projects worth of software. Thelanguage for defining applications would of course be a dialect ofLisp. But I wasn\\'t so naive as to assume I could spring an overtLisp on a general audience; we\\'d hide the parentheses, like Dylandid.By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an\"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn\\'t last longbefore it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was currentfor long enough that I named this new company after it: it was goingto be called Aspra.I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on networkinfrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first twoservices (images and phone calls). But about halfway through thesummer I realized I really didn\\'t want to run a company — especiallynot a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I\\'donly started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn\\'tneed money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to berealized as a company, then screw the vision. I\\'d build a subsetthat could be done as an open source project.Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was notwasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would oftenencounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, andit was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it andeven trying to write some of it.The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp,whose parentheses I now wouldn\\'t even have to hide. A lot of Lisphackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of thedistinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, andpartly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form ofLisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. Soat the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this newdialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.The following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give atalk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we\\'d used Lispat Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online,on paulgraham.com, which I\\'d created years before using Viaweb buthad never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.What on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someonehad posted it on Slashdot.Wow, I thought, there\\'s an audience. If I write something and putit on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, butit was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channelto readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The onlyway to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it publishedas a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publishanything.This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many peoplehad realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with buildingthe infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writeras well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then ittook me several years to understand the implications. It meant therewould be a whole new generation ofessays.In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had beenvanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkerswho went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowedto publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties.There were so many essays that had never been written, because therehad been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was goingto write them.I\\'ve worked on several different things, but to the extent therewas a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it waswhen I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew thatwhatever else I did, I\\'d always write essays too.I knew that online essays would be amarginalmedium at first.Socially they\\'d seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on theirGeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositionspublished inThe New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough tofind that encouraging instead of discouraging.One of the most conspicuous patterns I\\'ve noticed in my life is howwell it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren\\'tprestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious formof painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we startedthem. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask whatI\\'m writing, and I explain that it\\'s an essay I\\'m going to publishon my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually insomething like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.It\\'s not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But whenyou find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its currentlack of prestige, it\\'s a sign both that there\\'s something real tobe discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives.Impure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything isgoing to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people.So while working on things that aren\\'t prestigious doesn\\'t guaranteeyou\\'re on the right track, it at least guarantees you\\'re not on themost common type of wrong one.Over the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kindsof different topics. O\\'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as abook, calledHackers & Paintersafter one of the essays in it. Ialso worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used tohave dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, whichtaught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building inCambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, pornstudio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It wasa clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursdaydiners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to oneparty. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would bepeople they didn\\'t know but would probably like. One of the guestswas someone I didn\\'t know but would turn out to like a lot: a womancalled Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank.This bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year,as she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprisedhow different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. Soshe decided to compile a book ofinterviewswith startup founders.When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half herstaff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewedfor a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to makeup their minds, and during this time I started telling her aboutall the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. Theyshould make a larger number of smaller investments instead of ahandful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technicalfounders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain asCEO, and so on.One of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks.The prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of peopleand tell them something that won\\'t waste their time is a greatspur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, theundergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I wouldtell them how to start a startup. Maybe they\\'d be able to avoid theworst of the mistakes we\\'d made.So I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that thebest sources of seed funding were successful startup founders,because then they\\'d be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemedthey were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospectof having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I\\'d only known),I blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the talk. But afterwardit occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating aboutangel investing. I\\'d been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and nowit was 7 years later and I still hadn\\'t done one angel investment.Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projectswe could work on together. I missed working with them, and it seemedlike there had to be something we could collaborate on.As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at thecorner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged.Screw the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We\\'dstart our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we\\'dbeen talking about. I\\'d fund it, and Jessica could quit her job andwork for it, and we\\'d get Robert and Trevor as partners too.Once again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how tobe angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conwaysto learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices,and some of the things we did turned out to be novel.There are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn\\'t figurethem all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm.In those days, those two words didn\\'t go together. There were VCfirms, which were organized companies with people whose job it wasto make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments.And there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these wereindividuals who were usually focused on other things and madeinvestments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enoughin the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects,because we remembered how helpless we\\'d been. For example, one thingJulian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get usset up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software,but actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and allthat stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only tomake seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian haddone for us.YC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that wefunded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers,but professional investors are thinking \"Wow, that means they gotall the returns.\" But once again, this was not due to any particularinsight on our part. We didn\\'t know how VC firms were organized.It never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, wewouldn\\'t have known where to start.The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund abunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend threemonths focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part wediscovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly dueto our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience asinvestors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunchof startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at techcompanies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program wherethey\\'d start startups instead? We wouldn\\'t feel guilty for beingin a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sensebe fake founders. So while we probably wouldn\\'t make much money outof it, we\\'d at least get to practice being investors on them, andthey for their part would probably have a more interesting summerthan they would working at Microsoft.We\\'d use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters.We\\'d all have dinner there once a week — on tuesdays, since I wasalready cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays — and afterdinner we\\'d bring in experts on startups to give talks.We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in amatter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer FoundersProgram, and I posted anannouncementon my site, inviting undergradsto apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a wayto get \"deal flow,\" as investors call it, but it turned out to bethe perfect source.We got 225 applications for the SummerFounders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of themwere from people who\\'d already graduated, or were about to thatspring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more seriousthan we\\'d intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, andfrom those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. Thatfirst batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who wenton to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write theRSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access,and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC.I don\\'t think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good.You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like theSummer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit placelike Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we didwith Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad studentsgot for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in thetypical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had tobe fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves hadtaken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica broughtthe founders free air conditioners.Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scalestartup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenientfor us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startupsat once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too.It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: theisolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues whounderstood the problems you were facing and could tell you how theywere solving them.As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. Thealumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another,and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered beingin. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another\\'scustomers. We used to refer jokingly to the \"YC GDP,\" but as YCgrows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startupsget their initial set of customers almost entirely from among theirbatchmates.I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was goingto do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew,and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot morethan a third of my attention. But for the first few years I wasstill able to work on other things.In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new versionof Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled intoScheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It wasoriginally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders andwas called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired ofreading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn\\'t startup founderswe wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changedthe name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one\\'sintellectual curiosity.HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggestsource of stress for me. If all I\\'d had to do was select and helpfounders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HNwas a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one\\'s workshould at least be something close to the core of the work. WhereasI was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon notfrom the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from anill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem duringYC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40%chance it had do with everything else combined.As well as HN, I wrote all of YC\\'s internal software in Arc. Butwhile I continued to work a good dealinArc, I gradually stoppedworkingonArc, partly because I didn\\'t have time to, and partlybecause it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the languagenow that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now mythree projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working onYC.YC was different from other kinds of work I\\'ve done. Instead ofdeciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems,whatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work,because their problems were quite varied, and the good founderswere very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you couldabout startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn\\'t havepicked a better way to do it.There were parts of the job I didn\\'t like. Disputes between cofounders,figuring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people whomaltreated the startups, and so on. But I worked hard even at theparts I didn\\'t like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale oncesaid about companies: \"No one works harder than the boss.\" He meantit both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the secondpart that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I workedset the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I\\'d betterwork very hard.One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews,Robert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicitedadvice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day atViaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggestedthat it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital.That was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. So Iremember his exact words very clearly. \"You know,\" he said, \"youshould make sure Y Combinator isn\\'t the last cool thing you do.\"At the time I didn\\'t understand what he meant, but gradually itdawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strangeadvice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarerthan Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set methinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would bethe last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of myattention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process ofeating essays too. Either YC was my life\\'s work or I\\'d have to leaveeventually. And it wasn\\'t, so I would.In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turnedout to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyedher balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she reallywanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and Iwere determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon tovisit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on thoseflights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over tosomeone else.I asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn\\'t, sowe decided we\\'d try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert andTrevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard.Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC wefour had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and todo that it couldn\\'t be controlled by the founders. So if Sam saidyes, we\\'d let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, andJessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially hesaid no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors.But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decidedhe\\'d take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the restof 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he couldlearn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whosecancer had returned.She died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it wasstill hard when it did.I kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startupsthrough Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I stilltalk to alumni and to new startups working on things I\\'m interestedin, but that only takes a few hours a week.)What should I do next? Rtm\\'s advice hadn\\'t included anything aboutthat. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decidedI\\'d paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focusedon it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting.I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it wasat least completely engaging.I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I\\'d never been able towork so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I hadbeen. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in themiddle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I\\'dalways been curious to see how the painting I was working on wouldturn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. SoI stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven\\'t paintedsince. So far anyway.I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sumgame. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a projectthat\\'s not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it\\'sgetting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there wassome opportunity cost to screwing around.I started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones overthe next few months. I even wrote a couple thatweren\\'taboutstartups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a languagedefined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn\\'t originallyintended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It wasmeant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to theTuring machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a languagein itself, what\\'s the minimum set of predefined operators you need?The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered,is an answer to that question.McCarthy didn\\'t realize this Lisp could even be used to programcomputers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russelltranslated McCarthy\\'s interpreter into IBM 704 machine language,and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming languagein the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computationgave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn\\'t match.It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn\\'t understandwhy at the time.McCarthy\\'s 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions.It was missing a lot of things you\\'d want in a programming language.So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren\\'t definedusing McCarthy\\'s original axiomatic approach. That wouldn\\'t havebeen feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter byhand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already gettingclose to the limit of interpreters you could test that way — indeed,there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a morecomplicated interpreter, you\\'d have had to run it, and computersthen weren\\'t powerful enough.Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy\\'saxiomatic approach till you\\'d defined a complete programming language.And as long as every change you made to McCarthy\\'s Lisp was adiscoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle,end up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder todo than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle,why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years,from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that Ihad a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keepat it for so long.I wrote this new Lisp, calledBel, in itself in Arc. That may soundlike a contradiction, but it\\'s an indication of the sort of trickeryI had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregiouscollection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to aninterpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast,but fast enough to test.I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time,or I\\'d never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writingessays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barelyunderstand the code. Not so much because it was badly written asbecause the problem is so convoluted. When you\\'re working on aninterpreter written in itself, it\\'s hard to keep track of what\\'shappening at what level, and errors can be practically encryptedby the time you get them.So I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few peopleabout Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must haveseemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harderthan I\\'d ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling forhours with some gruesome bug I\\'d check Twitter or HN and see someoneasking \"Does Paul Graham still code?\"Working on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensivelythat at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my headand could write more there. I remember taking the boys to thecoast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with someproblem involving continuations while I watched them play in thetide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember thatbecause I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good newsis that I had more moments like this over the next few years.In the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids tosee what it was like living in another country, and since I was aBritish citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We onlymeant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we stilllive there. So most of Bel was written in England.In the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy\\'soriginal Lisp, it\\'s a spec rather than an implementation, althoughlike McCarthy\\'s Lisp it\\'s a spec expressed as code.Now that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topicsI\\'d had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I alsostarted to think about other things I could work on. How should Ichoose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in thepast? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and Iwas surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. Ifthis surprised me, who\\'d lived it, then I thought perhaps it wouldbe interesting to other people, and encouraging to those withsimilarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for othersto read, and this is the last sentence of it.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': \"If you have a US startup called X and you don't have x.com, youshould probably change your name.The reason is not just that people can't find you.  For companieswith mobile apps, especially, having the right domain name is notas critical as it used to be for getting users.  The problem withnot having the .com of your name is that it signals weakness.  Unlessyou're so big that your reputation precedes you, a marginal domainsuggests you're a marginal company.  Whereas(asStripeshows)having x.com signals strength even if it has no relation to what youdo.Even good founders can be in denial about this.  Their denial derivesfrom two very powerful forces: identity, and lack of imagination.X is what weare, founders think. There's no other name as good.Both of which are false.You can fix the first by stepping back from the problem. Imagineyou'd called your company something else.  If you had, surely you'dbe just as attached to that name as you are to your current one.The idea of switching to your current name would seem repellent.There's nothing intrinsically great about your current name.  Nearlyall your attachment to it comes from it being attached to you.The way to neutralize the second source of denial, your inabilityto think of other potential names, is to acknowledge that you'rebad at naming.  Naming is a completely separate skill from thoseyou need to be a good founder.  You can be a great startup founderbut hopeless at thinking of names for your company.Once you acknowledge that, you stop believing there is nothing elseyou could be called.  There are lots of other potential names thatare as good or better; you just can't think of them.How do you find them? One answer is the default way to solveproblems you're bad at: find someone else who can think of names.But with company names there is another possibleapproach.  It turns out almost any word or word pair that is notan obviously bad name is a sufficiently good one, and the numberof such domains is so large that you can find plenty that are cheapor even untaken.  So make a list and try to buy some.  That's whatStripedid.  (Their search also turned up parse.com, which theirfriends at Parse took.)The reason I know that naming companies is a distinct skill orthogonalto the others you need in a startup is that I happen to have it.Back when I was running YC and did more office hours with startups,I would often help them find new names.  80% of the time we couldfind at least one good name in a 20 minute office hour slot.Now when I do office hours I have to focus on more importantquestions, like what the company is doing.  I tell them when theyneed to change their name.  But I know the power of the forces thathave them in their grip, so I know most won't listen.There are of course examples of startups that have succeeded withouthaving the .com of their name.  There are startups that have succeeded despite anynumber of different mistakes.  But this mistake is less excusablethan most.  It's something that can be fixed in a couple days ifyou have sufficient discipline to acknowledge the problem.100% of the top 20 YC companies by valuation have the .com of theirname. 94% of the top 50 do. But only 66% of companies in the currentbatch have the .com of their name. Which suggests there are lessonsahead for most of the rest, one way or another.\"},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998I took asnapshot of Viaweb\\'ssite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screenswere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpageused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fontsand they weren\\'t antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages thatlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb andY Combinatorlogos.  We did thatas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a redcircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb howfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realizedwhy.On theCompanypageyou\\'ll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.Robert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after theWormthat hedidn\\'t want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agreeto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He hassincerelaxeda biton that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in thecourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionairePhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releaseswas onecelebratinghis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him duringa meeting.(Trevor also appears asTrevinoBagwellin our directory of web designers merchants could hireto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case somecompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logowould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazinesand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found onlinethat there are today.  So we used to pay aPRfirm$16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunatelyreporterslikedus.In ouradvice aboutgetting traffic from search engines(I don\\'t think the term SEOhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,AltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Noticeanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company calledCybercash,since if we lacked that feature we\\'d have gotten beaten up in productcomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores\\' order volumeswere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying totalk merchantsout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to thetest drive.It was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We putcgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how oursoftware worked.We had somewellknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick\\'s of Hollywood got themost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,so it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.I once calculated how much Frederick\\'s was costing us in bandwidth,and it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting justover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed whatat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)coming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Evencolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often thingswent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Ormore precisely, in Trevor\\'s office.  In return for the uniqueprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had toshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamedthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days hisstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language calledRTML, whichsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named afterRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,and concealed under a structure editor that made it look like ithad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn\\'t actually haveversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, sowe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we madethe version numberaninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our ownbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was madewith our software, even though it wasn\\'t an online store, becausewe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping searchengine calledShopfind.  Itwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawlerthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick outthe products.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'The Best Essay',\n",
       "  'date': 'March 2024',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'Despite its title this isn\\'t meant to be the best essay. My goalhere is to figure out what the best essay would be like.It would be well-written, but you can write well about any topic.What made it special would be what it was about.Obviously some topics would be better than others. It probablywouldn\\'t be about this year\\'s lipstick colors. But it wouldn\\'t bevaporous talk about elevated themes either. A good essay has to besurprising. It has to tell people something they don\\'t already know.The best essay would be on the most important topic you could tellpeople something surprising about.That may sound obvious, but it has some unexpected consequences.One is that science enters the picture like an elephant steppinginto a rowboat. For example, Darwin first described the idea ofnatural selection in an essay written in 1844.Talk about animportant topic you could tell people something surprising about.If that\\'s the test of a great essay, this was surely the best onewritten in 1844. And indeed, the best possible essay at any giventime would usually be one describing the most important scientificor technological discovery it was possible to make.Another unexpected consequence: I imagined when I started writingthis that the best essay would be fairly timeless — that the bestessay you could write in 1844 would be much the same as the bestone you could write now. But in fact the opposite seems to be true.It might be true that the best painting would be timeless in thissense. But it wouldn\\'t be impressive to write an essay introducingnatural selection now. The best essaynowwould be one describinga great discovery we didn\\'t yet know about.If the question of how to write the best possible essay reduces tothe question of how to make great discoveries, then I started withthe wrong question. Perhaps what this exercise shows is that weshouldn\\'t waste our time writing essays but instead focus on makingdiscoveries in some specific domain. But I\\'m interested in essaysand what can be done with them, so I want to see if there\\'s someother question I could have asked.There is, and on the face of it, it seems almost identical to theone I started with. Instead of askingwhat would the best essaybe?I should have askedhow do you write essays well?Thoughthese seem only phrasing apart, their answers diverge. The answerto the first question, as we\\'ve seen, isn\\'t really about essaywriting. The second question forces it to be.Writing essays, at its best, is a way of discovering ideas. How doyou do that well? How do you discover by writing?An essay should ordinarily start with what I\\'m going to call aquestion, though I mean this in a very general sense: it doesn\\'thave to be a question grammatically, just something that acts likeone in the sense that it spurs some response.How do you get this initial question? It probably won\\'t work tochoose some important-sounding topic at random and go at it.Professional traders won\\'t even trade unless they have what theycall anedge— a convincing story about why in some class oftrades they\\'ll win more than they lose. Similarly, you shouldn\\'tattack a topic unless you have a way in — some new insight aboutit or way of approaching it.You don\\'t need to have a complete thesis; you just need some kindof gap you can explore. In fact, merely having questions aboutsomething other people take for granted can be edge enough.If you come across a question that\\'s sufficiently puzzling, it couldbe worth exploring even if it doesn\\'t seem very momentous. Many animportant discovery has been made by pulling on a thread that seemedinsignificant at first. How can theyallbe finches?Once you\\'ve got a question, then what? You start thinking out loudabout it. Not literally out loud, but you commit to a specificstring of words in response, as you would if you were talking. Thisinitial response is usually mistaken or incomplete. Writing convertsyour ideas from vague to bad. But that\\'s a step forward, becauseonce you can see the brokenness, you can fix it.Perhaps beginning writers are alarmed at the thought of startingwith something mistaken or incomplete, but you shouldn\\'t be, becausethis is why essay writing works. Forcing yourself to commit to somespecific string of words gives you a starting point, and if it\\'swrong, you\\'ll see that when you reread it. At least half of essaywriting is rereading what you\\'ve written and askingis this correctand complete?You have to be very strict when rereading, not justbecause you want to keep yourself honest, but because a gap betweenyour response and the truth is often a sign of new ideas to bediscovered.The prize for being strict with what you\\'ve written is not justrefinement. When you take a roughly correct answer and try to makeit exactly right, sometimes you find that you can\\'t, and that thereason is that you were depending on a false assumption. And whenyou discard it, the answer turns out to be completely different.Ideally the response to a question is two things: the first stepin a process that converges on the truth, and a source of additionalquestions (in my very general sense of the word). So the processcontinues recursively, as response spurs response.Usually there are several possible responses to a question, whichmeans you\\'re traversing a tree. But essays are linear, not tree-shaped,which means you have to choose one branch to follow at each point.How do you choose? Usually you should follow whichever offers thegreatest combination of generality and novelty. I don\\'t consciouslyrank branches this way; I just follow whichever seems most exciting;but generality and novelty are what make a branch exciting.If you\\'re willing to do a lot of rewriting, you don\\'t have to guessright. You can follow a branch and see how it turns out, and if itisn\\'t good enough, cut it and backtrack. I do this all the time.In this essay I\\'ve already cut a 17-paragraph subtree, in additionto countless shorter ones. Maybe I\\'ll reattach it at the end, orboil it down to a footnote, or spin it off as its own essay; we\\'llsee.In general you want to be quick to cut. One of the most dangeroustemptations in writing (and in software and painting) is to keepsomething that isn\\'t right, just because it contains a few good bitsor cost you a lot of effort.The most surprising new question being thrown off at this point isdoes it really matter what the initial question is?If the spaceof ideas is highly connected, it shouldn\\'t, because you should beable to get from any question to the most valuable ones in a fewhops. And we see evidence that it\\'s highly connected in the way,for example, that people who are obsessed with some topic can turnany conversation toward it. But that only works if you know whereyou want to go, and you don\\'t in an essay. That\\'s the whole point.You don\\'t want to be the obsessive conversationalist, or all youressays will be about the same thing.The other reason the initial question matters is that you usuallyfeel somewhat obliged to stick to it. I don\\'t think about this whenI decide which branch to follow. I just follow novelty and generality.Sticking to the question is enforced later, when I notice I\\'vewandered too far and have to backtrack. But I think this isthe optimal solution. You don\\'t want the hunt for novelty andgenerality to be constrained in the moment. Go with it and see whatyou get.Since the initial question does constrain you, in the best case itsets an upper bound on the quality of essay you\\'ll write. If youdo as well as you possibly can on the chain of thoughts that followfrom the initial question, the initial question itself is the onlyplace where there\\'s room for variation.It would be a mistake to let this make you too conservative though,because you can\\'t predict where a question will lead. Not if you\\'redoing things right, because doing things right means makingdiscoveries, and by definition you can\\'t predict those. So the wayto respond to this situation is not to be cautious about whichinitial question you choose, but to write a lot of essays. Essaysare for taking risks.Almost any question can get you a good essay. Indeed, it took someeffort to think of a sufficiently unpromising topic in the thirdparagraph, because any essayist\\'s first impulse on hearing that thebest essay couldn\\'t be about x would be to try to write it. But ifmost questions yield good essays, only some yield great ones.Can we predict which questions will yield great essays? Consideringhow long I\\'ve been writing essays, it\\'s alarming how novel thatquestion feels.One thing I like in an initial question is outrageousness. I lovequestions that seem naughty in some way — for example, by seemingcounterintuitive or overambitious or heterodox. Ideally all three.This essay is an example. Writing about the best essay implies thereis such a thing, which pseudo-intellectuals will dismiss as reductive,though it follows necessarily from the possibility of one essaybeing better than another. And thinking about how to do somethingso ambitious is close enough to doing it that it holds your attention.I like to start an essay with a gleam in my eye. This could be justa taste of mine, but there\\'s one aspect of it that probably isn\\'t:to write a really good essay on some topic, you have to be interestedin it. A good writer can write well about anything, but to stretchfor the novel insights that are the raison d\\'etre of the essay, youhave to care.If caring about it is one of the criteria for a good initial question,then the optimal question varies from person to person. It alsomeans you\\'re more likely to write great essays if you care about alot of different things. The more curious you are, the greater theprobable overlap between the set of things you\\'re curious about andthe set of topics that yield great essays.What other qualities would a great initial question have? It\\'sprobably good if it has implications in a lot of different areas.And I find it\\'s a good sign if it\\'s one that people think has alreadybeen thoroughly explored. But the truth is that I\\'ve barely thoughtabout how to choose initial questions, because I rarely do it. Irarelychoosewhat to write about; I just start thinking aboutsomething, and sometimes it turns into an essay.Am I going to stop writing essays about whatever I happen to bethinking about and instead start working my way through somesystematically generated list of topics? That doesn\\'t sound likemuch fun. And yet I want to write good essays, and if the initialquestion matters, I should care about it.Perhaps the answer is to go one step earlier: to write about whateverpops into your head, but try to ensure that what pops into yourhead is good. Indeed, now that I think about it, this has to be theanswer, because a mere list of topics wouldn\\'t be any use if youdidn\\'t have edge with any of them. To start writing an essay, youneed a topic plus some initial insight about it, and you can\\'tgenerate those systematically. If only.You can probably cause yourself to have more of them, though. Thequality of the ideas that come out of your head depends on what goesin, and you can improve that in two dimensions, breadth and depth.You can\\'t learn everything, so getting breadth implies learningabout topics that are very different from one another. When I tellpeople about my book-buying trips to Hay and they ask what I buybooks about, I usually feel a bit sheepish answering, because thetopics seem like a laundry list of unrelated subjects. But perhapsthat\\'s actually optimal in this business.You can also get ideas by talking to people, by doing and buildingthings, and by going places and seeing things. I don\\'t think it\\'simportant to talk to new people so much as the sort of people whomake you have new ideas. I get more new ideas after talking for anafternoon with Robert Morris than from talking to 20 new smartpeople. I know because that\\'s what a block of office hours at YCombinator consists of.While breadth comes from reading and talking and seeing, depth comesfrom doing. The way to really learn about some domain is to haveto solve problems in it. Though this could take the form of writing,I suspect that to be a good essayist you also have to do, or havedone, some other kind of work. That may not be true for most otherfields, but essay writing is different. You could spend half yourtime working on something else and be net ahead, so long as it washard.I\\'m not proposing that as a recipe so much as an encouragement tothose already doing it. If you\\'ve spent all your life so far workingon other things, you\\'re already halfway there. Though of course tobe good at writing you have to like it, and if you like writingyou\\'d probably have spent at least some time doing it.Everything I\\'ve said about initial questions applies also to thequestions you encounter in writing the essay. They\\'re the samething; every subtree of an essay is usually a shorter essay, justas every subtree of a Calder mobile is a smaller mobile. So anytechnique that gets you good initial questions also gets you goodwhole essays.At some point the cycle of question and response reaches what feelslike a natural end. Which is a little suspicious; shouldn\\'t everyanswer suggest more questions? I think what happens is that youstart to feel sated. Once you\\'ve covered enough interesting ground,you start to lose your appetite for new questions. Which is justas well, because the reader is probably feeling sated too. And it\\'snot lazy to stop asking questions, because you could instead beasking the initial question of a new essay.That\\'s the ultimate source of drag on the connectedness of ideas:the discoveries you make along the way. If you discover enoughstarting from question A, you\\'ll never make it to question B. Thoughif you keep writing essays you\\'ll gradually fix this problem byburning off such discoveries. So bizarrely enough, writing lots ofessays makes it as if the space of ideas were more highly connected.When a subtree comes to an end, you can do one of two things. Youcan either stop, or pull the Cubist trick of laying separate subtreesend to end by returning to a question you skipped earlier. Usuallyit requires some sleight of hand to make the essay flow continuouslyat this point, but not this time. This time I actually need anexample of the phenomenon. For example, we discovered earlier thatthe best possible essay wouldn\\'t usually be timeless in the way thebest painting would. This seems surprising enough to beworth investigating further.There are two senses in which an essay can be timeless: to be abouta matter of permanent importance, and always to have the same effecton readers. With art these two senses blend together. Art thatlooked beautiful to the ancient Greeks still looks beautiful to us.But with essays the two senses diverge, because essaysteach, and you can\\'t teach people something they already know.Natural selection is certainly a matter of permanent importance,but an essay explaining it couldn\\'t have the same effect on us thatit would have had on Darwin\\'s contemporaries, precisely because hisideas were so successful that everyone already knows about them.I imagined when I started writing this that the best possible essaywould be timeless in the stricter, evergreen sense: that it wouldcontain some deep, timeless wisdom that would appeal equally toAristotle and Feynman. That doesn\\'t seem to be true. But if thebest possible essay wouldn\\'t usually be timeless in this strictersense, what would it take to write essays that were?The answer to that turns out to be very strange: to be the evergreenkind of timeless, an essay has to be ineffective, in the sense thatits discoveries aren\\'t assimilated into our shared culture. Otherwisethere will be nothing new in it for the second generation of readers.If you want to surprise readers not just now but in the future aswell, you have to write essays that won\\'t stick — essays that,no matter how good they are, won\\'t become part of what people inthe future learn before they read them.I can imagine several ways to do that. One would be to write aboutthings people never learn. For example, it\\'s a long-establishedpattern for ambitious people to chase after various types of prizes,and only later, perhaps too late, to realize that some of themweren\\'t worth as much as they thought. If you write about that, youcan be confident of a conveyor belt of future readers to be surprisedby it.Ditto if you write about the tendency of the inexperienced to overdothings — of young engineers to produce overcomplicated solutions,for example. There are some kinds of mistakes people never learnto avoid except by making them. Any of those should be a timelesstopic.Sometimes when we\\'re slow to grasp things it\\'s not just becausewe\\'re obtuse or in denial but because we\\'ve been deliberately liedto. There are a lot of things adultslieto kids about, and whenyou reach adulthood, they don\\'t take you aside and hand you a listof them. They don\\'t remember which lies they told you, and mostwere implicit anyway. So contradicting such lies will be a sourceof surprises for as long as adults keep telling them.Sometimes it\\'s systems that lie to you. For example, the educationalsystems in most countries train you to win byhacking the test. Butthat\\'s not how you win at the most important real-world tests, andafter decades of training, this is hard for new arrivals in the realworld to grasp. Helping them overcome such institutional lies willwork as long as the institutions remain broken.Another recipe for timelessness is to write about things readersalready know, but in much more detail than can be transmittedculturally. \"Everyone knows,\" for example, that it can be rewardingto havekids. But till you have them you don\\'t know precisely whatforms that takes, and even then much of what you know you may neverhave put into words.I\\'ve written about all these kinds of topics. But I didn\\'t do itin a deliberate attempt to write essays that were timeless in thestricter sense. And indeed, the fact that this depends on one\\'s ideasnot sticking suggests that it\\'s not worth making a deliberate attemptto. You should write about topics of timeless importance, yes, butif you do such a good job that your conclusions stick and futuregenerations find your essay obvious instead of novel, so much thebetter. You\\'ve crossed into Darwin territory.Writing about topics of timeless importance is an instance ofsomething even more general, though: breadth of applicability. Andthere are more kinds of breadth than chronological — applying tolots of different fields, for example. So breadth is the ultimateaim.I already aim for it. Breadth and novelty are the two things I\\'malways chasing. But I\\'m glad I understand where timelessness fits.I understand better where a lot of things fit now. This essay hasbeen a kind of tour of essay writing. I started out hoping to getadvice about topics; if you assume good writing, the only thingleft to differentiate the best essay is its topic. And I did getadvice about topics: discover natural selection. Yeah, that wouldbe nice. But when you step back and ask what\\'s the best you can doshort of making some great discovery like that, the answer turnsout to be about procedure. Ultimately the quality of an essay is afunction of the ideas discovered in it, and the way you get themis by casting a wide net for questions and then being very exactingwith the answers.The most striking feature of this map of essay writing are thealternating stripes of inspiration and effort required. The questionsdepend on inspiration, but the answers can be got by sheer persistence.You don\\'t have to get an answer right the first time, but there\\'sno excuse for not getting it right eventually, because you can keeprewriting till you do. And this is not just a theoretical possibility.It\\'s a pretty accurate description of the way I work. I\\'m rewritingas we speak.But although I wish I could say that writing great essays depends mostlyon effort, in the limit case it\\'s inspiration that makes thedifference. In the limit case, the questions are the harder thingto get. That pool has no bottom.How to get more questions? That is the most important question ofall.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Occam\\'s razor says we should prefer the simpler of two explanations.I begin by reminding readers of this principle because I\\'m aboutto propose a theory that will offend both liberals and conservatives.But Occam\\'s razor means, in effect, that if you want to disagreewith it, you have a hell of a coincidence to explain.Theory: In US presidential elections, the more charismatic candidate wins.People who write about politics, whether on the left or the right,have a consistent bias: they take politics seriously.  When onecandidate beats another they look for political explanations.  Thecountry is shifting to the left, or the right.  And that sort ofshift can certainly be the result of a presidential election, whichmakes it easy to believe it was the cause.But when I think about why I voted for Clinton over the first GeorgeBush, it wasn\\'t because I was shifting to the left.  Clinton justseemed more dynamic.  He seemed to want the job more.  Bush seemedold and tired.  I suspect it was the same for a lot of voters.Clinton didn\\'t represent any national shift leftward.He wasjust more charismatic than George Bush or (God help us) Bob Dole.In 2000 we practically got a controlled experiment to prove it:Gore had Clinton\\'s policies, but not his charisma, and he sufferedproportionally.Same story in 2004. Kerry was smarter and morearticulate than Bush, but rather a stiff.  And Kerry lost.As I looked further back, I kept finding the same pattern.  Pundits said Carter beat Fordbecause the country distrusted the Republicans after Watergate.And yet it also happened that Carter was famous for his big grinand folksy ways, and Ford for being a boring klutz.  Four yearslater, pundits said the country had lurched to the right.  ButReagan, a former actor, also happened to be even more charismaticthan Carter (whose grin was somewhat less cheery after four stressfulyears in office).  In 1984 the charisma gap between Reagan andMondale was like that between Clinton and Dole, with similar results.The first George Bush managed to win in 1988, though he would laterbe vanquished by one of the most charismatic presidents ever, becausein 1988 he was up against the notoriously uncharismaticMichael Dukakis.These are the elections I remember personally, but apparently thesame pattern played out in 1964 and 1972.  The most recentcounterexample appears to be 1968, when Nixon beat the more charismatic HubertHumphrey.  But when you examine that election, it tends to supportthe charisma theory more than contradict it.  As Joe McGinnisrecounts in his famous bookThe Selling of the President 1968,Nixon knew he had less charisma than Humphrey, and thus simplyrefused to debate him on TV.  He knew he couldn\\'t afford to let thetwo of them be seen side by side.Now a candidate probably couldn\\'t get away with refusing to debate.But in 1968 the custom of televised debates was still evolving.  Ineffect, Nixon won in 1968 because voters were never allowed to seethe real Nixon.  All they saw were carefully scripted campaignspots.Oddly enough, the most recent true counterexample is probably 1960.Though this election is usually given as an example of the powerof TV, Kennedy apparently would not have won without fraud by partymachines in Illinois and Texas.  But TV was still young in 1960;only 87% of households had it.Undoubtedly TV helped Kennedy,so historians are correct in regarding this election as awatershed.  TV required a new kind of candidate. There would be nomore Calvin Coolidges.The charisma theory may also explain why Democrats tend to losepresidential elections.  The core of the Democrats\\' ideology seemsto be a belief in government.  Perhaps this tends to attract peoplewho are earnest, but dull.  Dukakis, Gore, and Kerry were so similarin that respect that they might have been brothers.  Good thing forthe Democrats that their screen lets through an occasional Clinton,even if some scandal results.One would like to believe elections are won and lost on issues, ifonly fake ones like Willie Horton.  And yet, if they are, we havea remarkable coincidence to explain.  In every presidential electionsince TV became widespread, the apparently more charismatic candidatehas won.  Surprising, isn\\'t it, that voters\\' opinions on the issueshave lined up with charisma for 11 elections in a row?The political commentators who come up with shifts to the left orright in their morning-after analyses are like the financial reportersstuck writing stories day after day about the random fluctuationsof the stock market.  Day ends, market closes up or down, reporterlooks for good or bad news respectively, and writes that the marketwas up on news of Intel\\'s earnings, or down on fears of instabilityin the Middle East.  Suppose we could somehow feed these reportersfalse information about market closes, but give them all the othernews intact.  Does anyone believe they would notice the anomaly,and not simply write that stocks were up (or down) on whatever good(or bad) news there was that day?  That they would say, hey, waita minute, how can stocks be up with all this unrest in the MiddleEast?I\\'m not saying that issues don\\'t matter to voters.  Of course theydo.  But the major parties know so well which issues matter howmuch to how many voters, and adjust their message so precisely inresponse, that they tend to split the difference on the issues,leaving the election to be decided by the one factor they can\\'tcontrol: charisma.If the Democrats had been running a candidate as charismatic asClinton in the 2004 election, he\\'d have won.  And we\\'d be readingthat the election was a referendum on the war in Iraq, instead ofthat the Democrats are out of touch with evangelical Christians inmiddle America.During the 1992 election, the Clinton campaign staff had a big signin their office saying \"It\\'s the economy, stupid.\" Perhaps it waseven simpler than they thought.PostscriptOpinions seem to be divided about the charisma theory.  Some sayit\\'s impossible, others say it\\'s obvious.  This seems a good sign.Perhaps it\\'s in the sweet spot midway between.As for it being impossible, I reply: here\\'s the data; here\\'s thetheory; theory explains data 100%.   To a scientist, at least, thatmeans it deserves attention, however implausible it seems.You can\\'t believe voters are so superficial that they just choosethe most charismatic guy?  My theory doesn\\'t require that.  I\\'m notproposing that charisma is the only factor, just that it\\'s the onlyoneleftafter the efforts of the two parties cancel oneanother out.As for the theory being obvious, as far as I know, no one hasproposed it before.  Election forecasters are proud when they canachieve the same results with much more complicated models.Finally, to the people who say that the theory is probably true,but rather depressing: it\\'s not so bad as it seems.  The phenomenonis like a pricing anomaly; once people realize it\\'s there, it willdisappear.  Once both parties realize it\\'s a waste of time tonominate uncharismatic candidates, they\\'ll tend to nominate onlythe most charismatic ones.  And if the candidates are equallycharismatic, charisma will cancel out, and elections will be decidedon issues, as political commentators like to think they are now.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.September 2012I\\'ve done several types of work over the years but I don\\'t knowanother as counterintuitive as startup investing.The two most important things to understand about startup investing,as a business, are (1) that effectively all the returns areconcentrated in a few big winners, and (2) that the best ideas lookinitially like bad ideas.The first rule I knew intellectually, but didn\\'t really grasp tillit happened to us.  The total value of the companies we\\'ve fundedis around 10 billion, give or take a few.  But just two companies,Dropbox and Airbnb, account for about three quarters of it.In startups, the big winners are big to a degree that violates ourexpectations about variation.  I don\\'t know whether these expectationsare innate or learned, but whatever the cause, we are just notprepared for the 1000x variation in outcomes that one finds instartup investing.That yields all sorts of strange consequences.  For example, inpurely financial terms, there is probably at most one company ineach YC batch that will have a significant effect on our returns,and the rest are just a cost of doing business.I haven\\'treally assimilated that fact, partly because it\\'s so counterintuitive,and partly because we\\'re not doing this just for financial reasons;YC would be a pretty lonely place if we only had one company perbatch.  And yet it\\'s true.To succeed in a domain that violates your intuitions, you need tobe able to turn them off the way a pilot does when flying throughclouds.You need to do what you know intellectually to beright, even though it feels wrong.It\\'s a constant battle for us.  It\\'s hard to make ourselves takeenough risks. When you interview a startup and think \"they seemlikely to succeed,\" it\\'s hard not to fund them.  And yet, financiallyat least, there is only one kind of success: they\\'re either goingto be one of the really big winners or not, and if not it doesn\\'tmatter whether you fund them, because even if they succeed theeffect on your returns will be insignificant.  In the same day ofinterviews you might meet some smart 19 year olds who aren\\'t evensure what they want to work on. Their chances of succeeding seemsmall.  But again, it\\'s not their chances of succeeding that matterbut their chances of succeeding really big.  The probability thatany group will succeed really big is microscopically small, but theprobability that those 19 year olds will might be higher than thatof the other, safer group.The probability that a startup will make it big is not simply aconstant fraction of the probability that they will succeed at all.If it were, you could fund everyone who seemed likely to succeedat all, and you\\'d get that fraction of big hits.  Unfortunatelypicking winners is harder than that.  You have to ignore the elephantin front of you, the likelihood they\\'ll succeed, and focus insteadon the separate and almost invisibly intangible question of whetherthey\\'ll succeed really big.HarderThat\\'s made harder by the fact that the best startup ideas seem atfirst like bad ideas.  I\\'ve written about this before: if a goodidea were obviously good, someone else would already have done it.So the most successful founders tend to work on ideas that fewbeside them realize are good.  Which is not that far from a descriptionof insanity, till you reach the point where you see results.The first time Peter Thiel spoke at YC he drew a Venn diagram thatillustrates the situation perfectly.  He drew two intersectingcircles, one labelled \"seems like a bad idea\" and the other \"is agood idea.\"  The intersection is the sweet spot for startups.This concept is a simple one and yet seeing it as a Venn diagramis illuminating.  It reminds you that there is an intersection—thatthere are good ideas that seem bad.  It also reminds you that thevast majority of ideas that seem bad are bad.The fact that the best ideas seem like bad ideas makes it evenharder to recognize the big winners.  It means the probability ofa startup making it really big is not merely not a constant fractionof the probability that it will succeed, but that the startups witha high probability of the former will seem to have a disproportionatelylow probability of the latter.History tends to get rewritten by big successes, so that in retrospectit seems obvious they were going to make it big.  For that reasonone of my most valuable memories is how lame Facebook sounded tome when I first heard about it.  A site for college students towaste time?  It seemed the perfect bad idea: a site (1) for a nichemarket (2) with no money (3) to do something that didn\\'t matter.One could have described Microsoft and Apple in exactly the sameterms.Harder StillWait, it gets worse.  You not only have to solve this hard problem,but you have to do it with no indication of whether you\\'re succeeding.When you pick a big winner, you won\\'t know it for two years.Meanwhile, the one thing youcanmeasure is dangerouslymisleading.  The one thing we can track precisely is how well thestartups in each batch do at fundraising after Demo Day.  But weknow that\\'s the wrong metric.  There\\'s no correlation between thepercentage of startups that raise money and the metric that doesmatter financially, whether that batch of startups contains a bigwinner or not.Except an inverse one.  That\\'s the scary thing: fundraising is notmerely a useless metric, but positively misleading.  We\\'re in abusiness where we need to pick unpromising-looking outliers, andthe huge scale of the successes means we can afford to spread ournet very widely.  The big winners could generate 10,000x returns.That means for each big winner we could pick a thousand companiesthat returned nothing and still end up 10x ahead.If we ever got to the point where 100% of the startups we fundedwere able to raise money after Demo Day, it would almost certainlymean we were being too conservative.It takes a conscious effort not to do that too.  After 15 cyclesof preparing startups for investors and then watching how they do,I can now look at a group we\\'re interviewing through Demo Dayinvestors\\' eyes.  But those are the wrong eyes to look through!We can afford to take at least 10x as much risk as Demo Day investors.And since risk is usually proportionate to reward, if you can affordto take more risk you should.  What would it mean to take 10x morerisk than Demo Day investors?  We\\'d have to be willing to fund 10xmore startups than they would.  Which means that even if we\\'regenerous to ourselves and assume that YC can on average triple astartup\\'s expected value, we\\'d be taking the right amount of riskif only 30% of the startups were able to raise significant fundingafter Demo Day.I don\\'t know what fraction of them currently raise more after DemoDay.  I deliberately avoid calculating that number, because if youstart measuring something you start optimizing it, and I know it\\'sthe wrong thing to optimize.But the percentage is certainlyway over 30%.  And frankly the thought of a 30% success rate atfundraising makes my stomach clench.  A Demo Day where only 30% ofthe startups were fundable would be a shambles.  Everyone wouldagree that YC had jumped the shark. We ourselves would feel thatYC had jumped the shark.  And yet we\\'d all be wrong.For better or worse that\\'s never going to be more than a thoughtexperiment.  We could never stand it.  How about that forcounterintuitive?  I can lay out what I know to be the right thingto do, and still not do it.  I can make up all sorts of plausiblejustifications.  It would hurt YC\\'s brand (at least among theinnumerate) if we invested in huge numbers of risky startups thatflamed out.  It might dilute the value of the alumni network.Perhaps most convincingly, it would be demoralizing for us to beup to our chins in failure all the time.  But I know the real reasonwe\\'re so conservative is that we just haven\\'t assimilated the factof 1000x variation in returns.We\\'ll probably never be able to bring ourselves to take risksproportionate to the returns in this business.  The best we canhope for is that when we interview a group and find ourselvesthinking \"they seem like good founders, but what are investors goingto think of this crazy idea?\" we\\'ll continue to be able to say \"whocares what investors think?\"  That\\'s what we thought about Airbnb,and if we want to fund more Airbnbs we have to stay good at thinkingit.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'When I talk to a startup that\\'s been operating for more than 8 or9 months, the first thing I want to know is almost always the same.Assuming their expenses remain constant and their revenue growthis what it has been over the last several months, do they make it toprofitability on the money they have left?  Or to put it moredramatically, by default do they live or die?The startling thing is how often the founders themselves don\\'t know.Half the founders I talk to don\\'t know whether they\\'re default aliveor default dead.If you\\'re among that number, Trevor Blackwell has made a handycalculatoryou can use to find out.The reason I want to know first whether a startup is default aliveor default dead is that the rest of the conversation depends on theanswer.  If the company is default alive, we can talk about ambitiousnew things they could do.  If it\\'s default dead, we probably needto talk about how to save it.  We know the current trajectory endsbadly.  How can they get off that trajectory?Why do so few founders know whether they\\'re default alive or defaultdead?  Mainly, I think, because they\\'re not used to asking that.It\\'s not a question that makes sense to ask early on, any more thanit makes sense to ask a 3 year old how he plans to supporthimself.  But as the company grows older, the question switches frommeaningless to critical.  That kind of switch often takes peopleby surprise.I propose the following solution: instead of starting to ask toolate whether you\\'re default alive or default dead, start asking tooearly.  It\\'s hard to say precisely when the question switchespolarity.  But it\\'s probably not that dangerous to start worryingtoo early that you\\'re default dead, whereas it\\'s very dangerous tostart worrying too late.The reason is a phenomenon I wrote about earlier: thefatal pinch.The fatal pinch is default dead + slow growth + not enoughtime to fix it.  And the way founders end up in it is by not realizingthat\\'s where they\\'re headed.There is another reason founders don\\'t ask themselves whether they\\'redefault alive or default dead: they assume it will be easy to raisemore money.  But that assumption is often false, and worse still, themore you depend on it, the falser it becomes.Maybe it will help to separate facts from hopes. Instead of thinkingof the future with vague optimism, explicitly separate the components.Say \"We\\'re default dead, but we\\'re counting on investors to saveus.\" Maybe as you say that, it will set off the same alarms in yourhead that it does in mine.  And if you set off the alarms sufficientlyearly, you may be able to avoid the fatal pinch.It would be safe to be default dead if you could count on investorssaving you.  As a rule their interest is a function ofgrowth.  If you have steep revenue growth, say over 5x a year, youcan start to count on investors being interested even if you\\'re notprofitable.But investors are so fickle that you can neverdo more than start to count on them.  Sometimes something about yourbusiness will spook investors even if your growth is great.  So nomatter how good your growth is, you can never safely treat fundraisingas more than a plan A. You should always have a plan B as well: youshould know (as in write down) precisely what you\\'ll need to do tosurvive if you can\\'t raise more money, and precisely when you\\'ll have to switch to plan B if plan A isn\\'t working.In any case, growing fast versus operating cheaply is far from thesharp dichotomy many founders assume it to be.  In practice thereis surprisingly little connection between how much a startup spendsand how fast it grows.  When a startup grows fast, it\\'s usuallybecause the product hits a nerve, in the sense of hitting some bigneed straight on.  When a startup spends a lot, it\\'s usually becausethe product is expensive to develop or sell, or simply becausethey\\'re wasteful.If you\\'re paying attention, you\\'ll be asking at this point not justhow to avoid the fatal pinch, but how to avoid being default dead.That one is easy: don\\'t hire too fast.  Hiring too fast is by farthe biggest killer of startups that raise money.Founders tell themselves they need to hire in order to grow.  Butmost err on the side of overestimating this need rather thanunderestimating it.  Why?  Partly because there\\'s so much work todo.  Naive founders think that if they can just hire enoughpeople, it will all get done.  Partly because successful startups havelots of employees, so it seems like that\\'s what one does in orderto be successful.  In fact the large staffs of successful startupsare probably more the effect of growth than the cause.  Andpartly because when founders have slow growth they don\\'t want toface what is usually the real reason: the product is not appealingenough.Plus founders who\\'ve just raised money are often encouraged tooverhire by the VCs who funded them.  Kill-or-cure strategies areoptimal for VCs because they\\'re protected by the portfolio effect.VCs want to blow you up, in one sense of the phrase or the other.But as a founder your incentives are different.  You want above allto survive.Here\\'s a common way startups die.  They make something moderatelyappealing and have decent initial growth. They raise their firstround fairly easily, because the founders seem smart and the ideasounds plausible. But because the product is only moderatelyappealing, growth is ok but not great.  The founders convincethemselves that hiring a bunch of people is the way to boost growth.Their investors agree.  But (because the product is only moderatelyappealing) the growth never comes.  Now they\\'re rapidly running outof runway.  They hope further investment will save them. But becausethey have high expenses and slow growth, they\\'re now unappealingto investors. They\\'re unable to raise more, and the company dies.What the company should have done is address the fundamental problem:that the product is only moderately appealing.  Hiring people israrely the way to fix that.  More often than not it makes it harder.At this early stage, the product needs to evolve more than to be\"built out,\" and that\\'s usually easier with fewer people.Asking whether you\\'re default alive or default dead may save youfrom this.  Maybe the alarm bells it sets off will counteract theforces that push you to overhire.  Instead you\\'ll be compelled toseek growth in other ways. For example, bydoingthings that don\\'t scale, or by redesigning the product in theway only founders can.And for many if not most startups, these paths to growth will bethe ones that actually work.Airbnb waited 4 months after raising money at the end of Y\\xa0Combinatorbefore they hired their first employee.  In the meantime the founderswere terribly overworked.  But they were overworked evolving Airbnbinto the astonishingly successful organism it is now.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'The first Summer Founders Program has just finished.  We weresurprised how well it went.  Overall only about 10% of startups   succeed, but if I had to guess now, I\\'d predict three or four of  the eight startups we funded will make it.Of the startups that needed further funding, I believe all haveeither closed a round or are likely to soon.  Two have alreadyturned down (lowball) acquisition offers.We would have been happy if just one of the eight seemed promisingby the end of the summer.  What\\'s going on?  Did some kind of anomalymake this summer\\'s applicants especially good?  We worry about that,but we can\\'t think of one.  We\\'ll find out thiswinter.The whole summer was full of surprises.  The best was that thehypothesiswe were testing seems to becorrect.  Young hackers can start viable companies.  This is goodnews for two reasons: (a) it\\'s an encouraging thought, and (b) it means that Y Combinator, which is predicated on the idea, is nothosed.AgeMore precisely, the hypothesis was that success in a startup dependsmainly on how smart and energetic you are, and much less on how oldyou are or how much business experience you have.  The results sofar bear this out.  The 2005 summer founders ranged in age from 18  to 28 (average 23), and there is no correlation between their agesand how well they\\'re doing.This should not really be surprising. Bill Gates and Michael Dell were both 19 when they started the companies that made them famous.Young founders are not a new phenomenon: the trend began as soonas computers got cheap enough for college kids to afford them.Another of our hypotheses was that you can start a startup on lessmoney than most people think.  Other investors were surprised tohear the most we gave any group was $20,000.  But we knew it waspossible to start on that little because we started Viaweb on$10,000.And so it proved this summer.  Three months\\' funding is enough toget into second gear.  We had a demo day for potential investorsten weeks in, and seven of the eight groups had a prototype readyby that time.  One,Reddit, hadalready launched, and were able to give a demo of their live site.A researcher who studied the SFP startups said the one thing they had in common was that they all worked ridiculously hard.  Peoplethis age are commonly seen as lazy.  I think in some cases it\\'s notso much that they lack the appetite for work, but that the workthey\\'re offered is unappetizing.The experience of the SFP suggests that if you let motivated peopledo real work, they work hard, whatever their age.  As one of thefounders said \"I\\'d read that starting a startup consumed your life,  but I had no idea what that meant until I did it.\"I\\'d feel guilty if I were a boss making people work this hard.  Butwe\\'re not these people\\'s bosses.  They\\'re working on their ownprojects.  And what makes them work is not us but their competitors.Like good athletes, they don\\'t work hard because the coach yellsat them, but because they want to win.We have less power than bosses, and yet the founders work harder  than employees.  It seems like a win for everyone.  The only catchis that we get on average only about 5-7% of the upside, while anemployer gets nearly all of it.  (We\\'re counting on it being 5-7%of a much larger number.)As well as working hard, the groups all turned out to be extraordinarilyresponsible.  I can\\'t think of a time when one failed to do somethingthey\\'d promised to, even by being late for an appointment.  Thisis another lesson the world has yet to learn.  One of the foundersdiscovered that the hardest part of arranging a meeting withexecutives at a big cell phone carrier was getting a rental companyto rent him a car, because he was too young.I think the problem here is much the same as with the apparentlaziness of people this age.  They seem lazy because the work they\\'regiven is pointless, and they act irresponsible because they\\'re notgiven any power.  Some of them, anyway.  We only have a sample sizeof about twenty, but it seems so far that if you let people in theirearly twenties be their own bosses, they rise to the occasion.MoraleThe summer founders were as a rule very idealistic.  They also  wanted very much to get rich.  These qualities might seem incompatible,but they\\'re not.  These guys want to get rich, but they want to doit by changing the world.  They wouldn\\'t (well, seven of the eightgroups wouldn\\'t) be interested in making money by speculating instocks.  They want to make something people use.I think this makes them more effective as founders.  As hard as  people will work for money, they\\'ll work harder for a cause.  And   since success in a startup depends so much on motivation, theparadoxical result is that the people likely to make the most moneyare those who aren\\'t in it just for the money.The founders ofKiko, for example,   are working on an Ajax calendar.  They want to get rich, but theypay more attention to design than they would if that were theironly motivation.  You can tell just by looking at it.I never considered it till this summer, but this might be anotherreason startups run by hackers tend to do better than those run byMBAs.  Perhaps it\\'s not just that hackers understand technologybetter, but that they\\'re driven by more powerful motivations.Microsoft, as I\\'ve said before, is a dangerously misleading example.  Their mean corporate culture only works for monopolies.   Google is a better model.Considering that the summer founders are the sharks in this ocean,we were surprised how frightened most of them were of competitors.But now that I think of it, we were just as frightened when westarted Viaweb.  For the first year, our initial reaction to news of a competitor was always: we\\'re doomed.  Just as a hypochondriacmagnifies his symptoms till he\\'s convinced he has some terribledisease, when you\\'re not used to competitors you magnify them intomonsters.Here\\'s a handy rule for startups: competitors are rarely as dangerousas they seem.  Most will self-destruct before you can destroy them.And it certainly doesn\\'t matter how many of them there are, anymore than it matters to the winner of a marathon how many runnersare behind him.\"It\\'s a crowded market,\" I remember one founder saying worriedly.\"Are you the current leader?\" I asked.\"Yes.\"\"Is anyone able to develop software faster than you?\"\"Probably not.\"\"Well, if you\\'re ahead now, and you\\'re the fastest, then you\\'llstay ahead.  What difference does it make how many others thereare?\"Another group was worried when they realized they had to rewritetheir software from scratch.  I told them it would be a bad signif they didn\\'t.  The main function of your initial version is to  be rewritten.That\\'s why we advise groups to ignore issues like scalability,internationalization, and heavy-duty security at first. [1] I canimagine an advocate of \"best practices\" saying these ought to beconsidered from the start.  And he\\'d be right, except that theyinterfere with the primary function of software in a startup: to  be a vehicle for experimenting with its own design.  Having toretrofit internationalization or scalability is a pain, certainly.  The only bigger pain is not needing to, because your initial versionwas too big and rigid to evolve into something users wanted.I suspect this is another reason startups beat big companies.Startups can be irresponsible and release version 1s that are lightenough to evolve.  In big companies, all the pressure is in the   direction of over-engineering.What Got LearnedOne thing we were curious about this summer was where these groups  would need help.  That turned out to vary a lot.  Some we helpedwith technical advice-- for example, about how to set up an applicationto run on multiple servers.  Most we helped with strategy questions,like what to patent, and what to charge for and what to give away.Nearly all wanted advice about dealing with future investors: how  much money should they take and what kind of terms should theyexpect?However, all the groups quickly learned how to deal with stuff likepatents and investors.  These problems aren\\'t intrinsically difficult,just unfamiliar.It was surprising-- slightly frightening even-- how fast theylearned.  The weekend before the demo day for investors, we had a  practice session where all the groups gave their presentations.  They were all terrible.  We tried to explain how to make them better,but we didn\\'t have much hope.  So on demo day I told the assembledangels and VCs that these guys were hackers, not MBAs, and so whiletheir software was good, we should not expect slick presentations from them.The groups then proceeded to give fabulously slick presentations. Gone were the mumbling recitations of lists of features.   It wasas if they\\'d spent the past week at acting school.  I still don\\'t know how they did it.Perhaps watching each others\\' presentations helped them see whatthey\\'d been doing wrong.  Just as happens in college, the summer   founders learned a lot from one another-- maybe more than theylearned from us.  A lot of the problems they face are the same,  from dealing with investors to hacking Javascript.I don\\'t want to give the impression there were no problems this  summer.  A lot went wrong, as usually happens with startups.  Onegroup got an \"explodingterm-sheet\" from some VCs.  Pretty much all the groups who haddealings with big companies found that big companies do everythinginfinitely slowly.  (This is to be expected.  If big companiesweren\\'t incapable, there would be no room for startups to exist.)And of course there were the usual nightmares associated withservers.In short, the disasters this summer were just the usual childhooddiseases.  Some of this summer\\'s eight startups will   probably die eventually; it would be extraordinary if all eight succeeded.  But what kills them will not be dramatic, external    threats, but a mundane, internal one: not getting enough done.So far, though, the news is all good.  In fact, we were surprisedhow much fun the summer was for us.  The main reason was how muchwe liked the founders.  They\\'re so earnest and hard-working.  Theyseem to like us too.  And this illustrates another advantage ofinvesting over hiring: our relationship with them is way better   than it would be between a boss and an employee.  Y Combinator endsup being more like an older brother than a parent.I was surprised how much time I spent making introductions.Fortunately I discovered that when a startup needed to talk tosomeone, I could usually get to the right person by at most onehop.  I remember wondering, how did my friends get to be so eminent?and a second later realizing: shit, I\\'m forty.Another surprise was that the three-month batch format,which we were forced into by the constraints of the summer, turnedout to be an advantage.  When we started Y Combinator, we plannedto invest the way other venture firms do: as proposals came in,     we\\'d evaluate them and decide yes or no.  The SFPwas just an experiment to get things started.  But it worked sowell that we plan to doallour investing this way, one cycle inthe summer and one in winter.  It\\'s more efficient for us, andbetter for the startups too.Several groups said our weekly dinners saved them from a commonproblem afflicting startups: working so hard that one has no sociallife.  (I remember that part all too well.)  This way, they wereguaranteed a social event at least once a week.IndependenceI\\'ve heard Y Combinator described as an \"incubator.\"  Actually we\\'rethe opposite: incubators exert more control than ordinary VCs, andwe make a point of exerting less.  Among other things, incubatorsusually make you work in their office-- that\\'s where the word \"incubator\" comes from.  That seems the wrong model.  Ifinvestors get too involved, they smother one of the most powerful forces in a startup: the feeling that it\\'s your own company.Incubators were conspicuous failures during the Bubble.  There\\'s  still debate about whether this was because of the Bubble, or becausethey\\'re a bad idea.  My vote is they\\'re a bad idea.  I think they fail because they select for the wrong people.  When we were startinga startup, we would never have taken funding from an \"incubator.\"We can find office space, thanks; just give us the money.  And  people with that attitude are the ones likely to succeed in startups.Indeed, one quality all the founders shared this summer was a spiritof independence.  I\\'ve been wondering about that.  Are some peoplejust a lot more independent than others, or would everyone be thisway if they were allowed to?As with most nature/nurture questions, the answer is probably: someof each.  But my main conclusion from the summer is that there\\'smore environment in the mix than most people realize.  I could seethat from how the founders\\' attitudeschangedduring the   summer.  Most were emerging from twenty or so years of being toldwhat to do.  They seemed a little surprised at having total freedom.But they grew into it really quickly; some of these guys now seemabout four inches taller (metaphorically) than they did at thebeginning of the summer.When we asked the summer founders what surprised them most aboutstarting a company, one said \"the most shocking thing is that it worked.\"It will take more experience to know for sure, but my guess is thata lot of hackers could do this-- that if you put people in a positionof independence, they develop the qualities they need.  Throw themoff a cliff, and most will find on the way down that they have   wings.The reason this is news to anyone is that the same forces work inthe other direction too. Most hackers are employees, and thismoldsyou into someone to whom starting a startup seems impossible assurely as starting a startup molds you into someone who can handleit.If I\\'m right, \"hacker\" will mean something different in twenty yearsthan it does now. Increasingly it will mean the people who run thecompany.  Y Combinator is just accelerating a process that wouldhave happened anyway.  Power is shifting from the people who dealwith money to the people who create technology, and if our experiencethis summer is any guide, this will be a good thing.'},\n",

       "  'date': 'Want to start a startup?',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.November 2005Does \"Web 2.0\" mean anything?  Till recently I thought it didn\\'t,but the truth turns out to be more complicated.  Originally, yes,it was meaningless.  Now it seems to have acquired a meaning.  Andyet those who dislike the term are probably right, because if itmeans what I think it does, we don\\'t need it.I first heard the phrase \"Web 2.0\" in the name of the Web 2.0conference in 2004.  At the time it was supposed to mean using \"theweb as a platform,\" which I took to refer to web-based applications.So I was surprised at a conference this summer when Tim O\\'Reillyled a session intended to figure out a definition of \"Web 2.0.\"Didn\\'t it already mean using the web as a platform?  And if itdidn\\'t already mean something, why did we need the phrase at all?OriginsTim says the phrase \"Web 2.0\" firstarosein \"a brainstorming session betweenO\\'Reilly and Medialive International.\" What is Medialive International?\"Producers of technology tradeshows and conferences,\" according totheir site.  So presumably that\\'s what this brainstorming sessionwas about.  O\\'Reilly wanted to organize a conference about the web,and they were wondering what to call it.I don\\'t think there was any deliberate plan to suggest there was anewversionof the web.  They just wanted to make the pointthat the web mattered again.  It was a kind of semantic deficitspending: they knew new things were coming, and the \"2.0\" referredto whatever those might turn out to be.And they were right.  New things were coming.  But the new versionnumber led to some awkwardness in the short term.  In the processof developing the pitch for the first conference, someone must havedecided they\\'d better take a stab at explaining what that \"2.0\"referred to.  Whatever it meant, \"the web as a platform\" was atleast not too constricting.The story about \"Web 2.0\" meaning the web as a platform didn\\'t livemuch past the first conference.  By the second conference, what\"Web 2.0\" seemed to mean was something about democracy.  At least,it did when people wrote about it online.  The conference itselfdidn\\'t seem very grassroots.  It cost $2800, so the only people whocould afford to go were VCs and people from big companies.And yet, oddly enough, Ryan Singel\\'sarticleabout the conference inWired Newsspoke of \"throngs ofgeeks.\"  When a friend of mine asked Ryan about this, it was newsto him.  He said he\\'d originally written something like \"throngsof VCs and biz dev guys\" but had later shortened it just to \"throngs,\"and that this must have in turn been expanded by the editors into\"throngs of geeks.\"  After all, a Web 2.0 conference would presumablybe full of geeks, right?Well, no.  There were about 7.  Even Tim O\\'Reilly was wearing a   suit, a sight so alien I couldn\\'t parse it at first.  I sawhim walk by and said to one of the O\\'Reilly people \"that guy looksjust like Tim.\"\"Oh, that\\'s Tim.  He bought a suit.\"I ran after him, and sure enough, it was.  He explained that he\\'djust bought it in Thailand.The 2005 Web 2.0 conference reminded me of Internet trade showsduring the Bubble, full of prowling VCs looking for the next hotstartup.  There was that same odd atmosphere created by a large  number of people determined not to miss out.  Miss out on what?They didn\\'t know.  Whatever was going to happen—whatever Web 2.0turned out to be.I wouldn\\'t quite call it \"Bubble 2.0\" just because VCs are eagerto invest again.  The Internet is a genuinely big deal.  The bustwas as much anoverreactionasthe boom.  It\\'s to be expected that once we started to pull out ofthe bust, there would be a lot of growth in this area, just as therewas in the industries that spiked the sharpest before the Depression.The reason this won\\'t turn into a second Bubble is that the IPOmarket is gone.Venture investorsare driven by exit strategies.  The reason they were funding all  those laughable startups during the late 90s was that they hopedto sell them to gullible retail investors; they hoped to be laughingall the way to the bank.  Now that route is closed.  Now the defaultexit strategy is to get bought, and acquirers are less prone toirrational exuberance than IPO investors.  The closest you\\'ll get to Bubble valuations is Rupert Murdoch paying $580 million for   Myspace.  That\\'s only off by a factor of 10 or so.1. AjaxDoes \"Web 2.0\" mean anything more than the name of a conferenceyet?  I don\\'t like to admit it, but it\\'s starting to.  When peoplesay \"Web 2.0\" now, I have some idea what they mean.  And the factthat I both despise the phrase and understand it is the surest proofthat it has started to mean something.One ingredient of its meaning is certainly Ajax, which I can stillonly just bear to use without scare quotes.  Basically, what \"Ajax\"means is \"Javascript now works.\"  And that in turn means thatweb-based applications can now be made to work much more like desktopones.As you read this, a whole newgenerationof software is being written to take advantage of Ajax.  Therehasn\\'t been such a wave of new applications since microcomputersfirst appeared.  Even Microsoft sees it, but it\\'s too late for themto do anything more thanleak\"internal\"  documents designed to give the impression they\\'re on top of thisnew trend.In fact the new generation of software is being written way toofast for Microsoft even to channel it, let alone write their ownin house.  Their only hope now is to buy all the best Ajax startupsbefore Google does.  And even that\\'s going to be hard, becauseGoogle has as big a head start in buying microstartups as it didin search a few years ago.  After all, Google Maps, the canonicalAjax application, was the result of a startup theybought.So ironically the original description of the Web 2.0 conferenceturned out to be partially right: web-based applications are a bigcomponent of Web 2.0.  But I\\'m convinced they got this right by accident.  The Ajax boom didn\\'t start till early 2005, when GoogleMaps appeared and the term \"Ajax\" wascoined.2. DemocracyThe second big element of Web 2.0 is democracy.  We now have severalexamples to prove thatamateurscan   surpass professionals, when they have the right kind of system to channel their efforts.Wikipediamay be the most famous.  Experts have given Wikipedia middlingreviews, but they miss the critical point: it\\'s good enough.  And   it\\'s free, which means people actually read it.  On the web, articlesyou have to pay for might as well not exist.  Even if you were    willing to pay to read them yourself, you can\\'t link to them.    They\\'re not part of the conversation.Another place democracy seems to win is in deciding what counts asnews.  I never look at any news site now exceptReddit.I know if something majorhappens, or someone writes a particularly interesting article, it   will show up there.  Why bother checking the front page of anyspecific paper or magazine?  Reddit\\'s like an RSS feed for the wholeweb, with a filter for quality.  Similar sites includeDigg, a technology news site that\\'srapidly approaching Slashdot in popularity, anddel.icio.us, the collaborativebookmarking network that set off the \"tagging\" movement.  And whereasWikipedia\\'s main appeal is that it\\'s good enough and free, thesesites suggest that voters do a significantly better job than humaneditors.The most dramatic example of Web 2.0 democracy is not in the selectionof ideas, but their production.I\\'ve noticed for a while that the stuff I read on individual people\\'ssites is as good as or better than the stuff I read in newspapersand magazines.  And now I have independent evidence: the top linkson Reddit are generally links to individual people\\'s sites rather  than to magazine articles or news stories.My experience of writingfor magazines suggests an explanation.  Editors.  They control thetopics you can write about, and they can generally rewrite whateveryou produce.  The result is to damp extremes.  Editing yields 95thpercentile writing—95% of articles are improved by it, but 5% aredragged down.  5% of the time you get \"throngs of geeks.\"On the web, people can publish whatever they want.  Nearly all ofit falls short of the editor-damped writing in print publications.But the pool of writers is very, very large.  If it\\'s large enough,the lack of damping means the best writing online should surpass  the best in print.And now that the web has evolved mechanismsfor selecting good stuff, the web wins net.  Selection beats damping,for the same reason market economies beat centrally planned ones.Even the startups are different this time around.  They are to the  startups of the Bubble what bloggers are to the print media.  Duringthe Bubble, a startup meant a company headed by an MBA that was   blowing through several million dollars of VC money to \"get bigfast\" in the most literal sense.  Now it means a smaller,younger, more technical group that just      decided to make something great.  They\\'ll decide later if they want  to raise VC-scale funding, and if they take it, they\\'ll take it ontheir terms.3. Don\\'t Maltreat UsersI think everyone would agree that democracy and Ajax are elementsof \"Web 2.0.\"  I also see a third: not to maltreat users.  Duringthe Bubble a lot of popular sites were quite high-handed with users.And not just in obvious ways, like making them register, or subjectingthem to annoying ads.  The very design of the average site in the   late 90s was an abuse.  Many of the most popular sites were loadedwith obtrusive branding that made them slow to load and sent theuser the message: this is our site, not yours.  (There\\'s a physicalanalog in the Intel and Microsoftstickersthat come on somelaptops.)I think the root of the problem was that sites felt they were givingsomething away for free, and till recently a company giving anythingaway for free could be pretty high-handed about it.  Sometimes itreached the point of economic sadism: site owners assumed that themore pain they caused the user, the more benefit it must be to them.  The most dramatic remnant of this model may be at salon.com, where   you can read the beginning of a story, but to get the rest you havesit through amovie.At Y Combinator we advise all the startups we fund never to lordit over users.  Never make users register, unless you need to inorder to store something for them.  If you do make users register,   never make them wait for a confirmation link in an email; in fact,don\\'t even ask for their email address unless you need it for somereason.  Don\\'t ask them any unnecessary questions.  Never send thememail unless they explicitly ask for it.  Never frame pages youlink to, or open them in new windows.  If you have a free version and a pay version, don\\'t make the free version too restricted.  Andif you find yourself asking \"should we allow users to do x?\" just answer \"yes\" whenever you\\'re unsure.  Err on the side of generosity.InHow to Start a StartupI advised startupsnever to let anyone fly under them, meaning never to let any othercompany offer a cheaper, easier solution.  Another way to fly low is to give users more power.  Let users do what they want.  If you don\\'t and a competitor does, you\\'re in trouble.iTunes is Web 2.0ish in this sense.  Finally you can buy individualsongs instead of having to buy whole albums.  The recording industryhated the idea and resisted it as long as possible.  But it wasobvious what users wanted, so Apple flew under the labels.Though really it might be better to describe iTunes as Web 1.5.     Web 2.0 applied to music would probably mean individual bands givingaway DRMless songs for free.The ultimate way to be nice to users is to give them something forfree that competitors charge for.  During the 90s a lot of people   probably thought we\\'d have some working system for micropayments     by now.  In fact things have gone in the other direction.  The most   successful sites are the ones that figure out new ways to give stuffaway for free.  Craigslist has largely destroyed the classified adsites of the 90s, and OkCupid looks likely to do the same to theprevious generation of dating sites.Serving web pages is very, very cheap.  If you can make even a   fraction of a cent per page view, you can make a profit.  Andtechnology for targeting ads continues to improve.  I wouldn\\'t besurprised if ten years from now eBay had been supplanted by an      ad-supported freeBay (or, more likely, gBay).Odd as it might sound, we tell startups that they should try tomake as little money as possible.  If you can figure out a way toturn a billion dollar industry into a fifty million dollar industry,so much the better, if all fifty million go to you.  Though indeed,making things cheaper often turns out to generate more money in theend, just as automating things often turns out to generate morejobs.The ultimate target is Microsoft.  What a bang that balloon is goingto make when someone pops it by offering a free web-based alternative to MS Office.Who will?  Google?  They seem to be taking theirtime.  I suspect the pin will be wielded by a couple of 20 year oldhackers who are too naive to be intimidated by the idea.  (How hardcan it be?)The Common ThreadAjax, democracy, and not dissing users.  What do they all have in  common?  I didn\\'t realize they had anything in common till recently,which is one of the reasons I disliked the term \"Web 2.0\" so much.It seemed that it was being used as a label for whatever happenedto be new—that it didn\\'t predict anything.But there is a common thread.  Web 2.0 means using the web the wayit\\'s meant to be used.  The \"trends\" we\\'re seeing now are simplythe inherent nature of the web emerging from under the broken modelsthat got imposed on it during the Bubble.I realized this when I read aninterview withJoe Kraus, the co-founder of Excite.Excite really never got the business model right at all.  We fell   into the classic problem of how when a new medium comes out it  adopts the practices, the content, the business models of the old  medium—which fails, and then the more appropriate models get  figured out.It may have seemed as if not much was happening during the yearsafter the Bubble burst.  But in retrospect, something was happening:the web was finding its natural angle of repose.  The democracy component, for example—that\\'s not an innovation, in the sense ofsomething someone made happen.  That\\'s what the web naturally tendsto produce.Ditto for the idea of delivering desktop-like applications over theweb.  That idea is almost as old as the web.  But the first time    around it was co-opted by Sun, and we got Java applets.  Java hassince been remade into a generic replacement for C++, but in 1996the story about Java was that it represented a new model of software.Instead of desktop applications, you\\'d run Java \"applets\" deliveredfrom a server.This plan collapsed under its own weight. Microsoft helped kill it,but it would have died anyway.  There was no uptake among hackers.When you findPR firmspromotingsomething as the next development platform, you can be sure it\\'snot.  If it were, you wouldn\\'t need PR firms to tell you, because   hackers would already be writing stuff on top of it, the way sites    likeBusmonsterused Google Maps as aplatform before Google even meant it to be one.The proof that Ajax is the next hot platform is that thousands of  hackers have spontaneously started building things on topof it.  Mikey likes it.There\\'s another thing all three components of Web 2.0 have in common.Here\\'s a clue.  Suppose you approached investors with the followingidea for a Web 2.0 startup:Sites like del.icio.us and flickr allow users to \"tag\" content  with descriptive tokens.  But there is also huge source ofimplicittags that they ignore: the text within web links.  Moreover, these links represent a social network connecting the     individuals and organizations who created the pages, and by using  graph theory we can compute from this network an estimate of the  reputation of each member.  We plan to mine the web for these   implicit tags, and use them together with the reputation hierarchy  they embody to enhance web searches.How long do you think it would take them on average to realize thatit was a description of Google?Google was a pioneer in all three components of Web 2.0: their corebusiness sounds crushingly hip when described in Web 2.0 terms, \"Don\\'t maltreat users\" is a subset of \"Don\\'t be evil,\" and of courseGoogle set off the whole Ajax boom with Google Maps.Web 2.0 means using the web as it was meant to be used, and Googledoes.  That\\'s their secret.They\\'re sailing with the wind, instead of sitting  becalmed praying for a business model, like the print media, or   trying to tack upwind by suing their customers, like Microsoft and the record labels.Google doesn\\'t try to force things to happen their way.  They try   to figure out what\\'s going to happen, and arrange to be standing there when it does.  That\\'s the way to approach technology—and as business includes an ever larger technological component, theright way to do business.The fact that Google is a \"Web 2.0\" company shows that, whilemeaningful, the term is also rather bogus.  It\\'s like the word\"allopathic.\"  It just means doing things right, and it\\'s a bad   sign when you have a special word for that.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Y Combinator\\'s 7th birthday was March 11.   As usual we were sobusy we didn\\'t notice till a few days after.  I don\\'t think we\\'veever managed to remember our birthday on our birthday.On March 11 2005, Jessica and I were walking home from dinner inHarvard Square.  Jessica was working at an investment bank at thetime, but she didn\\'t like it much, so she had interviewed for a jobas director of marketing at a Boston VC fund.  The VC fund was doingwhat now seems a comically familiar thing for a VC fund to do:taking a long time to make up their mind.  Meanwhile I had beentelling Jessica all the things they should change about the VCbusiness — essentially the ideas now underlying Y\\xa0Combinator:investorsshould be making more, smaller investments, they should be fundinghackers instead of suits, they should be willing to fund youngerfounders, etc.At the time I had been thinking about doing some angel investing.  Ihad just given a talk to the undergraduate computer club at Harvardabouthow to start astartup, and ithit me afterward that although I had alwaysmeant to do angel investing, 7 years had now passed since I gotenough money to do it, and I still hadn\\'t started.  I had alsobeen thinking about ways to work with Robert Morris and TrevorBlackwell again.  A few hours before I hadsent them an email trying to figure out what we could do together.Between Harvard Square and my house the idea gelled.  We\\'d startour own investment firm and Jessica could work for that instead.As we turned onto Walker Street we decided to do it.  I agreed toput $100k into the new fund and Jessica agreed to quit her job towork for it.  Over the next couple days I recruited Robertand Trevor, who put in another $50k each.  So YCstarted with $200k.Jessica was so happy to be able to quit her job and start her owncompany that I took herpicturewhen we got home.The company wasn\\'t called Y Combinator yet. At first we called itCambridge Seed.  But that name never saw the light of day, becauseby the time we announced it a few days later, we\\'d changed the nameto Y Combinator.  We realized early on that what we were doing couldbe national in scope and we didn\\'t want a name that tied us to oneplace.Initially we only had part of the idea. We were going to doseed funding with standardized terms.  Before YC, seed funding wasvery haphazard. You\\'d get that first $10k from your friend\\'s richuncle. The deal terms were often a disaster; often neither theinvestor nor the founders nor the lawyer knew what the documentsshould look like.  Facebook\\'s early history as a Florida LLC showshow random things could be in those days.  We were going to besomething there had not been before: a standard source of seedfunding.We modelled YC on the seed funding we ourselves had takenwhen we started Viaweb.  We started Viaweb with $10k we got fromour friendJulian Weber,the husband of Idelle Weber, whosepainting class I took as a grad student at Harvard.  Julian knewabout business, but you would not describe him as a suit.  Amongother things he\\'d been president of theNational Lampoon.  He wasalso a lawyer, and got all our paperwork set up properly.  In returnfor $10k, getting us set up as a company, teaching us whatbusiness was about, and remaining calm in times of crisis, Juliangot 10% of Viaweb.  I remember thinking once what a good dealJulian got.  And then a second later I realized that withoutJulian, Viaweb would never have made it.  So even though it was agood deal for him, it was a good deal for us too.  That\\'s why Iknew there was room for something like Y Combinator.Initially we didn\\'t have what turned out to be the most importantidea: funding startups synchronously, instead of asynchronously asit had always been done before.  Or rather we had the idea, but wedidn\\'t realize its significance.  We decided very early that the first thing we\\'d do wouldbe to fund a bunch of startups over the coming summer.  But wedidn\\'t realize initially that this would be the way we\\'d do all ourinvesting.  The reason we began by funding a bunch of startups atonce was not that we thought it would be a better way to fundstartups, but simply because we wanted to learn how to be angelinvestors, and a summer program for undergrads seemed the fastestway to do it.  No one takes summer jobs that seriously.  Theopportunity cost for a bunch of undergrads to spend a summer workingon startups was low enough that we wouldn\\'t feel guilty encouragingthem to do it.We knew students would already be making plans for the summer, sowe did what we\\'re always telling startups to do: we launched fast.Here are theinitialannouncementanddescriptionof whatwas at the time called the Summer Founders Program.We got lucky in that the length and structure of a summer programturns out to be perfect for what we do.The structure of the YC cycle is still almost identical to whatit was that first summer.We also got lucky in who the first batch of founders were.  We neverexpected to make any money from that first batch.  We thought ofthe money we were investing as a combination of an educational expenseand a charitable donation.  But thefounders in the first batch turned out to be surprisingly good.And great people too.  We\\'re still friends with a lot of them today.It\\'s hard for people to realize now how inconsequential YC seemed at thetime.  I can\\'t blame people who didn\\'t take us seriously, becausewe ourselves didn\\'t take that first summer program seriously in thevery beginning.  But as the summer progressed we were increasinglyimpressed by how well the startups were doing.  Other people startedto be impressed too.  Jessica and I invented a term, \"the Y Combinatoreffect,\" to describe the moment when the realization hit someonethat YC was not totally lame.  When people came to YC to speakat the dinners that first summer, they came in the spirit of someonecoming to address a Boy Scout troop.  By the time they left thebuilding they were all saying some variant of \"Wow, thesecompanies might actually succeed.\"Now YC is well enough known that people are no longer surprisedwhen the companies we fund are legit, but it took awhile for reputation to catch up with reality.  That\\'s one of thereasons we especially like funding ideas that might be dismissedas \"toys\" — because YC itself was dismissed as one initially.When we saw how well it worked to fund companies synchronously,we decided we\\'d keep doing that.  We\\'d fund two batches ofstartups a year.We funded the second batch in Silicon Valley.  That wasa last minute decision.  In retrospect I think what pushed me overthe edge was going to Foo Camp that fall.  The density of startuppeople in the Bay Area was so much greater than in Boston, and theweather was so nice.  I remembered that from living there in the90s.  Plus I didn\\'t want someone else to copy us and describe itas the Y Combinator of Silicon Valley.  I wanted YC to be the Y\\xa0Combinator of Silicon Valley.  So doing the winter batch in Californiaseemed like one of those rare cases where the self-indulgent choiceand the ambitious one were the same.If we\\'d had enough time to do what we wanted, Y Combinator wouldhave been in Berkeley.  That was our favorite part of the Bay Area.But we didn\\'t have time to get a building in Berkeley.  We didn\\'thave time to get our own building anywhere. The only way to getenough space in time was to convince Trevor to let us take overpart of his (as it then seemed) giant building in Mountain View.Yet again we lucked out, because Mountain View turned out to be theideal place to put something like YC.  But even then we barely madeit.  The first dinner in California, we had to warn all the foundersnot to touch the walls, because the paint was still wet.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.March 2005(Parts of this essay began as replies to students who wrote tome with questions.)Recently I\\'ve had several emails from computer scienceundergrads asking what to do in college. I might notbe the best source of advice, because I was a philosophy major incollege.  But I took so many CS classes that most CS majors thoughtI was one.  I was certainly a hacker, at least.HackingWhat should you do in college to become agood hacker?  There are twomain things you can do: become very good at programming, and learna lot about specific, cool problems.  These turn out to be equivalent,because each drives you to do the other.The way to be good at programming is to work (a) a lot (b) on hardproblems.  And the way to make yourself work on hard problems isto work on some very engaging project.Odds are this project won\\'t be a class assignment.  My friend Robertlearned a lot by writing network software when he was anundergrad. One of his projects was to connect Harvard to theArpanet; it had been one of the original nodes, but by 1984 theconnection had died. [1]  Not only was thiswork not for a class, but because he spent all his time on itand neglected his studies, he was kicked out ofschool for a year. [2]  It all evened out in the end, and now he\\'sa professor at MIT.  But you\\'ll probably be happier if you don\\'tgo to that extreme; it caused him a lot of worry at the time.Another way to be good at programming is to find other people whoare good at it, and learn what they know.  Programmers tend to sortthemselves into tribes according to the type of work they do andthe tools they use, and some tribes aresmarterthan others.  Lookaround you and see what the smart people seem to be working on;there\\'s usually a reason.Some of the smartest people around you are professors.  So one wayto find interesting work is to volunteer as a research assistant.Professors are especially interested in people who can solve tedioussystem-administration type problems for them, so that is a way toget a foot in the door.  What they fear areflakes and resume padders.  It\\'s all toocommon for an assistant to result in a net increase in work.  Soyou have to make it clear you\\'ll mean a net decrease.Don\\'t be put off if they say no.  Rejection is almost always lesspersonal than the rejectee imagines.  Just move on to the next.(This applies to dating too.)Beware, because although most professors are smart, not all of themwork on interesting stuff.  Professors have to publish novel resultsto advance their careers, but there is more competition in moreinteresting areas of research.  So what less ambitious professorsdo is turn out a series of papers whose conclusions are novel becauseno one else cares about them.  You\\'re better off avoiding these.I never worked as a research assistant, so I feel a bit dishonestrecommending that route.  I learned to program by writing stuff ofmy own, particularly by trying to reverse-engineer Winograd\\'sSHRDLU.  I was as obsessed with that program as a mother with a new baby.Whatever the disadvantages of working by yourself, the advantageis that the project is all your own.  You never have to compromiseor ask anyone\\'s permission, and if you have a new idea you can justsit down and start implementing it.In your own projects you don\\'t have to worry about novelty (asprofessors do) or profitability (as businesses do).  All that mattersis how hard the project is technically, and that has no correlationto the nature of the application.  \"Serious\" applications like   databases are often trivial and dull technically (if you ever sufferfrom insomnia, try reading the technical literature about databases)while \"frivolous\" applications like games are often very sophisticated.I\\'m sure there are game companies out there working on productswith more intellectual content than the research at thebottom nine tenths of university CS departments.If I were in college now I\\'d probably work ongraphics: a network game, for example, or a tool for 3D animation.When I was an undergrad there weren\\'t enough cycles around to makegraphics interesting, but it\\'s hard to imagine anything more funto work on now.MathWhen I was in college, a lot of the professors believed (or at leastwished) thatcomputer sciencewas a branch of math.  This idea wasstrongest at Harvard, where there wasn\\'t even a CS major till the1980s; till then one had to major in applied math.  But it wasnearly as bad at Cornell.  When I told the fearsome Professor Conwaythat I was interested in AI (a hot topic then), he told me I shouldmajor in math.  I\\'m still not sure whether he thought AI requiredmath, or whether he thought AI was nonsense and that majoring insomething rigorous would cure me of such stupid ambitions.In fact, the amount of math you need as a hacker is a lot less   than most university departments like to admit.  I don\\'t think you  need much more than high school math plus a few concepts from thetheory of computation.  (You have to know what an n^2 algorithm isif you want to avoid writing them.) Unless you\\'re planning to writemath applications, of course.  Robotics, for example, is all math.But while you don\\'t literally need math for most kinds of hacking,in the sense of knowing 1001 tricks for differentiating formulas, math is very much worth studying for its own sake.  It\\'s a valuable source of metaphors for almost any kind of work.[3] I wish I\\'d studied more math in college for that reason.Like a lot of people, I was mathematically abused as a child.  I   learned to think of math as a collection of formulas that wereneither beautiful nor had any relation to my life (despite attemptsto translate them into \"word problems\"), but had to be memorized in order to do well on tests.One of the most valuable things you could do in college would beto learn what math is really about.  This may not be easy, becausea lot of good mathematicians are bad teachers.  And while there aremany popular books on math, few seem good.  The best I can thinkof are W. W. Sawyer\\'s.  And of course Euclid. [4]EverythingThomas Huxley said \"Try to learn something about everything and everything about something.\"  Most universities aim at thisideal.But what\\'s everything?  To me it means, all that peoplelearn in the course of working honestly on hard problems.  All such work tends to be related, in that ideas and techniques from one   field can often be transplanted successfully to others.  Even othersthat seem quite distant.  For example, I writeessaysthe same wayI write software: I sit down and blow out a lame version 1 as fastas I can type, then spend several weeks rewriting it.Working on hard problems is not, by itself, enough.  Medieval   alchemists were working on a hard problem, but their approach was so bogus that there was littleto learn from studying it, except possibly about people\\'s ability  to delude themselves.  Unfortunately the sort of AI I was trying    to learn in college had the same flaw: a very hard problem, blithelyapproached with hopelessly inadequate techniques.  Bold?  Closer to fraudulent.The social sciences are also fairly bogus, because they\\'re so much influenced by intellectualfashions.  If a physicist met a colleaguefrom 100 years ago, he could teach him some new things; if a psychologistmet a colleague from 100 years ago, they\\'d just get into anideological argument.Yes, of course, you\\'ll learn something by taking apsychology class.  The point is, you\\'ll learn more by takinga class in another department.The worthwhile departments, in my opinion, are math, the hardsciences, engineering, history (especially economic and social  history, and the history of science), architecture, and the classics.A survey course in art history may be worthwhile.  Modern literatureis important, but the way to learn about it is just to read.  Idon\\'t know enough about music to say.You can skip the social sciences, philosophy, and the variousdepartments created recently in response to political pressures.Many of these fields talk about important problems, certainly.  Butthe way they talk about them is useless.  For example, philosophy   talks, among other things, about our obligations to one another;    but you can learn more about this from a wise grandmother or E. B.White than from an academic philosopher.I speak here from experience.  I should probably have been offended when people laughed at Clinton for saying \"It depends on what the  meaning of the word \\'is\\' is.\"  I took about five classes in collegeon what the meaning of \"is\" is.Another way to figure out which fields are worth studying is to  create thedropout graph.For example, I know many people  who switched from math to computer science because they found math  too hard, and no one who did the opposite.  People don\\'t do hardthings gratuitously; no one will work on a harder problem unless  it is proportionately (or at least log(n)) more rewarding.  Soprobably math is more worth studying than computer science.  Bysimilar comparisons you can make a graph of all the departments ina university.  At the bottom you\\'ll find the subjects with least intellectual content.If you use this method, you\\'ll get roughly the same answer I just gave.Language courses are an anomaly.  I think they\\'re better consideredas extracurricular activities, like pottery classes.  They\\'d be farmore useful when combined with some time living in a country where the language is spoken.  On a whim I studied Arabic as a freshman.It was a lot of work, and the only lasting benefits were a weird  ability to identify semitic roots and some insights into how peoplerecognize words.Studio art and creative writing courses are wildcards.  Usually you don\\'t get taught much:  you just work (or don\\'t work) on whateveryou want, and then sit around offering \"crits\" of one another\\'screations under the vague supervision of the teacher.  But writing andart are both very hard problems that (some) people work honestlyat, so they\\'re worth doing, especially if you can find a goodteacher.JobsOf course college students have to think about more than justlearning.  There are also two practical problems to consider: jobs,and graduate school.In theory a liberal education is not supposed to supply job training.But everyone knows this is a bit of a fib.  Hackers at every collegelearn practical skills, and not by accident.What you should learn to get a job depends on the kind you want.If you want to work in a big company, learn how to hackBlubonWindows.  If you want to work at a cool little company or research  lab, you\\'ll do better to learn Ruby on Linux.  And if you want to  start your own company, which I think will be more and more common,master the most powerful tools you can find, because you\\'re goingto be in a race against your competitors, and they\\'ll be your horse.There is not a direct correlation between the skills you should    learn in college and those you\\'ll use in a job.  You should aim     slightly high in college.In workouts a football player may bench press 300 pounds, eventhough he may never have to exert anything like that much force inthe course of a game.  Likewise, if your professors try to make youlearn stuff that\\'s more advanced than you\\'ll need in a job, it maynot just be because they\\'re academics, detached from the real world.They may be trying to make you lift weights with your brain.The programs you write in classes differ in three critical waysfrom the ones you\\'ll write in the real world: they\\'re small; youget to start from scratch; and the problem is usually artificial   and predetermined.  In the real world, programs are bigger, tend   to involve existing code, and often require you to figure out what the problem is before you can solve it.You don\\'t have to wait to leave (or even enter) college to learn   these skills.  If you want to learn how to deal with existing code,for example, you can contribute to open-source projects.  The sortof employer you want to work for will be as impressed by that as good grades on class assignments.In existing open-source projects you don\\'t get much practice atthe third skill, deciding what problems to solve.  But there\\'s nothing to stop you starting new projects of your own.  And  goodemployers will be even more impressedwith that.What sort of problem should you try to solve?  One way to answerthat is to ask what you need as a user.  For example, I stumbledon a good algorithm for spam filtering because I wanted to stop  getting spam.  Now what I wish I had was a mail reader that somehowprevented my inbox from filling up.  I tend to use my inbox as atodo list.  But that\\'s like using a screwdriver to openbottles; what one really wants is a bottle opener.Grad SchoolWhat about grad school?  Should you go?  And how do you get into a  good one?In principle, grad school is professional training in research, andyou shouldn\\'t go unless you want to do research as a career.  And   yet half the people who get PhDs in CS don\\'t go into research.I didn\\'t go to grad school to become a professor.  I went because   I wanted to learn more.So if you\\'re mainly interested in hacking and you go to grad school,you\\'ll find a lot of other people who are similarly out of their  element.  And if half the people around you are out of their element in thesame way you are, are you really out of your element?There\\'s a fundamental problem in \"computer science,\" and it surfacesin situations like this.  No one is sure what \"research\" is supposed to be.  A lotof research is hacking that had to be crammed into the form of anacademic paper to yield one more quantum of publication.So it\\'s kind of misleading to ask whether you\\'ll be at home in gradschool, because very few people are quite at home in computerscience.  The whole field is uncomfortable in its own skin.  Sothe fact that you\\'re mainly interested in hacking shouldn\\'t deter  you from going to grad school.  Just be warned you\\'ll have to do a lot of stuff   you don\\'t like.Number one will be your dissertation.  Almost everyone hates theirdissertation by the time they\\'re done with it.  Theprocess inherently tends to produce an unpleasant result, like a cake made outof whole wheat flour and baked for twelve hours.  Few dissertations are read with pleasure, especially by their authors.But thousands before you have suffered through writing a dissertation.And aside from that, grad school is close to paradise.  Many peopleremember it as the happiest time of their lives.  And nearly allthe rest, including me, remember it as a period that would have been, if they hadn\\'t had to write a dissertation. [5]The danger with grad school is that you don\\'t see the scary partupfront.  PhD programs start out as college part 2, with severalyears of classes.  So by the time you face the horror of writing a  dissertation, you\\'re already several years in.  If you quit now,you\\'ll be a grad-school dropout, and you probably won\\'t like thatidea.  When Robert got kicked out of grad school for writing theInternet worm of 1988, I envied him enormously for finding a way outwithout the stigma of failure.On the whole, grad school is probably better than most alternatives.  You meet a lot of smart people, and your glum procrastination will at least    be a powerful common bond.  And of course you have a PhD at theend.  I forgot about that. I suppose that\\'s worth something.The greatest advantage of a PhD (besides being the union card ofacademia, of course) may be that it gives you some baseline confidence.For example, the Honeywell thermostats in my house have the mostatrocious UI.  My mother, who has the same model, diligently spenta day reading the user\\'s manual to learn how to operate hers.  Sheassumed the problem was with her.  But I can think to myself \"Ifsomeone with a PhD in computer science can\\'t understand thisthermostat, itmustbe badly designed.\"If you still want to go to grad school after this equivocalrecommendation, I can give you solid advice about how to get in. A lot of my friends are CS professors now, so I have the insidestory about admissions.  It\\'s quite different from college.  Atmost colleges, admissions officers decide who gets in.  For PhDprograms, the professors do.  And they try to doit well, because the people they admit are going to be working forthem.Apparently only recommendations really matter at the best schools.Standardized tests count for nothing, and grades for little.  Theessay is mostly an opportunity to disqualify yourself by saying   something stupid.  The only thing professorstrust is recommendations, preferably from people they know. [6]So if you want to get into a PhD program, the key is to impressyour professors.  And from my friends who are professors I know what impresses them: not merely trying to impress them.  They\\'renot impressed by students who get good grades or want to be theirresearch assistants so they can get into grad school.  They\\'reimpressed by students who get good grades and want to be their  research assistants because they\\'re genuinely interested in the topic.So the best thing you can do in college, whether you want to getinto grad school or just be good at hacking, is figure out what youtruly like.  It\\'s hard to trick professors into letting you intograd school, and impossible to trick problems into letting you solvethem.  College is where faking stops working.  From this point,unless you want to go work for a big company, which is like revertingto high school, the only way forward is through doing what youlove.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'When intellectuals talk about the death penalty, they talk aboutthings like whether it\\'s permissible for the state to take someone\\'slife, whether the death penalty acts as a deterrent, and whethermore death sentences are given to some groups than others. But inpractice the debate about the death penalty is not about whetherit\\'s ok to kill murderers. It\\'s about whether it\\'s ok to killinnocent people, because at least 4% of people on death row areinnocent.When I was a kid I imagined that it was unusual for people to beconvicted of crimes they hadn\\'t committed, and that in murder casesespecially this must be very rare. Far from it. Now, thanks toorganizations like theInnocence Project,we see a constant streamof stories about murder convictions being overturned after newevidence emerges. Sometimes the police and prosecutors were justvery sloppy. Sometimes they were crooked, and knew full well theywere convicting an innocent person.Kenneth Adams and three other men spent 18 years in prison on amurder conviction. They were exonerated after DNA testing implicatedthree different men, two of whom later confessed. The police hadbeen told about the other men early in the investigation, but neverfollowed up the lead.Keith Harward spent 33 years in prison on a murder conviction. Hewas convicted because \"experts\" said his teeth matched photos ofbite marks on one victim. He was exonerated after DNA testing showedthe murder had been committed by another man, Jerry Crotty.Ricky Jackson and two other men spent 39 years in prison after beingconvicted of murder on the testimony of a 12 year old boy, who laterrecanted and said he\\'d been coerced by police. Multiple people haveconfirmed the boy was elsewhere at the time. The three men wereexonerated after the county prosecutor dropped the charges, saying\"The state is conceding the obvious.\"Alfred Brown spent 12 years in prison on a murder conviction,including 10 years on death row. He was exonerated after it wasdiscovered that the assistant district attorney had concealed phonerecords proving he could not have committed the crimes.Glenn Ford spent 29 years on death row after having been convictedof murder. He was exonerated after new evidence proved he was noteven at the scene when the murder occurred. The attorneys assignedto represent him had never tried a jury case before.Cameron Willingham was actually executed in 2004 by lethal injection.The \"expert\" who testified that he deliberately set fire to hishouse has since been discredited. A re-examination of the caseordered by the state of Texas in 2009 concluded that \"a finding ofarson could not be sustained.\"Rich Glossiphas spent 20 years on death row after being convictedof murder on the testimony of the actual killer, who escaped witha life sentence in return for implicating him. In 2015 he camewithin minutes of execution before it emerged that Oklahoma hadbeen planning to kill him with an illegal combination of drugs.They still plan to go ahead with the execution, perhaps as soon asthis summer, despitenew evidenceexonerating him.I could go on. There are hundreds of similar cases. In Floridaalone, 29 death row prisoners have been exonerated so far.Far from being rare, wrongful murder convictions arevery common.Police are under pressure to solve a crime that has gotten a lotof attention. When they find a suspect, they want to believe he\\'sguilty, and ignore or even destroy evidence suggesting otherwise.District attorneys want to be seen as effective and tough on crime,and in order to win convictions are willing to manipulate witnessesand withhold evidence. Court-appointed defense attorneys areoverworked and often incompetent. There\\'s a ready supply of criminalswilling to give false testimony in return for a lighter sentence,suggestible witnesses who can be made to say whatever police want,and bogus \"experts\" eager to claim that science proves the defendantis guilty. And juries want to believe them, since otherwise someterrible crime remains unsolved.This circus of incompetence and dishonesty is the real issue withthe death penalty. We don\\'t even reach the point where theoreticalquestions about the moral justification or effectiveness of capitalpunishment start to matter, because so many of the people sentencedto death are actually innocent. Whatever it means in theory, inpractice capital punishment means killing innocent people.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'I was thinking recently how inconvenient it was not to have a generalterm for iPhones, iPads, and the corresponding things runningAndroid.  The closest to a general term seems to be \"mobile devices,\"but that (a) applies to any mobile phone, and (b) doesn\\'t reallycapture what\\'s distinctive about the iPad.After a few seconds it struck me that what we\\'ll end up callingthese things is tablets.  The only reason we even consider callingthem \"mobile devices\" is that the iPhone preceded the iPad.  If theiPad had come first, we wouldn\\'t think of the iPhone as a phone;we\\'d think of it as a tablet small enough to hold up to your ear.The iPhone isn\\'t so much a phone as a replacement for a phone.That\\'s an important distinction, because it\\'s an early instance ofwhat will become a common pattern.  Many if not most of thespecial-purpose objects around us are going to be replaced by appsrunning on tablets.This is already clear in cases like GPSes, music players, andcameras.  But I think it will surprise people how many things aregoing to get replaced.  We funded one startup that\\'sreplacing keys.The fact that you can change font sizes easily means the iPadeffectively replaces reading glasses.  I wouldn\\'t be surprised ifby playing some clever tricks with the accelerometer you could evenreplace the bathroom scale.The advantages of doing things in software on a single device areso great that everything that can get turned into software will.So for the next couple years, a goodrecipe for startupswill be to look around you for things that people haven\\'t realizedyet can be made unnecessary by a tablet app.In 1938 Buckminster Fuller coined the termephemeralizationtodescribe the increasing tendency of physical machinery to be replacedby what we would now call software.  The reason tablets are goingto take over the world is not (just) that Steve Jobs and Co areindustrial design wizards, but because they have this force behindthem.  The iPhone and the iPad have effectively drilled a hole thatwill allow ephemeralization to flow into a lot of new areas.  No onewho has studied the history of technology would want to underestimatethe power of that force.I worry about the power Apple could have with this force behindthem.  I don\\'t want to see another era of client monoculture likethe Microsoft one in the 80s and 90s.  But if ephemeralization isone of the main forces driving the spread of tablets, that suggestsa way to compete with Apple: be a better platform for it.It has turned out to be a great thing that Apple tablets haveaccelerometers in them.  Developers have used the accelerometer inways Apple could never have imagined.  That\\'s the nature of platforms.The more versatile the tool, the less you can predict how peoplewill use it.  So tablet makers should be thinking: what else canwe put in there?  Not merely hardware, but software too.  What elsecan we give developers access to?  Give hackers an inch and they\\'lltake you a mile.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'All the besthackersI know are gradually switching to Macs.  Myfriend Robert said his whole research group at MIT recently boughtthemselves Powerbooks.  These guys are not the graphic designersand grandmas who were buying Macs at Apple\\'s low point in themid 1990s.  They\\'re about as hardcore OS hackers as you can get.The reason, of course, is OS X.  Powerbooks are beautifully designedand run FreeBSD.  What more do you need to know?I got a Powerbook at the end of last year.   When my IBM Thinkpad\\'shard disk died soon after, it became my only laptop.  And when myfriend Trevor showed up at my house recently, he was carrying aPowerbookidenticalto mine.For most of us, it\\'s not a switch to Apple, but a return.  Hard asthis was to believe in the mid 90s, the Mac was in its time thecanonical hacker\\'s computer.In the fall of 1983,the professor in one of my college CS classes got up and announced,like a prophet, that there would soon be a computer with half a MIPSof processing power that would fit under an airline seat and costso little that we could save enough to buy one from a summer job.The whole room gasped.And when the Mac appeared, it was even better than we\\'d hoped.  Itwas small and powerful and cheap, as promised.  But it was alsosomething we\\'d never considered a computer could be: fabulouslywelldesigned.I had to have one.  And I wasn\\'t alone.  In the mid to late 1980s,all the hackers I knew were either writing software for the Mac,or wanted to.  Every futon sofa in Cambridge seemed to have thesame fat white book lying open on it.  If you turned it over, itsaid \"Inside Macintosh.\"Then came Linux and FreeBSD, and hackers, who follow the mostpowerful OS wherever it leads, found themselves switching to Intelboxes.  If you cared about design, you could buy a Thinkpad, whichwas at least not actively repellent, if you could get the Intel andMicrosoftstickersoff the front. [1]With OS X, the hackers are back.  When I walked into the Apple storein Cambridge, it was like coming home.  Muchwas changed, but there was still that Apple coolness in the air,that feeling that the show was being run by someone who reallycared, instead of random corporate deal-makers.So what, the business world may say. Who cares if hackers like Appleagain?  How big is the hacker market, after all?Quite small, but important out of proportion to its size.  When itcomes to computers, what hackers are doing now, everyone will bedoing in ten years.  Almost all technology, from Unix to bitmappeddisplays to the Web, became popular first within CS departments andresearch labs, and gradually spread to the rest of the world.I remember telling my father back in 1986 that there was a new kindof computer called a Sun that was a serious Unix machine, butso small and cheap that you couldhave one of your own to sit in front of, instead of sitting in frontof a VT100 connected to a single central Vax.  Maybe, I suggested,he should buy some stock in this company.  I think he really wisheshe\\'d listened.In 1994 my friend Koling wanted to talk to his girlfriend in Taiwan,and to save long-distance bills he wrote some software that would  convert sound to data packets that could be sent over the Internet.We weren\\'t sure at the time whether this was a proper use of the Internet, which was still then a quasi-government entity.  What hewas doing is now called VoIP, and it is a huge and rapidly growingbusiness.If you want to know what ordinary people will be doing with computersin ten years, just walk around the CS department at a good university.Whatever they\\'re doing, you\\'ll be doing.In the matter of \"platforms\" this tendency is even more pronounced,because novel software originates withgreat hackers, and they tendto write it first for whatever computer they personally use.  Andsoftware sells hardware.  Many if not most of the initial sales ofthe Apple II came from people who bought one to run VisiCalc.  Andwhy did Bricklin and Frankston write VisiCalc for the Apple II?Because they personally liked it.  They could have chosen any machineto make into a star.If you want to attract hackers to write software that will sellyour hardware, you have to make it something that they themselvesuse.  It\\'s not enough to make it \"open.\"  It has to be open andgood.And open and good is what Macs are again, finally.  The interveningyears have created a situation that is, as far as I know, withoutprecedent: Apple is popular at the low end and the high end, butnot in the middle.  My seventy year old mother has a Mac laptop.My friends with PhDs in computer science have Mac laptops. [2] And yet Apple\\'s overall market share is still small.Though unprecedented, I predict this situation is also temporary.So Dad, there\\'s this company called Apple. They make a new kind ofcomputer that\\'s as well designed as a Bang & Olufsen stereo system,and underneath is the best Unix machine you can buy.  Yes, the priceto earnings ratio is kind of high, but I think a lot of people aregoing to want these.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.October 2006(This essay is derived from a talk at MIT.)Till recently graduating seniors had two choices: get a job or goto grad school.  I think there will increasingly be a third option:to start your own startup.  But how common will that be?I\\'m sure the default will always be to get a job, but starting astartup could well become as popular as grad school.  In the late90s my professor friends used to complain that they couldn\\'t getgrad students, because all the undergrads were going to work forstartups.  I wouldn\\'t be surprised if that situation returns, butwith one difference: this time they\\'ll be starting their owninstead of going to work for other people\\'s.The most ambitious students will at this point be asking: Why waittill you graduate?  Why not start a startup while you\\'re in college?In fact, why go to college at all?  Why not start a startup instead?A year and a half ago I gave atalkwhere I said that the average age of the founders ofYahoo, Google, and Microsoft was 24, and that if grad students couldstart startups, why not undergrads?  I\\'m glad I phrased that as aquestion, because now I can pretend it wasn\\'t merely a rhetoricalone.  At the time I couldn\\'t imagine why there should be any lowerlimit for the age of startup founders.  Graduation is a bureaucraticchange, not a biological one.  And certainly there are undergradsas competent technically as most grad students.  So why shouldn\\'tundergrads be able to start startups as well as grad students?I now realize that something does change at graduation: you lose ahuge excuse for failing.  Regardless of how complex your life is,you\\'ll find that everyone else, including your family and friends,will discard all the low bits and regard you as having a singleoccupation at any given time.  If you\\'re in college and have asummer job writing software, you still read as a student.  Whereasif you graduate and get a job programming, you\\'ll be instantlyregarded by everyone as a programmer.The problem with starting a startup while you\\'re still in schoolis that there\\'s a built-in escape hatch.  If you start a startupin the summer between your junior and senior year, it reads toeveryone as a summer job.So if it goes nowhere, big deal; you return to school in thefall with all the other seniors; no one regards you as a failure,because your occupation is student, and you didn\\'t fail at that.Whereas if you start a startup just one year later, after yougraduate, as long as you\\'re not accepted to grad school in the fallthe startup reads to everyone as your occupation.  You\\'renow a startup founder, so you have to do well at that.For nearly everyone, the opinion of one\\'s peers is the most powerfulmotivator of all—more powerful even than the nominal goal of moststartup founders, getting rich.About a month into each fundingcycle we have an event called Prototype Day where each startuppresents to the others what they\\'ve got so far.  You might thinkthey wouldn\\'t need any more motivation.  They\\'re working on theircool new idea; they have funding for the immediate future; andthey\\'re playing a game with only two outcomes: wealth or failure.You\\'d think that would be motivation enough.  And yet the prospectof a demo pushes most of them into arush of activity.Even if you start a startup explicitly to get rich, the money youmight get seems pretty theoretical most of the time.  What drivesyou day to day is not wanting to look bad.You probably can\\'t change that.  Even if you could, I don\\'t thinkyou\\'d want to; someone who really, truly doesn\\'t care what his peersthink of him is probably a psychopath.  So the best you can do isconsider this force like a wind, and set up your boat accordingly.If you know your peers are going to push you in some direction,choose good peers, and position yourself so they push you in adirection you like.Graduation changes the prevailing winds, and those make a difference.Starting a startup is so hardthat it\\'s a close call even for the ones that succeed.  Howeverhigh a startup may be flying now, it probably has a few leaves stuckin the landing gear from those trees it barely cleared at the endof the runway.  In such a close game, the smallest increase in theforces against you can be enough to flick you over the edge intofailure.When we first startedY Combinatorwe encouraged people to startstartups while they were still in college.  That\\'s partly becauseY Combinator began as a kind of summer program.  We\\'ve kept theprogram shape—all of us having dinner together once a week turnsout to be a good idea—but we\\'ve decided nowthat the party line should be to tell people to wait till theygraduate.Does that mean you can\\'t start a startup in college?  Not at all.Sam Altman, the co-founder ofLoopt,had just finished his sophomore year when we funded them, and Looptis probably the most promising of all the startups we\\'ve funded sofar.  But Sam Altman is a very unusual guy.  Within about threeminutes of meeting him, I remember thinking \"Ah, so this is whatBill Gates must have been like when he was 19.\"If it can work to start a startup during college, why dowe tell people not to?  For the same reason that the probablyapocryphal violinist, whenever he was asked to judge someone\\'splaying, would always say they didn\\'t have enough talent to makeit as a pro.  Succeeding as a musician takes determination as wellas talent, so this answer works out to be the right advice foreveryone.  The ones who are uncertain believe it and give up, andthe ones who are sufficiently determined think \"screw that, I\\'llsucceed anyway.\"So our official policy now is only to fund undergrads we can\\'t talkout of it.  And frankly, if you\\'re not certain, youshouldwait.It\\'s not as if all the opportunities to start companies are goingto be gone if you don\\'t do it now.  Maybe the window will close onsome idea you\\'re working on, but that won\\'t be the last idea you\\'llhave.  For every idea that times out, new ones become feasible.Historically the opportunities to start startups have only increasedwith time.In that case, you might ask, why not wait longer?  Why not go workfor a while, or go to grad school, and then start a startup?  Andindeed, that might be a good idea.  If I had to pick the sweet spotfor startup founders, based on who we\\'re most excited to seeapplications from, I\\'d say it\\'s probably the mid-twenties.  Why?What advantages does someone in their mid-twenties have over someonewho\\'s 21?  And why isn\\'t it older?  What can 25 year olds do that32 year olds can\\'t?  Those turn out to be questions worth examining.PlusIf you start a startup soon after college, you\\'ll be a young founderby present standards, so you should know what the relative advantagesof young founders are.  They\\'re not what you might think.  As ayoung founder your strengths are: stamina, poverty, rootlessness,colleagues, and ignorance.The importance of stamina shouldn\\'t be surprising.  If you\\'ve heardanything about startups you\\'ve probably heard about the long hours.As far as I can tell these are universal.  I can\\'t think of anysuccessful startups whose founders worked 9 to 5.  And it\\'sparticularly necessary for younger founders to work long hoursbecause they\\'re probably not as efficient as they\\'ll be later.Your second advantage, poverty, might not sound like an advantage,but it is a huge one.  Poverty implies you can live cheaply,and this is critically important for startups.  Nearly every startupthat fails, fails by running out of money.  It\\'s a little misleadingto put it this way, because there\\'s usually some other underlyingcause.  But regardless of the source of your problems, a low burnrate gives you more opportunity to recover from them.  And sincemost startups make all kinds of mistakes at first, room to recoverfrom mistakes is a valuable thing to have.Most startups end up doing something different than they planned.The way the successful ones find something that works is by tryingthings that don\\'t.  So the worst thing you can do in a startup isto have a rigid, pre-ordained plan and then start spending a lotof money to implement it.  Better to operate cheaply and give yourideas time to evolve.Recent grads can live on practically nothing, and this gives youan edge over older founders, because the main cost in softwarestartups is people.  The guys with kids and mortgages are at areal disadvantage.  This is one reason I\\'d bet on the 25 year oldover the 32 year old.  The 32 year old probably is a better programmer,but probably also has a much more expensive life.  Whereas a 25year old has some work experience (more on that later) but can liveas cheaply as an undergrad.Robert Morris and I were 29 and 30 respectively when we startedViaweb, but fortunately we still lived like 23 year olds.  We both hadroughly zero assets.  I would have loved to have a mortgage,since that would have meant I had ahouse.  But in retrospecthaving nothing turned out to be convenient. I wasn\\'t tied down andI was used to living cheaply.Even more important than living cheaply, though, is thinking cheaply.One reason the Apple II was so popular was that it was cheap.  Thecomputer itself was cheap, and it used cheap, off-the-shelf peripheralslike a cassette tape recorder for data storage and a TV as a monitor.And you know why?  Because Woz designed this computer for himself,and he couldn\\'t afford anything more.We benefitted from the same phenomenon.  Our prices weredaringly low for the time.  The top level of service was$300 a month, which was an order of magnitude below the norm.  Inretrospect this was a smart move, but we didn\\'t do it because wewere smart.  $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.  LikeApple, we created something inexpensive, and therefore popular,simply because we were poor.A lot of startups have that form: someone comes along and makessomething for a tenth or a hundredth of what it used to cost, andthe existing players can\\'t follow because they don\\'t even want tothink about a world in which that\\'s possible.  Traditional longdistance carriers, for example, didn\\'t even want to think aboutVoIP.  (It was coming, all the same.)  Being poor helps in thisgame, because your own personal bias points in the same directiontechnology evolves in.The advantages of rootlessness are similar to those of poverty.When you\\'re young you\\'re more mobile—not just because you don\\'thave a house or much stuff, but also because you\\'re less likely tohave serious relationships.  This turns out to be important, becausea lot of startups involve someone moving.The founders of Kiko, for example, are now en route to the Bay Areato start their next startup.  It\\'s a better place for what theywant to do.  And it was easy for them to decide to go, becauseneither as far as I know has a serious girlfriend, and everythingthey own will fit in one car—or more precisely, will either fitin one car or is crappy enough that they don\\'t mind leaving itbehind.They at least were in Boston.  What if they\\'d been in Nebraska,like Evan Williams was at their age?   Someone wrote recently thatthe drawback of Y Combinator was that you had to move to participate.It couldn\\'t be any other way. The kind of conversations we havewith founders, we have to have in person.  We fund a dozen startupsat a time, and we can\\'t be in a dozen places at once.  But even ifwe could somehow magically save people from moving, we wouldn\\'t.We wouldn\\'t be doing founders a favor by letting them stay inNebraska.  Places that aren\\'tstartup hubsare toxic to startups.You can tell that from indirect evidence.  You can tell how hardit must be to start a startup in Houston or Chicago or Miami fromthe microscopically small number, per capita, that succeed there.  I don\\'t know exactly what\\'s suppressing all the startups in thesetowns—probably a hundred subtle little things—but somethingmust be.Maybe this will change.  Maybe the increasing cheapness of startupswill mean they\\'ll be able to survive anywhere, instead of only inthe most hospitable environments.  Maybe 37signals is the patternfor the future.  But maybe not.  Historically there have alwaysbeen certain towns that were centers for certain industries, andif you weren\\'t in one of them you were at a disadvantage.  So myguess is that 37signals is an anomaly.  We\\'re looking at a patternmuch older than \"Web 2.0\" here.Perhaps the reason more startups per capita happen in the Bay Areathan Miami is simply that there are more founder-type people there.Successful startups are almost never started by one person.  Usuallythey begin with a conversation in which someone mentions thatsomething would be a good idea for a company, and his friend says,\"Yeah, that is a good idea, let\\'s try it.\"  If you\\'re missing thatsecond person who says \"let\\'s try it,\" the startup never happens.And that is another area where undergrads have an edge.  They\\'resurrounded by people willing to say that.  At a good college you\\'reconcentrated together with a lot of other ambitious and technicallyminded people—probably more concentrated than you\\'ll ever beagain.  If your nucleus spits out a neutron, there\\'s a good chanceit will hit another nucleus.The number one question people ask us at Y Combinator is: Where canI find a co-founder?  That\\'s the biggest problem for someone startinga startup at 30.  When they were in school they knew a lot of goodco-founders, but by 30 they\\'ve either lost touch with them or thesepeople are tied down by jobs they don\\'t want to leave.Viaweb was an anomaly in this respect too.  Though we were comparativelyold, we weren\\'t tied down by impressive jobs.  I was trying to bean artist, which is not very constraining, and Robert, though 29,was still in grad school due to a little interruption in his academiccareer back in 1988.  So arguably the Worm made Viaweb possible.Otherwise Robert would have been a junior professor at that age,and he wouldn\\'t have had time to work on crazy speculative projectswith me.Most of the questions people ask Y Combinator we have some kind ofanswer for, but not the co-founder question.  There is no goodanswer.  Co-founders really should be people you already know.  Andby far the best place to meet them is school. You have a largesample of smart people; you get to compare how they all perform onidentical tasks; and everyone\\'s life is pretty fluid.  A lot ofstartups grow out of schools for this reason.  Google, Yahoo, andMicrosoft, among others, were all founded by people who met inschool.  (In Microsoft\\'s case, it was high school.)Many students feel they should wait and get a little more experiencebefore they start a company.  All other things being equal, theyshould.  But all other things are not quite as equal as they look.Most students don\\'t realize how rich they are in the scarcestingredient in startups, co-founders.  If you wait too long, you mayfind that your friends are now involved in some project they don\\'twant to abandon.  The better they are, the more likely this is tohappen.One way to mitigate this problem might be to actively plan yourstartup while you\\'re getting those n years of experience.  Sure,go off and get jobs or go to grad school or whatever, but gettogether regularly to scheme, so the idea of starting a startupstays alive in everyone\\'s brain.  I don\\'t know if this works, butit can\\'t hurt to try.It would be helpful just to realize what an advantage you have asstudents.  Some of your classmates are probably going to be successfulstartup founders; at a great technical university, that is a nearcertainty.  So which ones?  If I were you I\\'d look for the peoplewho are not just smart, but incurablebuilders.Lookfor the people who keep starting projects, and finish at least someof them.  That\\'s what we look for.  Above all else, above academiccredentials and even the idea you apply with, we look for peoplewho build things.The other place co-founders meet is at work.  Fewer do than atschool, but there are things you can do to improve the odds.  Themost important, obviously, is to work somewhere that has a lot ofsmart, young people.  Another is to work for a company located ina startup hub.  It will be easier to talk a co-worker into quittingwith you in a place where startups are happening all around you.You might also want to look at the employment agreement you signwhen you get hired.  Most will say that any ideas you think of whileyou\\'re employed by the company belong to them.  In practice it\\'shard for anyone to prove what ideas you had when, so the line getsdrawn at code.  If you\\'re going to start a startup, don\\'t write anyof the code while you\\'re still employed.  Or at least discard anycode you wrote while still employed and start over.  It\\'s not somuch that your employer will find out and sue you.  It won\\'t cometo that; investors or acquirers or (if you\\'re so lucky) underwriterswill nail you first.  Between t = 0 and when you buy that yacht,someoneis going to ask if any of your code legally belongsto anyone else, and you need to be able to say no.The most overreaching employee agreement I\\'ve seen so far is Amazon\\'s.In addition to the usual clauses about owning your ideas, you alsocan\\'t be a founder of a startup that has another founder who workedat Amazon—even if you didn\\'t know them or even work there at thesame time. I suspect they\\'d have a hard time enforcing this, butit\\'s a bad sign they even try.  There are plenty of other placesto work; you may as well choose one that keeps more of your optionsopen.Speaking of cool places to work, there is of course Google.  But Inotice something slightly frightening about Google: zero startupscome out of there.  In that respect it\\'s a black hole.  People seemto like working at Google too much to leave.  So if you hope to starta startup one day, the evidence so far suggests you shouldn\\'t workthere.I realize this seems odd advice.  If they make your life so goodthat you don\\'t want to leave, why not work there?  Because, ineffect, you\\'re probably getting a local maximum.  You need a certainactivation energy to start a startup.  So an employer who\\'s fairlypleasant to work for can lull you into staying indefinitely, evenif it would be a net win for you to leave.The best place to work, if you want to start a startup, is probablya startup.  In addition to being the right sort of experience, oneway or another it will be over quickly.  You\\'ll either end up rich,in which case problem solved, or the startup will get bought, inwhich case it it will start to suck to work there and it will beeasy to leave, or most likely, the thing will blow up and you\\'llbe free again.Your final advantage, ignorance, may not sound very useful.  Ideliberately used a controversial word for it; you might equallycall it innocence.  But it seems to be a powerful force.  My YCombinator co-founder Jessica Livingston is just about to publisha book ofinterviewswith startup founders, and I noticed a remarkable pattern in them.One after another said that if they\\'d known how hard it would be,they would have been too intimidated to start.Ignorance can be useful when it\\'s a counterweight to other formsof stupidity.  It\\'s useful in starting startups because you\\'recapable of more than you realize.  Starting startups is harder thanyou expect, but you\\'re also capable of more than you expect, sothey balance out.Most people look at a company like Apple and think, how could Iever make such a thing?  Apple is an institution, and I\\'m just aperson.  But every institution was at one point just a handful ofpeople in a room deciding to start something.  Institutions aremade up, and made up by people no different from you.I\\'m not saying everyone could start a startup.  I\\'m sure most peoplecouldn\\'t; I don\\'t know much about the population at large.  Whenyou get to groups I know well, like hackers, I can say more precisely.At the top schools, I\\'d guess as many as a quarter of the CS majorscould make it as startup founders if they wanted.That \"if they wanted\" is an important qualification—so importantthat it\\'s almost cheating to append it like that—because once youget over a certain threshold of intelligence, which most CS majorsat top schools are past, the deciding factor in whether you succeedas a founder is how much you want to.  You don\\'t have to be thatsmart.  If you\\'re not a genius, just start a startup in some unsexyfield where you\\'ll have less competition, like software for humanresources departments.  I picked that example at random, but I feelsafe in predicting that whatever they have now, it wouldn\\'t takegenius to do better.   There are a lot of people out there workingon boring stuff who are desperately in need of better software, sohowever short you think you fall of Larry and Sergey, you can ratchetdown the coolness of the idea far enough to compensate.As well as preventing you from being intimidated, ignorance cansometimes help you discover new ideas.Steve Wozniakput this very strongly:All the best things that I did at Apple came from (a) not having  money and (b) not having done it before, ever. Every single thing  that we came out with that was really great, I\\'d never once done  that thing in my life.When you know nothing, you have to reinvent stuff for yourself, andif you\\'re smart your reinventions may be better than what precededthem.  This is especially true in fields where the rules change.All our ideas about software were developed in a time when processorswere slow, and memories and disks were tiny.  Who knows what obsoleteassumptions are embedded in the conventional wisdom?  And the waythese assumptions are going to get fixed is not by explicitlydeallocating them, but by something more akin to garbage collection.Someone ignorant but smart will come along and reinvent everything,and in the process simply fail to reproduce certain existing ideas.MinusSo much for the advantages of young founders.  What about thedisadvantages? I\\'m going to start with what goes wrong and try totrace it back to the root causes.What goes wrong with young founders is that they build stuff thatlooks like class projects.  It was only recently that we figuredthis out ourselves.  We noticed a lot of similarities between thestartups that seemed to be falling behind, but we couldn\\'t figureout how to put it into words.  Then finally we realized what itwas: they were building class projects.But what does that really mean?  What\\'s wrong with class projects?What\\'s the difference between a class project and a real startup?If we could answer that question it would be useful not just towould-be startup founders but to students in general, because we\\'dbe a long way toward explaining the mystery of the so-called realworld.There seem to be two big things missing in class projects: (1) aniterative definition of a real problem and (2) intensity.The first is probably unavoidable.  Class projects will inevitablysolve fake problems.  For one thing, real problems are rare andvaluable.  If a professor wanted to have students solve real problems,he\\'d face the same paradox as someone trying to give an example ofwhatever \"paradigm\" might succeed the Standard Model of physics.There may well be something that does, but if you could think ofan example you\\'d be entitled to the Nobel Prize.  Similarly, goodnew problems are not to be had for the asking.In technology the difficulty is compounded by the fact that realstartups tend to discover the problem they\\'re solving by a processof evolution.  Someone has an idea for something; they build it;and in doing so (and probably only by doing so) they realizethe problem they should be solving is another one.  Even if theprofessor let you change your project description on the fly, thereisn\\'t time enough to do that in a college class, or a market tosupply evolutionary pressures.  So classprojects are mostly about implementation, which is the leastof your problems in a startup.It\\'s not just that in a startup you work on the idea as well asimplementation.  The very implementation is different.  Its mainpurpose is to refine the idea.  Often the only value of most of thestuff you build in the first six months is that it proves yourinitial idea was mistaken.  And that\\'s extremely valuable.  Ifyou\\'re free of a misconception that everyone else still shares,you\\'re in a powerful position.  But you\\'re not thinking that wayabout a class project.  Proving your initial plan was mistaken wouldjust get you a bad grade.  Instead of building stuff to throw away,you tend to want every line of code to go toward that final goalof showing you did a lot of work.That leads to our second difference: the way class projects aremeasured.  Professors will tend to judge you by the distance betweenthe starting point and where you are now.  If someone has achieveda lot, they should get a good grade.  But customers will judge youfrom the other direction: the distance remaining between where youare now and the features they need.  The market doesn\\'t give a shithow hard you worked.  Users just want your software to do what theyneed, and you get a zero otherwise.  That is one of the mostdistinctive differences between school and the real world: thereis no reward for putting in a good effort.  In fact, the wholeconcept of a \"good effort\" is a fake idea adults invented to encouragekids.  It is not found in nature.Such lies seem to be helpful to kids.  But unfortunately when yougraduate they don\\'t give you a list of all the lies they told youduring your education.  You have to get them beaten out of you bycontact with the real world.  And this is why so many jobs wantwork experience.  I couldn\\'t understand that when I was in college.I knew how to program.  In fact, I could tell I knew how to programbetter than most people doing it for a living.  So what was thismysterious \"work experience\" and why did I need it?Now I know what it is, and part of the confusion is grammatical.Describing it as \"work experience\" implies it\\'s like experienceoperating a certain kind of machine, or using a certain programminglanguage.  But really what work experience refers to is not somespecific expertise, but the elimination of certain habits left overfrom childhood.One of the defining qualities of kids is that they flake.  Whenyou\\'re a kid and you face some hard test, you can cry and say \"Ican\\'t\" and they won\\'t make you do it.  Of course, no one can makeyou do anything in the grownup world either.  What they do insteadis fire you.  And when motivated by thatyou find you can do a lot more than you realized.  So one of thethings employers expect from someone with \"work experience\" is theelimination of the flake reflex—the ability to get things done,with no excuses.The other thing you get from work experience is an understandingof what work is, and in particular, how intrinsically horrible itis.  Fundamentally the equation is a brutal one: you have to spendmost of your waking hours doing stuff someone else wants, or starve.There are a few places where the work is so interesting that thisis concealed, because what other people want done happens to coincidewith what you want to work on.  But you only have to imagine whatwould happen if they diverged to see the underlying reality.It\\'s not so much that adults lie to kids about this as never explainit.  They never explain what the deal is with money.  You know froman early age that you\\'ll have some sort of job, because everyoneasks what you\\'re going to \"be\" when you grow up. What theydon\\'t tell you is that as a kid you\\'re sitting on the shoulders ofsomeone else who\\'s treading water, and that starting working meansyou get thrown into the water on your own, and have to start treadingwater yourself or sink.  \"Being\" something is incidental; theimmediate problem is not to drown.The relationship between work and money tends to dawn on you onlygradually.  At least it did for me.  One\\'s first thought tends tobe simply \"This sucks.  I\\'m in debt. Plus I have to get up on mondayand go to work.\"  Gradually you realize that these two things areas tightly connected as only a market can make them.So the most important advantage 24 year old founders have over 20year old founders is that they know what they\\'re trying to avoid.To the average undergrad the idea of getting rich translates intobuying Ferraris, or being admired.  To someone who has learned fromexperience about the relationship between money and work, ittranslates to something way more important: it means you get to optout of the brutal equation that governs the lives of 99.9% of people.Getting rich means you can stop treading water.Someone who gets this will work much harder at making a startupsucceed—with the proverbial energy of a drowning man, in fact.But understanding the relationship between money and work alsochanges the way you work.  You don\\'t get money just for working,but for doing things other people want.  Someone who\\'s figured thatout will automatically focus more on the user.  And that cures theother half of the class-project syndrome.  After you\\'ve been workingfor a while, you yourself tend to measure what you\\'ve done the sameway the market does.Of course, you don\\'t have to spend years working to learn thisstuff.  If you\\'re sufficiently perceptive you can grasp these thingswhile you\\'re still in school.  Sam Altman did.  He must have, becauseLoopt is no class project.  And as his example suggests, this canbe valuable knowledge.  At a minimum, if you get this stuff, youalready have most of what you gain from the \"work experience\"employers consider so desirable.  But of course if you really getit, you can use this information in a way that\\'s more valuable toyou than that.NowSo suppose you think you might start a startup at some point, eitherwhen you graduate or a few years after.  What should you do now?For both jobs and grad school, there are ways to prepare whileyou\\'re in college.  If you want to get a job when you graduate, youshould get summer jobs at places you\\'d like to work.  If you wantto go to grad school, it will help to work on research projects asan undergrad.  What\\'s the equivalent for startups?  How do you keepyour options maximally open?One thing you can do while you\\'re still in school is to learn howstartups work.  Unfortunately that\\'s not easy.  Few if any collegeshave classes about startups.  There may be business school classeson entrepreneurship, as they call it over there, but these arelikely to be a waste of time.  Business schools like to talk aboutstartups, but philosophically they\\'re at the opposite end of thespectrum.  Most books on startups also seem to be useless.  I\\'velooked at a few and none get it right.  Books in most fields arewritten by people who know the subject from experience, but forstartups there\\'s a unique problem:  by definition the founders ofsuccessful startups don\\'t need to write books to make money. As aresult most books on the subject end up being written by people whodon\\'t understand it.So I\\'d be skeptical of classes and books.  The way to learn aboutstartups is by watching them in action, preferably by working atone.  How do you do that as an undergrad?  Probably by sneaking inthrough the back door. Just hang around a lot and gradually startdoing things for them.  Most startups are (or should be) verycautious about hiring.  Every hire increases the burn rate, and badhires early on are hard to recover from.  However, startups usuallyhave a fairly informal atmosphere, and there\\'s always a lot thatneeds to be done.  If you just start doing stuff for them, manywill be too busy to shoo you away.  You can thus gradually workyour way into their confidence, and maybe turn it into an officialjob later, or not, whichever you prefer.  This won\\'t work for allstartups, but it would work for most I\\'ve known.Number two, make the most of the great advantage of school: thewealth of co-founders.  Look at the people around you and askyourself which you\\'d like to work with.  When you apply that test,you may find you get surprising results.  You may find you\\'d preferthe quiet guy you\\'ve mostly ignored to someone who seems impressivebut has an attitude to match.  I\\'m not suggesting you suck up topeople you don\\'t really like because you think one day they\\'ll besuccessful.  Exactly the opposite, in fact: you should only starta startup with someone you like, because a startup will put yourfriendship through a stress test.  I\\'m just saying you should thinkabout who you really admire and hang out with them, instead ofwhoever circumstances throw you together with.Another thing you can do is learn skills that will be useful to youin a startup.  These may be different from the skills you\\'d learnto get a job.  For example, thinking about getting a job will makeyou want to learn programming languages you think employers want,like Java and C++.  Whereas if you start a startup, you get to pickthe language, so you have to think about which will actually letyou get the most done.  If you use that test you might end uplearning Ruby or Python instead.But the most important skill for a startup founder isn\\'t a programmingtechnique.  It\\'s a knack for understanding users and figuring outhow to give them what they want.  I know I repeat this, but that\\'sbecause it\\'s so important.  And it\\'s a skill you can learn, thoughperhaps habit might be a better word.  Get into the habit of thinkingof software as having users.  What do those users want?  What wouldmake them say wow?This is particularly valuable for undergrads, because the conceptof users is missing from most college programming classes.  The wayyou get taught programming in college would be like teaching writingas grammar, without mentioning that its purpose is to communicatesomething to an audience.  Fortunately an audience for software isnow only an http request away.  So in addition to the programmingyou do for your classes, why not build some kind of website peoplewill find useful?  At the very least it will teach you how to writesoftware with users.  In the best case, it might not just bepreparation for a startup, but the startup itself, like it was forYahoo and Google.'},\n",

       "  'date': 'September 2009',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'I bet you the current issue ofCosmopolitanhas an articlewhose title begins with a number. \"7 Things He Won\\'t Tell You aboutSex,\" or something like that.  Some popular magazinesfeature articles of this type on the cover of everyissue.  That can\\'t be happening by accident.  Editors must knowthey attract readers.Why do readers like the list of n things so much?   Mainly becauseit\\'s easier to read than a regular article.Structurally, the list of n things is a degenerate case of essay.An essay can go anywhere the writer wants.  In a list of n thingsthe writer agrees to constrain himself to a collection of pointsof roughly equal importance, and he tells the reader explicitlywhat they are.Some of the work of reading an article is understanding itsstructure—figuring out what in high school we\\'d have calledits \"outline.\" Not explicitly, of course, but someone who reallyunderstands an article probably has something in his brain afterwardthat corresponds to such an outline.  In a list of n things, thiswork is done for you.  Its structure is an exoskeleton.As well as being explicit, the structure is guaranteed to be of thesimplest possible type: a few main points with few to no subordinateones, and no particular connection between them.Because the main points are unconnected, the list of n things israndom access.  There\\'s no thread of reasoning you have to follow.  You couldread the list in any order.  And because the points are independentof one another, they work like watertight compartments in anunsinkable ship.  If you get bored with, or can\\'t understand, ordon\\'t agree with one point, you don\\'t have to give up on the article.You can just abandon that one and skip to the next.  A list of nthings is parallel and therefore fault tolerant.There are times when this format is what a writer wants.  One, obviously,is when what you have to say actually is a list of nthings.  I once wrote an essay about themistakes that kill startups, and a few people made fun of mefor writing something whose title began with a number.  But in thatcase I really was trying to make a complete catalog of a number ofindependent things.  In fact, one of the questions I was trying toanswer was how many there were.There are other less legitimate reasons for using this format.  Forexample, I use it when I get close to a deadline.  If I have togive a talk and I haven\\'t started it a few days beforehand, I\\'llsometimes play it safe and make the talk a list of n things.The list of n things is easier for writers as well as readers.  Whenyou\\'re writing a real essay, there\\'s always a chance you\\'ll hit adead end.  A real essay is a train of thought, and some trains ofthought just peter out.  That\\'s an alarming possibility when youhave to give a talk in a few days.  What if you run out of ideas?The compartmentalized structure of the list of n things protectsthe writer from his own stupidity in much the same way it protectsthe reader.  If you run out of ideas on one point, no problem: itwon\\'t kill the essay.  You can take out the whole point if you needto, and the essay will still survive.Writing a list of n things is so relaxing.  You think of n/2 ofthem in the first 5 minutes.  So bang, there\\'s the structure, andyou just have to fill it in.  As you think of more points, you justadd them to the end.  Maybe you take out or rearrange or combine afew, but at every stage you have a valid (though initially low-res)list of n things.  It\\'s like the sort of programming where you writea version 1 very quickly and then gradually modify it, but at everypoint have working code—or the style of painting where you beginwith a complete but very blurry sketch done in an hour, then spenda week cranking up the resolution.Because the list of n things is easier for writers too, it\\'s notalways a damning sign when readers prefer it.  It\\'s not necessarilyevidence readers are lazy; it could also mean they don\\'t havemuch confidence in the writer.  The list of n things is in thatrespect the cheeseburger of essay forms.  If you\\'re eating at arestaurant you suspect is bad, your best bet is to order thecheeseburger.  Even a bad cook can make a decent cheeseburger.  Andthere are pretty strict conventions about what a cheeseburger shouldlook like.  You can assume the cook isn\\'t going to try somethingweird and artistic.  The list of n things similarly limits thedamage that can be done by a bad writer.  You know it\\'s going tobe about whatever the title says, and the format prevents the writerfrom indulging in any flights of fancy.Because the list of n things is the easiest essay form, it shouldbe a good one for beginning writers.  And in fact it is what mostbeginning writers are taught.  The classic 5 paragraph essay isreally a list of n things for n = 3.  But the students writing themdon\\'t realize they\\'re using the same structure as the articles theyread inCosmopolitan. They\\'re not allowed to include the numbers,and they\\'re expected to spackle over the gaps with gratuitoustransitions (\"Furthermore...\") and cap the thing at either end withintroductory and concluding paragraphs so it will look superficiallylike a real essay.It seems a fine plan to start students off with the list of n things.It\\'s the easiest form.  But if we\\'re going to do that, why not doit openly?  Let them write lists of n things like the pros, withnumbers and no transitions or \"conclusion.\"There is one case where the list of n things is a dishonest format:when you use it to attract attention by falsely claiming the listis an exhaustive one.  I.e. if you write an article that purportsto be aboutthe7 secrets of success.  That kind of title is thesame sort of reflexive challenge as a whodunit. You have to at leastlook at the article to check whether they\\'re the same 7 you\\'d list.Are you overlooking one of the secrets of success?  Better check.It\\'s fine to put \"The\" before the number if you really believeyou\\'ve made an exhaustive list.  But evidence suggests most thingswith titles like this are linkbait.The greatest weakness of the list of n things is that there\\'s solittle room for new thought.  The main point of essay writing, whendone right, is the new ideas you have while doing it.  A real essay,as the name implies, isdynamic: you don\\'t know what you\\'re goingto write when you start.  It will be about whatever you discoverin the course of writing it.This can only happen in a very limited way in a list of n things.You make the title first, and that\\'s what it\\'s going to be about.You can\\'t have more new ideas in the writing than will fit in thewatertight compartments you set up initially.  And your brain seemsto know this: because you don\\'t have room for new ideas, you don\\'thave them.Another advantage of admitting to beginning writers that the 5paragraph essay is really a list of n things is that we can warnthem about this.  It only lets you experience the definingcharacteristic of essay writing on a small scale: in thoughts of asentence or two.  And it\\'s particularly dangerous that the 5 paragraphessay buries the list of n things within something that looks likea more sophisticated type of essay.  If you don\\'t know you\\'re usingthis form, you don\\'t know you need to escape it.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'What Business Can Learn from Open Source',\n",
       "  'date': 'August 2005',\n",
       "  'essay_text': '(This essay is derived from a talk at Oscon 2005.)Lately companies have been paying more attention to open source.Ten years ago there seemed a real danger Microsoft would extend itsmonopoly to servers.  It seems safe to say now that open source hasprevented that.  A recent survey found 52% of companies are replacingWindows servers with Linux servers.More significant, I think, iswhich52% they are.  At this point,anyone proposing to run Windows on servers should be prepared toexplain what they know about servers that Google, Yahoo, and Amazondon\\'t.But the biggest thing business has to learn from open source is notabout Linux or Firefox, but about the forces that produced them.Ultimately these will affect a lot more than what software you use.We may be able to get a fix on these underlying forces by triangulatingfrom open source and blogging.  As you\\'ve probably noticed, theyhave a lot in common.Like open source, blogging is something people do themselves, forfree, because they enjoy it.  Like open source hackers, bloggerscompete with people working for money, and often win.  The methodof ensuring quality is also the same: Darwinian.  Companies ensurequality through rules to prevent employees from screwing up.  Butyou don\\'t need that when the audience can communicate with oneanother.  People just produce whatever they want; the good stuffspreads, and the bad gets ignored.  And in both cases, feedbackfrom the audience improves the best work.Another thing blogging and open source have in common is the Web.People have always been willing to do great workfor free,  but before the Web it was harder to reach an audienceor collaborate on projects.AmateursI think the most important of the new principles business has to learn isthat people work a lot harder on stuff they like.  Well, that\\'snews to no one.  So how can I claim business has to learn it?  WhenI say business doesn\\'t know this, I mean the structure of businessdoesn\\'t reflect it.Business still reflects an older model, exemplified by the Frenchword for working:travailler.  It has an English cousin, travail,and what it means is torture.This turns out not to be the last word on work, however.As societies get richer, they learn something aboutwork that\\'s a lot like what they learn about diet.  We know now that thehealthiest diet is the one our peasant ancestors were forced toeat because they were poor.  Like rich food, idlenessonly seems desirable when you don\\'t get enough of it.  I think we weredesigned to work, just as we were designed to eat a certain amountof fiber, and we feel bad if we don\\'t.There\\'s a name for people who work for the love of it: amateurs.The word now has such bad connotations that we forget its etymology,though it\\'s staring us in the face.  \"Amateur\" was originally rathera complimentary word.  But the thing to be in the twentieth centurywas professional, which amateurs, by definition, are not.That\\'s why the business world was so surprised by one lesson fromopen source: that people working for love often surpass those workingfor money.   Users don\\'t switch from Explorer to Firefox becausethey want to hack the source.  They switch because it\\'s a betterbrowser.It\\'s not that Microsoft isn\\'t trying.  They know controlling thebrowser is one of the keys to retaining their monopoly.  The problemis the same they face in operating systems: they can\\'t pay peopleenough to build something better than a group of inspired hackerswill build for free.I suspect professionalism was always overrated-- not just in theliteral sense of working for money, but also connotations likeformality and detachment.  Inconceivable as it would have seemedin, say, 1970, I think professionalism was largely a fashion,driven by conditions that happened to exist in the twentieth century.One of the most powerful of those was the existence of \"channels.\" Revealingly,the same term was used for both products and information:  therewere distribution channels, and TV and radio channels.It was the narrowness of such channels that made professionalsseem so superior to amateurs.  There were only a few jobs asprofessional journalists, for example, so competition ensured theaverage journalist was fairly good.  Whereas anyone can expressopinions about current events in a bar.  And so the average personexpressing his opinions in a bar sounds like an idiot compared toa journalist writing about the subject.On the Web, the barrier for publishing your ideas is even lower.You don\\'t have to buy a drink, and they even let kids in.Millions of people are publishing online, and the averagelevel of what they\\'re writing, as you might expect, is not verygood.  This has led some in the media to conclude that blogs don\\'tpresent much of a threat-- that blogs are just a fad.Actually, the fad is the word \"blog,\"  at least the way the printmedia now use it.  What they mean by \"blogger\" is not someone whopublishes in a weblog format, but anyone who publishes online.That\\'s going to become a problem as the Web becomes the defaultmedium for publication.  So I\\'dlike to suggest an alternative word for someone who publishes online.How about \"writer?\"Those in the print media who dismiss the writing online because ofits low average quality are missing an important point: no one readstheaverageblog.  In the old world of channels, it meant somethingto talk about average quality, because that\\'s what you were gettingwhether you liked it or not.But now you can read any writer you want.  So the averagequality of writing online isn\\'t what the print media are competingagainst.  They\\'re competing against the best writing online.  And, like Microsoft, they\\'re losing.I know that from my own experience as a reader.  Though most printpublications are online, I probablyread two or three articles on individual people\\'s sites for everyone I read on the site of a newspaper or magazine.And when I read, say, New York Times stories, I never reachthem through the Times front page.   Most I find through aggregatorslike Google News or Slashdot or Delicious. Aggregators show howmuchbetteryou can do than the channel.  The New York Times front page isa list of articles written by people who work for the New York Times.  Deliciousis a list of articles that are interesting.  And it\\'s only now thatyou can see the two side by side that you notice how little overlap there is.Most articles in the print media are boring.  For example, thepresident notices that a majority of voters now think invading Iraqwas a mistake, so he makes an address to the nation to drum upsupport.  Where is the man bites dog in that?  I didn\\'t hear thespeech, but I could probably tell you exactly what he said.  Aspeech like that is, in the most literal sense, not news: there isnothingnewin it.Nor is there anything new, except the names and places, in most\"news\" about things going wrong.  A child is abducted; there\\'s atornado; a ferry sinks; someone gets bitten by a shark; a smallplane crashes.  And what do you learn about the world from thesestories?  Absolutely nothing.  They\\'re outlying data points; whatmakes them gripping also makes them irrelevant.As in software, when professionals produce such crap, it\\'s notsurprising if amateurs can do better.  Live by the channel, die bythe channel: if you depend on an oligopoly, you sink into bad habitsthat are hard to overcome when you suddenly get competition.WorkplacesAnother thing blogs and open source software have in common is thatthey\\'re often made by people working at home.  That may not seemsurprising.  But it should be.  It\\'s the architectural equivalentof a home-made aircraft shooting down an F-18.  Companies spendmillions to build office buildings for a single purpose: to be aplace to work.  And yet people working in their own homes,which aren\\'t even designed to be workplaces, end upbeing more productive.This proves something a lot of us have suspected.  The averageoffice is a miserable place to get work done.  And a lot of whatmakes offices bad are the very qualities we associate withprofessionalism.  The sterilityof offices is supposed to suggest efficiency.  But suggestingefficiency is a different thing from actually being efficient.The atmosphere of the average workplace is to productivity whatflames painted on the side of a car are to speed.  And it\\'s notjust the way offices look that\\'s bleak.  The way people act is justas bad.Things are different in a startup.  Often as not a startup beginsin an apartment.  Instead of matching beige cubiclesthey have an assortment of furniture they bought used.  They workodd hours, wearing the most casual of clothing.  They look atwhatever they want online without worrying whether it\\'s \"work safe.\"The cheery, bland language of the office is replaced by wicked humor.  Andyou know what?  The company at this stage is probably the mostproductive it\\'s ever going to be.Maybe it\\'s not a coincidence.  Maybe some aspects of professionalismare actually a net lose.To me the most demoralizing aspect of the traditional office isthat you\\'re supposed to be there at certain times.  There are usuallya few people in a company who really have to, but the reason mostemployees work fixed hours is that the company can\\'t measure theirproductivity.The basic idea behind office hours is that if you can\\'t make peoplework, you can at least prevent them from having fun.  If employeeshave to be in the building a certain number of hours a day, and areforbidden to do non-work things while there, then they must beworking.  In theory.  In practice they spend a lot of their timein a no-man\\'s land, where they\\'re neither working nor having fun.If you could measure how much work people did, many companieswouldn\\'t need any fixed workday. You could just say: this is whatyou have to do.  Do it whenever you like, wherever you like.  Ifyour work requires you to talk to other people in the company, thenyou may need to be here a certain amount.  Otherwise we don\\'t care.That may seem utopian, but it\\'s what we told people who came towork for our company.  There were no fixed office hours.  I nevershowed up before 11 in the morning.  But we weren\\'t saying this tobe benevolent.  We were saying: if you work here we expect you toget a lot done.  Don\\'t try to fool us just by being here a lot.The problem with the facetime model is not just that it\\'s demoralizing, butthat the people pretending to work interruptthe ones actually working.  I\\'m convinced the facetime modelis the main reason large organizations have so many meetings.Per capita, large organizations accomplish very little.And yet all those people have to be on site at least eight hours aday.  When so much time goes in one end and so little achievementcomes out the other, something has to give.  And meetings are themain mechanism for taking up the slack.For one year I worked at a regular nine to five job, and I rememberwell the strange, cozy feeling that comes over one during meetings.I was very aware, because of the novelty, that I was being paid forprogramming.  It seemed just amazing, as if there was a machine onmy desk that spat out a dollar bill every two minutes no matterwhat I did.  Even while I was in the bathroom!  But because theimaginary machine was always running, I felt I always ought to beworking. And so meetings felt wonderfully relaxing.  Theycounted as work, just like programming, but they were so much easier.All you had to do was sit and look attentive.Meetings are like an opiate with a network effect.  So is email,on a smaller scale.  And in addition to the direct cost in time,there\\'s the cost in fragmentation-- breaking people\\'s day up intobits too small to be useful.You can see how dependent you\\'ve become on something by removingit suddenly.  So for big companies I propose the following experiment.Set aside one day where meetings are forbidden-- where everyone has tosit at their desk all day and work without interruption onthings they can do without talking to anyone else.Some amount of communication is necessary in most jobs, but I\\'msure many employees could find eight hours worth of stuff they coulddo by themselves.  You could call it \"Work Day.\"The other problem with pretend workis that it often looks better than real work.  When I\\'mwriting or hacking I spend as much time just thinking as I doactually typing.  Half the time I\\'m sitting drinking a cup of tea,or walking around the neighborhood.  This is a critical phase--this is where ideas come from-- and yet I\\'d feel guilty doing thisin most offices, with everyone else looking busy.It\\'s hard to see how bad some practice is till you have somethingto compare it to.  And that\\'s one reason open source, and even bloggingin some cases, are so important.  They show us what real work looks like.We\\'re funding eight new startups at the moment.  A friend askedwhat they were doing for office space, and seemed surprised when Isaid we expected them to work out of whatever apartments they foundto live in.  But we didn\\'t propose that to save money.  We did itbecause we want their software to be good.  Working in crappyinformal spaces is one of the things startups do right withoutrealizing it.  As soon as you get into an office, work and lifestart to drift apart.That is one of the key tenets of professionalism. Work and lifeare supposed to be separate.  But that part, I\\'m convinced, is a mistake.Bottom-UpThe third big lesson we can learn from open source andblogging is that ideas can bubble up from the bottom, instead offlowing down from the top.  Open source and blogging both workbottom-up: people make what they want, and the best stuffprevails.Does this sound familiar?  It\\'s the principle of a market economy.Ironically, though open source and blogs are done for free, thoseworlds resemble market economies, while most companies, for alltheir talk about the value of free markets, are run internally likecommunist states.There are two forces that together steer design: ideas aboutwhat to do next, and the enforcement of quality.  In the channelera, both flowed down from the top.  For example, newspaper editorsassigned stories to reporters, then edited what they wrote.Open source and blogging show us things don\\'t have to work thatway.  Ideas and even the enforcement of quality can flow bottom-up.And in both cases the results are not merely acceptable, but better.For example, open source software is more reliable precisely becauseit\\'s open source; anyone can find mistakes.The same happens with writing.  As we got close to publication, Ifound I was very worried about the essays inHackers& Paintersthat hadn\\'t been online.  Once an essay has had a couple thousandpage views I feel reasonably confident about it.  But these had had literally orders of magnitude less scrutiny.  It felt likereleasing software without testing it.That\\'s what all publishing used to be like.  Ifyou got ten people to read a manuscript, you were lucky.  But I\\'dbecome so used to publishing online that the old method now seemedalarmingly unreliable, like navigating by dead reckoning once you\\'dgotten used to a GPS.The other thing I like about publishing online is that you can writewhat you want and publish when you want.  Earlier this year I wrotesomethingthat seemed suitable for a magazine, soI sent it to an editor I know.As I was waiting to hear back, I found to my surprise that I washoping they\\'d reject it.  Then I could put it online right away.If they accepted it, it wouldn\\'t be read by anyone for months, andin the meantime I\\'d have to fight word-by-word to save it from beingmangled by some twenty five year old copy editor.Many employees wouldliketo build great things for the companiesthey work for, but more often than not management won\\'t let them.How many of us have heard stories of employees going to managementand saying, please let us build this thing to make money for you--and the company saying no?  The most famous example is probably Steve Wozniak,who originally wanted to build microcomputers for his then-employer, HP.And they turned him down.  On the blunderometer, this episode rankswith IBM accepting a non-exclusive license for DOS.  But I think thishappens all the time.  We just don\\'t hear about it usually,because to prove yourself right you have to quitand start your own company, like Wozniak did.StartupsSo these, I think, are the three big lessons open source and blogginghave to teach business: (1) that people work harder on stuff theylike, (2) that the standard office environment is very unproductive,and (3) that bottom-up often works better than top-down.I can imagine managers at this point saying: what is this guy talkingabout?  What good does it do me to know that my programmerswould be more productiveworking at home on their own projects?  I need their asses in hereworking on version 3.2 of our software, or we\\'re never going tomake the release date.And it\\'s true, the benefit that specific manager could derive fromthe forces I\\'ve described is near zero.  When I say business canlearn from open source, I don\\'t mean any specific business can.  Imean business can learn about new conditions the same way a genepool does.  I\\'m not claiming companies can get smarter, just thatdumb ones will die.So what will business look like when it has assimilated the lessonsof open source and blogging?  I think the big obstacle preventingus from seeing the future of business is the assumption that peopleworking for you have to be employees.  But think about what\\'s goingon underneath:  the company has some money, and they pay it to theemployee in the hope that he\\'ll make something worth more than theypaid him.  Well, there are other ways to arrange that relationship.Instead of paying the guy money as a salary, why not give it to himas investment?  Then instead of coming to your office to work onyour projects, he can work wherever he wants on projects of his own.Because few of us know any alternative, we have no idea how muchbetter we could do than the traditional employer-employee relationship.Such customs evolve with glacial slowness.  Our employer-employee relationship still retains a big chunk ofmaster-servant DNA.I dislike being on either end of it.I\\'ll work my ass off for a customer, but I resent being told whatto do by a boss.  And being a boss is also horribly frustrating; half the time it\\'s easier just to do stuff yourself than to getsomeone else to do it for you.I\\'d rather do almost anything than give or receive aperformance review.On top of its unpromising origins, employmenthas accumulated a lot of cruft over the years.  The list of whatyou can\\'t ask in job interviews is now so long that for convenienceI assume it\\'s infinite.  Within theoffice you now have to walk on eggshells lest anyonesayor dosomething that makes the company prey to a lawsuit.  And God helpyou if you fire anyone.Nothing shows more clearly that employment is not an ordinary economicrelationship than companies being sued for firing people.  In anypurely economic relationship you\\'re free to do what you want.  Ifyou want to stop buying steel pipe from one supplier and startbuying it from another, you don\\'t have to explain why.  No one canaccuse you ofunjustlyswitching pipe suppliers.  Justice impliessome kind of paternal obligation that isn\\'t there intransactions between equals.Most of the legal restrictions on employers are intended to protectemployees.  But you can\\'t have action without an equal and oppositereaction.  You can\\'t expect employers to have some kind of paternalresponsibility toward employees without putting employees in theposition of children.  And that seems a bad road to go down.Next time you\\'re in a moderately large city, drop by the main postoffice and watch the body language of the people working there.They have the same sullen resentment as children made to dosomething they don\\'t want to.  Their union has exacted payincreases and work restrictions that would have been the envy ofprevious generations of postal workers, and yet they don\\'t seem anyhappier for it.  It\\'s demoralizingto be on the receiving end of a paternalistic relationship, nomatter how cozy the terms.  Just ask any teenager.I see the disadvantages of the employer-employee relationship becauseI\\'ve been on both sides of a better one: the investor-founder relationship.I wouldn\\'t claim it\\'s painless.  When I was running astartup, the thought of our investors used to keep me up at night.And now that I\\'m aninvestor,the thought of our startups keeps meup at night.  All the pain of whatever problem you\\'re trying tosolve is still there.But the pain hurts less when it isn\\'tmixed with resentment.I had the misfortune to participate in what amounted to a controlledexperiment to prove that.  After Yahoo bought our startup I wentto work for them.  I was doing exactly the same work, except withbosses.  And to my horror I started acting like a child.  The situation pushed buttons I\\'d forgottenI had.The big advantage of investment over employment, as the examples of opensource and blogging suggest, is that people working on projects oftheir own are enormously more productive.  And astartupis a projectof one\\'s own in two senses, both of them important: it\\'s creativelyone\\'s own, and also economically ones\\'s own.Google is a rare example of a big company in tune with the forcesI\\'ve described. They\\'ve tried hard to make their offices less sterilethan the usual cube farm.  They give employees who do great worklarge grants of stock to simulate the rewards of a startup.  Theyeven let hackers spend 20% of their time on their own projects.Why not let people spend 100% of their time on their own projects,and instead of trying to approximate the value of what they create,give them the actual market value?  Impossible?  That is in factwhat venture capitalists do.So am I claiming that no one is going to be an employee anymore--that everyone should go and start a startup?  Of course not.But more people could do it than do it now.At the moment, even the smartest students leave school thinkingthey have to get ajob.  Actually what they need to do is makesomething valuable.  A job is one way to do that, but the moreambitious ones will ordinarily be better off taking money from aninvestor than an employer.Hackers tend to think business is for MBAs.  But businessadministration is not what you\\'re doing in a startup.  What you\\'redoing is businesscreation.  And the first phase of thatis mostly product creation-- that is, hacking.  That\\'s thehard part.  It\\'s a lot harder to create something people love thanto take something people love and figure out how to make money fromit.Another thing that keeps people away from starting startups is therisk.  Someone with kids and a mortgage should think twice beforedoing it.  But most young hackers have neither.And as the example of open source and blogging suggests, you\\'llenjoy it more, even if you fail.  You\\'ll be working on your ownthing, instead of going to some office and doing what you\\'re told.There may be more pain in your own company, but it won\\'t hurt asmuch.That may be the greatest effect, in the long run, of the forces underlying open source and blogging: finally ditching the oldpaternalistic employer-employee relationship, and replacing it witha purely economic one, between equals.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.November 2012The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startupideas.  It\\'s to look for problems, preferably problems you haveyourself.The very best startup ideas tend to have three things in common:they\\'re something the founders themselves want, that they themselvescan build, and that few others realize are worth doing.  Microsoft,Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all began this way.ProblemsWhy is it so important to work on a problem you have?  Among otherthings, it ensures the problem really exists.  It sounds obviousto say you should only work on problems that exist.  And yet by farthe most common mistake startups make is to solve problems no onehas.I made it myself.  In 1995 I started a company to put art galleriesonline.  But galleries didn\\'t want to be online.  It\\'s not how theart business works.  So why did I spend 6 months working on thisstupid idea?  Because I didn\\'t pay attention to users.  I inventeda model of the world that didn\\'t correspond to reality, and workedfrom that.  I didn\\'t notice my model was wrong until I triedto convince users to pay for what we\\'d built.  Even then I tookembarrassingly long to catch on.  I was attached to my model of theworld, and I\\'d spent a lot of time on the software.  They had towant it!Why do so many founders build things no one wants?  Because theybegin by trying to think of startup ideas.  That m.o. is doublydangerous: it doesn\\'t merely yield few good ideas; it yields badideas that sound plausible enough to fool you into working on them.At YC we call these \"made-up\" or \"sitcom\" startup ideas.  Imagineone of the characters on a TV show was starting a startup.  Thewriters would have to invent something for it to do.  But comingup with good startup ideas is hard.  It\\'s not something you can dofor the asking.  So (unless they got amazingly lucky) the writerswould come up with an idea that sounded plausible, but was actuallybad.For example, a social network for pet owners.  It doesn\\'t soundobviously mistaken.  Millions of people have pets.  Often they carea lot about their pets and spend a lot of money on them.  Surelymany of these people would like a site where they could talk toother pet owners.  Not all of them perhaps, but if just 2 or 3percent were regular visitors, you could have millions of users.You could serve them targeted offers, and maybe charge for premiumfeatures.The danger of an idea like this is that when you run it by yourfriends with pets, they don\\'t say \"I wouldneveruse this.\" Theysay \"Yeah, maybe I could see using something like that.\" Even whenthe startup launches, it will sound plausible to a lot of people.They don\\'t want to use it themselves, at least not right now, butthey could imagine other people wanting it.  Sum that reactionacross the entire population, and you have zero users.WellWhen a startup launches, there have to be at least some users whoreally need what they\\'re making — not just people who could seethemselves using it one day, but who want it urgently.  Usuallythis initial group of users is small, for the simple reason thatif there were something that large numbers of people urgently neededand that could be built with the amount of effort a startup usuallyputs into a version one, it would probably already exist.  Whichmeans you have to compromise on one dimension: you can either buildsomething a large number of people want a small amount, or somethinga small number of people want a large amount.  Choose the latter.Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly allgood startup ideas are of that type.Imagine a graph whose x axis represents all the people who mightwant what you\\'re making and whose y axis represents how much theywant it.  If you invert the scale on the y axis, you can envisioncompanies as holes.  Google is an immense crater: hundreds ofmillions of people use it, and they need it a lot.  A startup juststarting out can\\'t expect to excavate that much volume.  So youhave two choices about the shape of hole you start with.  You caneither dig a hole that\\'s broad but shallow, or one that\\'s narrowand deep, like a well.Made-up startup ideas are usually of the first type.  Lots of peopleare mildly interested in a social network for pet owners.Nearly all good startup ideas are of the second type.  Microsoftwas a well when they made Altair Basic.  There were only a couplethousand Altair owners, but without this software they were programmingin machine language.  Thirty years later Facebook had the sameshape.  Their first site was exclusively for Harvard students, ofwhich there are only a few thousand, but those few thousand userswanted it a lot.When you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants thisright now?  Who wants this so much that they\\'ll use it even whenit\\'s a crappy version one made by a two-person startup they\\'ve neverheard of?  If you can\\'t answer that, the idea is probably bad.You don\\'t need the narrowness of the well per se.  It\\'s depth youneed; you get narrowness as a byproduct of optimizing for depth(and speed).  But you almost always do get it.  In practice thelink between depth and narrowness is so strong that it\\'s a goodsign when you know that an idea will appeal strongly to a specificgroup or type of user.But while demand shaped like a well is almost a necessary conditionfor a good startup idea, it\\'s not a sufficient one.  If MarkZuckerberg had built something that could only ever have appealedto Harvard students, it would not have been a good startup idea.Facebook was a good idea because it started with a small marketthere was a fast path out of.  Colleges are similar enough that ifyou build a facebook that works at Harvard, it will work at anycollege. So you spread rapidly through all the colleges.  Once youhave all the college students, you get everyone else simply byletting them in.Similarly for Microsoft: Basic for the Altair; Basic for othermachines; other languages besides Basic; operating systems;applications; IPO.SelfHow do you tell whether there\\'s a path out of an idea?  How do youtell whether something is the germ of a giant company, or just aniche product?  Often you can\\'t. The founders of Airbnb didn\\'trealize at first how big a market they were tapping.  Initiallythey had a much narrower idea.  They were going to let hosts rentout space on their floors during conventions.  They didn\\'t foreseethe expansion of this idea; it forced itself upon them gradually.All they knew at first is that they were onto something.  That\\'sprobably as much as Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg knew at first.Occasionally it\\'s obvious from the beginning when there\\'s a pathout of the initial niche.  And sometimes I can see a path that\\'snot immediately obvious; that\\'s one of our specialties at YC.  Butthere are limits to how well this can be done, no matter how muchexperience you have.  The most important thing to understand aboutpaths out of the initial idea is the meta-fact that these are hardto see.So if you can\\'t predict whether there\\'s a path out of an idea, howdo you choose between ideas?  The truth is disappointing butinteresting: if you\\'re the right sort of person, you have the rightsort of hunches.  If you\\'re at the leading edge of a field that\\'schanging fast, when you have a hunch that something is worth doing,you\\'re more likely to be right.InZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig says:You want to know how to paint a perfect painting? It\\'s easy.  Make  yourself perfect and then just paint naturally.I\\'ve wondered about that passage since I read it in high school.I\\'m not sure how useful his advice is for painting specifically,but it fits this situation well.  Empirically, the way to have goodstartup ideas is to become the sort of person who has them.Being at the leading edge of a field doesn\\'t mean you have to beone of the people pushing it forward.  You can also be at the leadingedge as a user.  It was not so much because he was a programmerthat Facebook seemed a good idea to Mark Zuckerberg as because heused computers so much.  If you\\'d asked most 40 year olds in 2004whether they\\'d like to publish their lives semi-publicly on theInternet, they\\'d have been horrified at the idea.  But Mark alreadylived online; to him it seemed natural.Paul Buchheit says that people at the leading edge of a rapidlychanging field \"live in the future.\"  Combine that with Pirsig andyou get:Live in the future, then build what\\'s missing.That describes the way many if not most of the biggest startups gotstarted.  Neither Apple nor Yahoo nor Google nor Facebook were evensupposed to be companies at first.  They grew out of things theirfounders built because there seemed a gap in the world.If you look at the way successful founders have had their ideas,it\\'s generally the result of some external stimulus hitting aprepared mind.  Bill Gates and Paul Allen hear about the Altair andthink \"I bet we could write a Basic interpreter for it.\" Drew Houstonrealizes he\\'s forgotten his USB stick and thinks \"I really need tomake my files live online.\" Lots of people heard about the Altair.Lots forgot USB sticks.  The reason those stimuli caused thosefounders to start companies was that their experiences had preparedthem to notice the opportunities they represented.The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not\"think up\" but \"notice.\" At YC we call ideas that grow naturallyout of the founders\\' own experiences \"organic\" startup ideas.  Themost successful startups almost all begin this way.That may not have been what you wanted to hear.  You may haveexpected recipes for coming up with startup ideas, and instead I\\'mtelling you that the key is to have a mind that\\'s prepared in theright way.  But disappointing though it may be, this is the truth.And it is a recipe of a sort, just one that in the worst case takesa year rather than a weekend.If you\\'re not at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field,you can get to one.  For example, anyone reasonably smart canprobably get to an edge of programming (e.g. building mobile apps)in a year.  Since a successful startup will consume at least 3-5years of your life, a year\\'s preparation would be a reasonableinvestment.  Especially if you\\'re also looking for a cofounder.You don\\'t have to learn programming to be at the leading edge of adomain that\\'s changing fast.  Other domains change fast.  But whilelearning to hack is not necessary, it is for the forseeable futuresufficient. As Marc Andreessen put it, software is eating the world,and this trend has decades left to run.Knowing how to hack also means that when you have ideas, you\\'ll beable to implement them.  That\\'s not absolutely necessary (Jeff Bezoscouldn\\'t) but it\\'s an advantage.  It\\'s a big advantage, when you\\'reconsidering an idea like putting a college facebook online, ifinstead of merely thinking \"That\\'s an interesting idea,\" you canthink instead \"That\\'s an interesting idea.  I\\'ll try building aninitial version tonight.\"  It\\'s even better when you\\'re both aprogrammer and the target user, because then the cycle of generatingnew versions and testing them on users can happen inside one head.NoticingOnce you\\'re living in the future in some respect, the way to noticestartup ideas is to look for things that seem to be missing.  Ifyou\\'re really at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field, therewill be things that are obviously missing.  What won\\'t be obviousis that they\\'re startup ideas.  So if you want to find startupideas, don\\'t merely turn on the filter \"What\\'s missing?\" Also turnoff every other filter, particularly \"Could this be a big company?\"There\\'s plenty of time to apply that test later.  But if you\\'rethinking about that initially, it may not only filter out lotsof good ideas, but also cause you to focus on bad ones.Most things that are missing will take some time to see.  You almosthave to trick yourself into seeing the ideas around you.But youknowthe ideas are out there.  This is not one of thoseproblems where there might not be an answer.  It\\'s impossiblyunlikely that this is the exact moment when technological progressstops.  You can be sure people are going to build things in thenext few years that will make you think \"What did I do before x?\"And when these problems get solved, they will probably seem flaminglyobvious in retrospect.  What you need to do is turn off the filtersthat usually prevent you from seeing them.  The most powerful issimply taking the current state of the world for granted.  Even themost radically open-minded of us mostly do that.  You couldn\\'t getfrom your bed to the front door if you stopped to question everything.But if you\\'re looking for startup ideas you can sacrifice some ofthe efficiency of taking the status quo for granted and start toquestion things.  Why is your inbox overflowing?  Because you geta lot of email, or because it\\'s hard to get email out of your inbox?Why do you get so much email?  What problems are people trying tosolve by sending you email?  Are there better ways to solve them?And why is it hard to get emails out of your inbox?  Why do youkeep emails around after you\\'ve read them?  Is an inbox the optimaltool for that?Pay particular attention to things that chafe you.  The advantageof taking the status quo for granted is not just that it makes life(locally) more efficient, but also that it makes life more tolerable.If you knew about all the things we\\'ll get in the next 50 years butdon\\'t have yet, you\\'d find present day life pretty constraining,just as someone from the present would if they were sent back 50years in a time machine.  When something annoys you, it could bebecause you\\'re living in the future.When you find the right sort of problem, you should probably beable to describe it asobvious, at least to you.  When we startedViaweb, all the online stores were built by hand, by web designersmaking individual HTML pages.  It was obvious to us as programmersthat these sites would have to be generated by software.Which means, strangely enough, that coming up with startup ideasis a question of seeing the obvious.  That suggests how weird thisprocess is: you\\'re trying to see things that are obvious, and yetthat you hadn\\'t seen.Since what you need to do here is loosen up your own mind, it maybe best not to make too much of a direct frontal attack on theproblem — i.e. to sit down and try to think of ideas.  The bestplan may be just to keep a background process running, looking forthings that seem to be missing.  Work on hard problems, drivenmainly by curiosity, but have a second self watching over yourshoulder, taking note of gaps and anomalies.Give yourself some time.  You have a lot of control over the rateat which you turn yours into a prepared mind, but you have lesscontrol over the stimuli that spark ideas when they hit it.  IfBill Gates and Paul Allen had constrained themselves to come upwith a startup idea in one month, what if they\\'d chosen a monthbefore the Altair appeared?  They probably would have worked on aless promising idea.  Drew Houston did work on a less promisingidea before Dropbox: an SAT prep startup.  But Dropbox was a muchbetter idea, both in the absolute sense and also as a match for hisskills.A good way to trick yourself into noticing ideas is to work onprojects that seem like they\\'d be cool.  If you do that, you\\'llnaturally tend to build things that are missing.  It wouldn\\'t seemas interesting to build something that already existed.Just as trying to think up startup ideas tends to produce bad ones,working on things that could be dismissed as \"toys\" often producesgood ones.  When something is described as a toy, that means it haseverything an idea needs except being important.  It\\'s cool; userslove it; it just doesn\\'t matter.  But if you\\'re living in the futureand you build something cool that users love, it may matter morethan outsiders think.  Microcomputers seemed like toys when Appleand Microsoft started working on them.  I\\'m old enough to rememberthat era; the usual term for people with their own microcomputerswas \"hobbyists.\"  BackRub seemed like an inconsequential scienceproject.  The Facebook was just a way for undergrads to stalk oneanother.At YC we\\'re excited when we meet startups working on things thatwe could imagine know-it-alls on forums dismissing as toys.  To usthat\\'s positive evidence an idea is good.If you can afford to take a long view (and arguably you can\\'t affordnot to), you can turn \"Live in the future and build what\\'s missing\"into something even better:Live in the future and build what seems interesting.SchoolThat\\'s what I\\'d advise college students to do, rather than tryingto learn about \"entrepreneurship.\"  \"Entrepreneurship\" is somethingyou learn best by doing it.  The examples of the most successfulfounders make that clear.  What you should be spending your timeon in college is ratcheting yourself into the future.  College isan incomparable opportunity to do that.  What a waste to sacrificean opportunity to solve the hard part of starting a startup — becoming the sort of person who can have organic startup ideas — by spending time learning about the easy part.  Especially sinceyou won\\'t even really learn about it, any more than you\\'d learnabout sex in a class.  All you\\'ll learn is the words for things.The clash of domains is a particularly fruitful source of ideas.If you know a lot about programming and you start learning aboutsome other field, you\\'ll probably see problems that software couldsolve.  In fact, you\\'re doubly likely to find good problems inanother domain: (a) the inhabitants of that domain are not as likelyas software people to have already solved their problems withsoftware, and (b) since you come into the new domain totally ignorant,you don\\'t even know what the status quo is to take it for granted.So if you\\'re a CS major and you want to start a startup, insteadof taking a class on entrepreneurship you\\'re better off taking aclass on, say, genetics.  Or better still, go work for a biotechcompany.  CS majors normally get summer jobs at computer hardwareor software companies.  But if you want to find startup ideas, youmight do better to get a summer job in some unrelated field.Or don\\'t take any extra classes, and just build things.  It\\'s nocoincidence that Microsoft and Facebook both got started in January.At Harvard that is (or was) Reading Period, when students have noclasses to attend because they\\'re supposed to be studying for finals.But don\\'t feel like you have to build things that will become startups.  That\\'spremature optimization. Just build things.  Preferably with otherstudents.  It\\'s not just the classes that make a university such agood place to crank oneself into the future.  You\\'re also surroundedby other people trying to do the same thing.  If you work togetherwith them on projects, you\\'ll end up producing not just organicideas, but organic ideas with organic founding teams — and that,empirically, is the best combination.Beware of research.  If an undergrad writes something all his friendsstart using, it\\'s quite likely to represent a good startup idea.Whereas a PhD dissertation is extremely unlikely to.  For somereason, the more a project has to count as research, the less likelyit is to be something that could be turned into a startup.I think the reason is that the subset of ideas that count as researchis so narrow that it\\'s unlikely that a project that satisfied thatconstraint would also satisfy the orthogonal constraint of solvingusers\\' problems.  Whereas when students (or professors) buildsomething as a side-project, they automatically gravitate towardsolving users\\' problems — perhaps even with an additional energythat comes from being freed from the constraints of research.CompetitionBecause a good idea should seem obvious, when you have one you\\'lltend to feel that you\\'re late.  Don\\'t let that deter you.  Worryingthat you\\'re late is one of the signs of a good idea.  Ten minutesof searching the web will usually settle the question.  Even if youfind someone else working on the same thing, you\\'re probably nottoo late.  It\\'s exceptionally rare for startups to be killed bycompetitors — so rare that you can almost discount the possibility.So unless you discover a competitor with the sort of lock-in thatwould prevent users from choosing you, don\\'t discard the idea.If you\\'re uncertain, ask users.  The question of whether you\\'re toolate is subsumed by the question of whether anyone urgently needswhat you plan to make.  If you have something that no competitordoes and that some subset of users urgently need, you have abeachhead.The question then is whether that beachhead is big enough. Or moreimportantly, who\\'s in it: if the beachhead consists of people doingsomething lots more people will be doing in the future, then it\\'sprobably big enough no matter how small it is.  For example, ifyou\\'re building something differentiated from competitors by thefact that it works on phones, but it only works on the newest phones,that\\'s probably a big enough beachhead.Err on the side of doing things where you\\'ll face competitors.Inexperienced founders usually give competitors more credit thanthey deserve.  Whether you succeed depends far more on you than onyour competitors.  So better a good idea with competitors than abad one without.You don\\'t need to worry about entering a \"crowded market\" so longas you have a thesis about what everyone else in it is overlooking.In fact that\\'s a very promising starting point.  Google was thattype of idea.  Your thesis has to be more precise than \"we\\'re goingto make an x that doesn\\'t suck\" though. You have to be able tophrase it in terms of something the incumbents are overlooking.Best of all is when you can say that they didn\\'t have the courageof their convictions, and that your plan is what they\\'d have doneif they\\'d followed through on their own insights.  Google was thattype of idea too.  The search engines that preceded them shied awayfrom the most radical implications of what they were doing — particularly that the better a job they did, the faster users wouldleave.A crowded market is actually a good sign, because it means boththat there\\'s demand and that none of the existing solutions aregood enough.  A startup can\\'t hope to enter a market that\\'s obviouslybig and yet in which they have no competitors.  So any startup thatsucceeds is either going to be entering a market with existingcompetitors, but armed with some secret weapon that will get themall the users (like Google), or entering a market that looks smallbut which will turn out to be big (like Microsoft).FiltersThere are two more filters you\\'ll need to turn off if you want tonotice startup ideas: the unsexy filter and the schlep filter.Most programmers wish they could start a startup by just writingsome brilliant code, pushing it to a server, and having users paythem lots of money.  They\\'d prefer not to deal with tedious problemsor get involved in messy ways with the real world.  Which is areasonable preference, because such things slow you down.  But thispreference is so widespread that the space of convenient startupideas has been stripped pretty clean.  If you let your mind wandera few blocks down the street to the messy, tedious ideas, you\\'llfind valuable ones just sitting there waiting to be implemented.The schlep filter is so dangerous that I wrote a separate essayabout the condition it induces, which I calledschlep blindness.I gave Stripe as an example of a startup that benefited from turningoff this filter, and a pretty striking example it is.  Thousandsof programmers were in a position to see this idea; thousands ofprogrammers knew how painful it was to process payments beforeStripe.  But when they looked for startup ideas they didn\\'t seethis one, because unconsciously they shrank from having to dealwith payments.  And dealing with payments is a schlep for Stripe,but not an intolerable one.  In fact they might have had net lesspain; because the fear of dealing with payments kept most peopleaway from this idea, Stripe has had comparatively smooth sailingin other areas that are sometimes painful, like user acquisition.They didn\\'t have to try very hard to make themselves heard by users,because users were desperately waiting for what they were building.The unsexy filter is similar to the schlep filter, except it keepsyou from working on problems you despise rather than ones you fear.We overcame this one to work on Viaweb. There were interestingthings about the architecture of our software, but we weren\\'tinterested in ecommerce per se.  We could see the problem was onethat needed to be solved though.Turning off the schlep filter is more important than turning offthe unsexy filter, because the schlep filter is more likely to bean illusion.  And even to the degree it isn\\'t, it\\'s a worse formof self-indulgence.  Starting a successful startup is going to befairly laborious no matter what.  Even if the product doesn\\'t entaila lot of schleps, you\\'ll still have plenty dealing with investors,hiring and firing people, and so on.  So if there\\'s some idea youthink would be cool but you\\'re kept away from by fear of the schlepsinvolved, don\\'t worry: any sufficiently good idea will have as many.The unsexy filter, while still a source of error, is not as entirelyuseless as the schlep filter.  If you\\'re at the leading edge of afield that\\'s changing rapidly, your ideas about what\\'s sexy willbe somewhat correlated with what\\'s valuable in practice.  Particularlyas you get older and more experienced.  Plus if you find an ideasexy, you\\'ll work on it more enthusiastically.RecipesWhile the best way to discover startup ideas is to become the sortof person who has them and then build whatever interests you,sometimes you don\\'t have that luxury.  Sometimes you need an ideanow.  For example, if you\\'re working on a startup and your initialidea turns out to be bad.For the rest of this essay I\\'ll talk about tricks for coming upwith startup ideas on demand.  Although empirically you\\'re betteroff using the organic strategy, you could succeed this way. Youjust have to be more disciplined.  When you use the organic method,you don\\'t even notice an idea unless it\\'s evidence that somethingis truly missing.  But when you make a conscious effort to thinkof startup ideas, you have to replace this natural constraint withself-discipline.  You\\'ll see a lot more ideas, most of them bad,so you need to be able to filter them.One of the biggest dangers of not using the organic method is theexample of the organic method.  Organic ideas feel like inspirations.There are a lot of stories about successful startups that beganwhen the founders had what seemed a crazy idea but \"just knew\" itwas promising.  When you feel that about an idea you\\'ve had whiletrying to come up with startup ideas, you\\'re probably mistaken.When searching for ideas, look in areas where you have some expertise.If you\\'re a database expert, don\\'t build a chat app for teenagers(unless you\\'re also a teenager).  Maybe it\\'s a good idea, but youcan\\'t trust your judgment about that, so ignore it.  There have tobe other ideas that involve databases, and whose quality you canjudge.  Do you find it hard to come up with good ideas involvingdatabases?  That\\'s because your expertise raises your standards.Your ideas about chat apps are just as bad, but you\\'re givingyourself a Dunning-Kruger pass in that domain.The place to start looking for ideas is things you need.  Theremustbe things you need.One good trick is to ask yourself whether in your previous job youever found yourself saying \"Why doesn\\'t someone make x?  If someonemade x we\\'d buy it in a second.\" If you can think of any x peoplesaid that about, you probably have an idea.  You know there\\'s demand,and people don\\'t say that about things that are impossible to build.More generally, try asking yourself whether there\\'s something unusualabout you that makes your needs different from most other people\\'s.You\\'re probably not the only one.  It\\'s especially good if you\\'redifferent in a way people will increasingly be.If you\\'re changing ideas, one unusual thing about you is the ideayou\\'d previously been working on.  Did you discover any needs whileworking on it?  Several well-known startups began this way.  Hotmailbegan as something its founders wrote to talk about their previousstartup idea while they were working at their day jobs.A particularly promising way to be unusual is to be young.  Someof the most valuable new ideas take root first among people in theirteens and early twenties.  And while young founders are at adisadvantage in some respects, they\\'re the only ones who reallyunderstand their peers.  It would have been very hard for someonewho wasn\\'t a college student to start Facebook.  So if you\\'re ayoung founder (under 23 say), are there things you and your friendswould like to do that current technology won\\'t let you?The next best thing to an unmet need of your own is an unmet needof someone else.  Try talking to everyone you can about the gapsthey find in the world.  What\\'s missing?  What would they like todo that they can\\'t?  What\\'s tedious or annoying, particularly intheir work?  Let the conversation get general; don\\'t be trying toohard to find startup ideas.  You\\'re just looking for something tospark a thought.  Maybe you\\'ll notice a problem they didn\\'t consciouslyrealize they had, because you know how to solve it.When you find an unmet need that isn\\'t your own, it may be somewhatblurry at first.  The person who needs something may not know exactlywhat they need.  In that case I often recommend that founders actlike consultants — that they do what they\\'d do if they\\'d beenretained to solve the problems of this one user.  People\\'s problemsare similar enough that nearly all the code you write this way willbe reusable, and whatever isn\\'t will be a small price to start outcertain that you\\'ve reached the bottom of the well.One way to ensure you do a good job solving other people\\'s problemsis to make them your own.  When Rajat Suri of E la Carte decidedto write software for restaurants, he got a job as a waiter to learnhow restaurants worked.  That may seem like taking things to extremes,but startups are extreme.  We love it when founders do such things.In fact, one strategy I recommend to people who need a new idea isnot merely to turn off their schlep and unsexy filters, but to seekout ideas that are unsexy or involve schleps.  Don\\'t try to startTwitter.  Those ideas are so rare that you can\\'t find them by lookingfor them.  Make something unsexy that people will pay you for.A good trick for bypassing the schlep and to some extent the unsexyfilter is to ask what you wish someone else would build, so thatyou could use it.  What would you pay for right now?Since startups often garbage-collect broken companies and industries,it can be a good trick to look for those that are dying, or deserveto, and try to imagine what kind of company would profit from theirdemise.  For example, journalism is in free fall at the moment.But there may still be money to be made from something like journalism.What sort of company might cause people in the future to say \"thisreplaced journalism\" on some axis?But imagine asking that in the future, not now.  When one companyor industry replaces another, it usually comes in from the side.So don\\'t look for a replacement for x; look for something thatpeople will later say turned out to be a replacement for x.  Andbe imaginative about the axis along which the replacement occurs.Traditional journalism, for example, is a way for readers to getinformation and to kill time, a way for writers to make money andto get attention, and a vehicle for several different types ofadvertising.  It could be replaced on any of these axes (it hasalready started to be on most).When startups consume incumbents, they usually start by servingsome small but important market that the big players ignore.  It\\'sparticularly good if there\\'s an admixture of disdain in the bigplayers\\' attitude, because that often misleads them.  For example,after Steve Wozniak built the computer that became the Apple I, hefelt obliged to give his then-employer Hewlett-Packard the optionto produce it.  Fortunately for him, they turned it down, and oneof the reasons they did was that it used a TV for a monitor, whichseemed intolerably déclassé to a high-end hardware company like HPwas at the time.Are there groups ofscruffybut sophisticated users like the earlymicrocomputer \"hobbyists\" that are currently being ignored by thebig players?  A startup with its sights set on bigger things canoften capture a small market easily by expending an effort thatwouldn\\'t be justified by that market alone.Similarly, since the most successful startups generally ride somewave bigger than themselves, it could be a good trick to look forwaves and ask how one could benefit from them.  The prices of genesequencing and 3D printing are both experiencing Moore\\'s Law-likedeclines.  What new things will we be able to do in the new worldwe\\'ll have in a few years?  What are we unconsciously ruling outas impossible that will soon be possible?OrganicBut talking about looking explicitly for waves makes it clear thatsuch recipes are plan B for getting startup ideas.  Looking forwaves is essentially a way to simulate the organic method.  Ifyou\\'re at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field, you don\\'thave to look for waves; you are the wave.Finding startup ideas is a subtle business, and that\\'s why mostpeople who try fail so miserably.  It doesn\\'t work well simply totry to think of startup ideas.  If you do that, you get bad onesthat sound dangerously plausible.  The best approach is more indirect:if you have the right sort of background, good startup ideas willseem obvious to you.  But even then, not immediately.  It takestime to come across situations where you notice something missing.And often these gaps won\\'t seem to be ideas for companies, justthings that would be interesting to build.  Which is why it\\'s goodto have the time and the inclination to build things just becausethey\\'re interesting.Live in the future and build what seems interesting.  Strange asit sounds, that\\'s the real recipe.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.March 2008, rev. June 2008Technology tends to separate normal from natural.  Our bodiesweren\\'t designed to eat the foods that people in rich countries eat, orto get so little exercise.  There may be a similar problem with the way we work: a normal job may be as bad for us intellectually as white flouror sugar is for us physically.I began to suspect this after spending several years working with startup founders.  I\\'ve now worked with over 200 of them, and I\\'venoticed a definite difference between programmers working on theirown startups and those working for large organizations.I wouldn\\'t say founders seem happier, necessarily;starting a startup can be very stressful. Maybe the best way to putit is to say that they\\'re happier in the sense that your body ishappier during a long run than sitting on a sofa eatingdoughnuts.Though they\\'re statistically abnormal, startup founders seem to beworking in a way that\\'s more natural for humans.I was in Africa last year and saw a lot of animals in the wild thatI\\'d only seen in zoos before. It was remarkable how different theyseemed. Particularly lions. Lions in the wild seem about ten timesmore alive. They\\'re like different animals. I suspect that workingfor oneself feels better to humans in much the same way that livingin the wild must feel better to a wide-ranging predator like a lion.Life in a zoo is easier, but it isn\\'t the life they were designedfor.TreesWhat\\'s so unnatural about working for a big company?  The root ofthe problem is that humans weren\\'t meant to work in such largegroups.Another thing you notice when you see animals in the wild is thateach species thrives in groups of a certain size.  A herd of impalasmight have 100 adults; baboons maybe 20; lions rarely 10.  Humansalso seem designed to work in groups, and what I\\'ve read abouthunter-gatherers accords with research on organizations and my ownexperience to suggest roughly what the ideal size is: groups of 8work well; by 20 they\\'re getting hard to manage; and a group of 50is really unwieldy.Whatever the upper limit is, we are clearly not meant to work ingroups of several hundred.  And yet—for reasons having moreto do with technology than human nature—a great many peoplework for companies with hundreds or thousands of employees.Companies know groups that large wouldn\\'t work, so they dividethemselves into units small enough to work together.  But tocoordinate these they have to introduce something new: bosses.These smaller groups are always arranged in a tree structure.  Yourboss is the point where your group attaches to the tree.  But whenyou use this trick for dividing a large group into smaller ones,something strange happens that I\\'ve never heard anyone mentionexplicitly.  In the group one level up from yours, your bossrepresents your entire group.  A group of 10 managers is not merelya group of 10 people working together in the usual way.  It\\'s reallya group of groups.  Which means for a group of 10 managers to worktogether as if they were simply a group of 10 individuals, the groupworking for each manager would have to work as if they were a singleperson—the workers and manager would each share only oneperson\\'s worth of freedom between them.In practice a group of people are never able to act as if they wereone person.  But in a large organization divided into groups inthis way, the pressure is always in that direction.  Each grouptries its best to work as if it were the small group of individualsthat humans were designed to work in.  That was the point of creatingit.  And when you propagate that constraint, the result is thateach person gets freedom of action in inverse proportion to thesize of the entire tree.Anyone who\\'s worked for a large organization has felt this.  Youcan feel the difference between working for a company with 100employees and one with 10,000, even if your group has only 10 people.Corn SyrupA group of 10 people within a large organization is a kind of faketribe.  The number of people you interact with is about right.  Butsomething is missing: individual initiative.  Tribes of hunter-gatherershave much more freedom.  The leaders have a little more power than othermembers of the tribe, but they don\\'t generally tell them what todo and when the way a boss can.It\\'s not your boss\\'s fault.  The real problem is that in the groupabove you in the hierarchy, your entire group is one virtual person.Your boss is just the way that constraint is imparted to you.So working in a group of 10 people within a large organization feelsboth right and wrong at the same time.   On the surface it feelslike the kind of group you\\'re meant to work in, but something majoris missing.  A job at a big company is like high fructose cornsyrup: it has some of the qualities of things you\\'re meant to like,but is disastrously lacking in others.Indeed, food is an excellent metaphor to explain what\\'s wrong withthe usual sort of job.For example, working for a big company is the default thing to do,at least for programmers.  How bad could it be?  Well, food showsthat pretty clearly.  If you were dropped at a random point inAmerica today, nearly all the food around you would be bad for you.Humans were not designed to eat white flour, refined sugar, highfructose corn syrup, and hydrogenated vegetable oil.  And yet ifyou analyzed the contents of the average grocery store you\\'d probablyfind these four ingredients accounted for most of the calories.\"Normal\" food is terribly bad for you.  The only people who eatwhat humans were actually designed to eat are a few Birkenstock-wearingweirdos in Berkeley.If \"normal\" food is so bad for us, why is it so common?  There aretwo main reasons. One is that it has more immediate appeal.  Youmay feel lousy an hour after eating that pizza, but eating the firstcouple bites feels great.  The other is economies of scale.Producing junk food scales; producing fresh vegetables doesn\\'t.Which means (a) junk food can be very cheap, and (b) it\\'s worthspending a lot to market it.If people have to choose between something that\\'s cheap, heavilymarketed, and appealing in the short term, and something that\\'sexpensive, obscure, and appealing in the long term, which do youthink most will choose?It\\'s the same with work.  The average MIT graduate wants to workat Google or Microsoft, because it\\'s a recognized brand, it\\'s safe,and they\\'ll get paid a good salary right away.  It\\'s the jobequivalent of the pizza they had for lunch.  The drawbacks willonly become apparent later, and then only in a vague sense ofmalaise.And founders and early employees of startups, meanwhile, are likethe Birkenstock-wearing weirdos of Berkeley:  though a tiny minorityof the population, they\\'re the ones living as humans are meant to.In an artificial world, only extremists live naturally.ProgrammersThe restrictiveness of big company jobs is particularly hard onprogrammers, because the essence of programming is to build newthings.  Sales people make much the same pitches every day; supportpeople answer much the same questions; but once you\\'ve written apiece of code you don\\'t need to write it again.  So a programmerworking as programmers are meant to is always making new things.And when you\\'re part of an organization whose structure gives eachperson freedom in inverse proportion to the size of the tree, you\\'regoing to face resistance when you do something new.This seems an inevitable consequence of bigness.  It\\'s true evenin the smartest companies.  I was talking recently to a founder whoconsidered starting a startup right out of college, but went towork for Google instead because he thought he\\'d learn more there.He didn\\'t learn as much as he expected.  Programmers learn by doing,and most of the things he wanted to do, he couldn\\'t—sometimesbecause the company wouldn\\'t let him, but often because the company\\'scode wouldn\\'t let him.  Between the drag of legacy code, the overheadof doing development in such a large organization, and the restrictionsimposed by interfaces owned by other groups, he could only try afraction of the things he would have liked to.  He said he haslearned much more in his own startup, despite the fact that he hasto do all the company\\'s errands as well as programming, because atleast when he\\'s programming he can do whatever he wants.An obstacle downstream propagates upstream.  If you\\'re not allowedto implement new ideas, you stop having them.  And vice versa: whenyou can do whatever you want, you have more ideas about what to do.So working for yourself makes your brain more powerful in the sameway a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.Working for yourself doesn\\'t have to mean starting a startup, ofcourse.  But a programmer deciding between a regular job at a bigcompany and their own startup is probably going to learn more doingthe startup.You can adjust the amount of freedom you get by scaling the sizeof company you work for.  If you start the company, you\\'ll have themost freedom.  If you become one of the first 10 employees you\\'llhave almost as much freedom as the founders.  Even a company with100 people will feel different from one with 1000.Working for a small company doesn\\'t ensure freedom.  The treestructure of large organizations sets an upper bound on freedom,not a lower bound.  The head of a small company may still chooseto be a tyrant.  The point is that a large organization is compelledby its structure to be one.ConsequencesThat has real consequences for both organizations and individuals.One is that companies will inevitably slow down as they grow larger,no matter how hard they try to keep their startup mojo.  It\\'s aconsequence of the tree structure that every large organization isforced to adopt.Or rather, a large organization could only avoid slowing down ifthey avoided tree structure.  And since human nature limits thesize of group that can work together, the only way I can imaginefor larger groups to avoid tree structure would be to have nostructure: to have each group actually be independent, and to worktogether the way components of a market economy do.That might be worth exploring.  I suspect there are already somehighly partitionable businesses that lean this way.  But I don\\'tknow any technology companies that have done it.There is one thing companies can do short of structuring themselvesas sponges:  they can stay small.  If I\\'m right, then it reallypays to keep a company as small as it can be at every stage.Particularly a technology company.  Which means it\\'s doubly importantto hire the best people.  Mediocre hires hurt you twice: they getless done, but they also make you big, because you need more ofthem to solve a given problem.For individuals the upshot is the same: aim small.  It will alwayssuck to work for large organizations, and the larger the organization,the more it will suck.In anessayI wrote a couple years ago I advised graduating seniorsto work for a couple years for another company before starting theirown.  I\\'d modify that now.  Work for another company if you wantto, but only for a small one, and if you want to start your ownstartup, go ahead.The reason I suggested college graduates not start startups immediatelywas that I felt most would fail.  And they will.  But ambitiousprogrammers are better off doing their own thing and failing thangoing to work at a big company.  Certainly they\\'ll learn more.  Theymight even be better off financially.  A lot of people in theirearly twenties get into debt, because their expenses grow evenfaster than the salary that seemed so high when they left school.At least if you start a startup and fail your net worth will bezero rather than negative.We\\'ve now funded so many different types of founders that we haveenough data to see patterns, and there seems to be no benefit fromworking for a big company.  The people who\\'ve worked for a few yearsdo seem better than the ones straight out of college, but onlybecause they\\'re that much older.The people who come to us from big companies often seem kind ofconservative.  It\\'s hard to say how much is because big companiesmade them that way, and how much is the natural conservatism thatmade them work for the big companies in the first place.  Butcertainly a large part of it is learned.  I know because I\\'ve seenit burn off.Having seen that happen so many times is one of the things thatconvinces me that working for oneself, or at least for a smallgroup, is the natural way for programmers to live.  Founders arrivingat Y Combinator often have the downtrodden air of refugees.  Threemonths later they\\'re transformed: they have so much moreconfidencethat they seem as if they\\'ve grown several inches taller.Strange as this sounds, they seem both more worried and happier at the sametime.  Which is exactly how I\\'d describe the way lions seem in thewild.Watching employees get transformed into founders makes it clearthat the difference between the two is due mostly to environment—andin particular that the environment in big companies is toxic toprogrammers.   In the first couple weeks of working on their ownstartup they seem to come to life, because finally they\\'re workingthe way people are meant to.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.September 2013Most startups that raise money do it more than once.  A typicaltrajectory might be (1) to get started with a few tens of thousandsfrom something like Y Combinator or individual angels, then (2) raise a few hundred thousand to a few million to build the company,and then (3) once the company is clearly succeeding, raise one ormore later rounds to accelerate growth.Reality can be messier.  Some companies raise money twice in phase2.  Others skip phase 1 and go straight to phase 2.  And at Y\\xa0Combinator we get an increasing number of companies that have alreadyraised amounts in the hundreds of thousands.  But the three phasepath is at least the one about which individual startups\\' pathsoscillate.This essay focuses on phase 2 fundraising.  That\\'s the type thestartups we fund are doing on Demo Day, and this essay is the advicewe give them.ForcesFundraising is hard in both senses: hard like lifting a heavy weight,and hard like solving a puzzle.  It\\'s hard like lifting a weightbecause it\\'s intrinsically hard to convince people to part withlarge sums of money.  That problem is irreducible; it should behard.  But much of the other kind of difficulty can be eliminated.Fundraising only seems a puzzle because it\\'s an alien world to mostfounders, and I hope to fix that by supplying a map through it.To founders, the behavior of investors is often opaque — partlybecause their motivations are obscure, but partly because theydeliberately mislead you.  And the misleading ways of investorscombine horribly with the wishful thinking of inexperienced founders.At YC we\\'re always warning founders about this danger, and investorsare probably more circumspect with YC startups than with othercompanies they talk to, and even so we witness a constant seriesof explosions as these two volatile components combine.If you\\'re an inexperienced founder, the only way to survive is byimposing external constraints on yourself.  You can\\'t trust yourintuitions.  I\\'m going to give you a set of rules here that willget you through this process if anything will.  At certain momentsyou\\'ll be tempted to ignore them.  So rule number zero is: theserules exist for a reason.  You wouldn\\'t need a rule to keep yougoing in one direction if there weren\\'t powerful forces pushing youin another.The ultimate source of the forces acting on you are the forcesacting on investors.  Investors are pinched between two kinds offear: fear of investing in startups that fizzle, and fear of missingout on startups that take off.  The cause of all this fear is thevery thing that makes startups such attractive investments: thesuccessful ones grow very fast.  But that fast growth means investorscan\\'t wait around.  If you wait till a startup is obviously asuccess, it\\'s too late.  To get the really high returns, you haveto invest in startups when it\\'s still unclear how they\\'ll do.  Butthat in turn makes investors nervous they\\'re about to invest in aflop.  As indeed they often are.What investors would like to do, if they could, is wait.  When astartup is only a few months old, every week that passes gives yousignificantly more information about them.  But if you wait toolong, other investors might take the deal away from you.  And ofcourse the other investors are all subject to the same forces.  Sowhat tends to happen is that they all wait as long as they can,then when some act the rest have to.Don\\'t raise money unless you want it and it wants you.Such a high proportion of successful startups raise money that itmight seem fundraising is one of the defining qualities of a startup.Actually it isn\\'t.Rapid growthis whatmakes a company a startup.  Most companies in a position to growrapidly find that (a) taking outside money helps them grow faster,and (b) their growth potential makes it easy to attract such money.It\\'s so common for both (a) and (b) to be true of a successfulstartup that practically all do raise outside money.  But there maybe cases where a startup either wouldn\\'t want to grow faster, oroutside money wouldn\\'t help them to, and if you\\'re one of them,don\\'t raise money.The other time not to raise money is when you won\\'t be able to.  Ifyou try to raise money before you canconvinceinvestors, you\\'ll not only waste your time, but also burn yourreputation with those investors.Be in fundraising mode or not.One of the things that surprises founders most about fundraisingis how distracting it is.  When you start fundraising, everythingelse grinds to a halt.  The problem is not the time fundraisingconsumes but that it becomes thetop idea inyour mind.  A startup can\\'t endure that level of distractionfor long.  An early stage startup grows mostly because the foundersmakeit grow, and if the founders look away,growth usually drops sharply.Because fundraising is so distracting, a startup should either bein fundraising mode or not.  And when you do decide to raise money,you should focus your whole attention on it so you can get it donequickly and get back to work.You can take money from investors when you\\'re not in fundraisingmode.  You just can\\'t expend any attention on it.  There are twothings that take attention: convincing investors, and negotiatingwith them.  So when you\\'re not in fundraising mode, you should takemoney from investors only if they require no convincing, and arewilling to invest on terms you\\'ll take without negotiation.  Forexample, if a reputable investor is willing to invest on a convertiblenote, using standard paperwork, that is either uncapped or cappedat a good valuation, you can take that without having to think.The terms will be whatever they turn out to be in your nextequity round.  And \"no convincing\" means just that: zero time spentmeeting with investors or preparing materials for them.  If aninvestor says they\\'re ready to invest, but they need you to comein for one meeting to meet some of the partners, tell them no, ifyou\\'re not in fundraising mode, because that\\'s fundraising.Tell them politely; tell them you\\'re focusing on the company rightnow, and that you\\'ll get back to them when you\\'re fundraising; butdo not get sucked down the slippery slope.Investors will try to lure you into fundraising when you\\'re not.It\\'s great for them if they can, because they can thereby get ashot at you before everyone else.  They\\'ll send you emails sayingthey want to meet to learn more about you.  If you get cold-emailedby an associate at a VC firm, you shouldn\\'t meet even if you arein fundraising mode.  Deals don\\'t happen that way.But evenif you get an email from a partner you should try to delay meetingtill you\\'re in fundraising mode.  They may say they just want tomeet and chat, but investors never just want to meet and chat.  Whatif they like you?  What if they start to talk about giving youmoney?  Will you be able to resist having that conversation?  Unlessyou\\'re experienced enough at fundraising to have a casual conversationwith investors that stays casual, it\\'s safer to tell them that you\\'dbe happy to later, when you\\'re fundraising, but that right now youneed to focus on the company.Companies that are successful at raising money in phase 2 sometimestack on a few investors after leaving fundraising mode.  This isfine; if fundraising went well, you\\'ll be able to do it withoutspending time convincing them or negotiating about terms.Get introductions to investors.Before you can talk to investors, you have to be introduced to them.If you\\'re presenting at a Demo Day, you\\'ll be introduced to a wholebunch simultaneously.  But even if you are, you should supplementthese with intros you collect yourself.Do you have to be introduced?  In phase 2, yes.  Some investorswill let you email them a business plan, but you can tell from theway their sites are organized that they don\\'t really want startupsto approach them directly.Intros vary greatly in effectiveness.  The best type of intro isfrom a well-known investor who has just invested in you.  So whenyou get an investor to commit, ask them to introduce you to otherinvestors they respect.The next best type of intro is from afounder of a company they\\'ve funded.  You can also get intros fromother people in the startup community, like lawyers and reporters.There are now sites like AngelList, FundersClub, and WeFunder thatcan introduce you to investors.  We recommend startups treat themas auxiliary sources of money.  Raise money first from leads youget yourself.  Those will on average be better investors.  Plusyou\\'ll have an easier time raising money on these sites once youcan say you\\'ve already raised some from well-known investors.Hear no till you hear yes.Treat investors as saying no till they unequivocally say yes, inthe form of a definite offer with no contingencies.I mentioned earlier that investors prefer to wait if they can.What\\'s particularly dangerous for founders is the way they wait.Essentially, they lead you on.  They seem like they\\'re about toinvest right up till the moment they say no.  If they even say no.Some of the worse ones never actually do say no; they just stopreplying to your emails.  They hope that way to get a free optionon investing.  If they decide later that they want to invest — usuallybecause they\\'ve heard you\\'re a hot deal — they can pretend theyjust got distracted and then restart the conversation as if they\\'dbeen about to.That\\'s not the worst thing investors will do.  Some will use languagethat makes it sound as if they\\'re committing, but which doesn\\'tactually commit them.  And wishful thinking founders are happy tomeet them half way.Fortunately, the next rule is a tactic for neutralizing this behavior.But to work it depends on you not being tricked by the no thatsounds like yes.  It\\'s so common for founders to be misled/mistakenabout this that we designed aprotocolto fix theproblem.  If you believe an investor has committed, get them toconfirm it.  If you and they have different views of reality, whetherthe source of the discrepancy is their sketchiness or your wishfulthinking, the prospect of confirming a commitment in writing willflush it out.  And till they confirm, regard them as saying no.Do breadth-first search weighted by expected value.When you talk to investors your m.o. should be breadth-first search,weighted by expected value.  You should always talk to investorsin parallel rather than serially.  You can\\'t afford the time ittakes to talk to investors serially, plus if you only talk to oneinvestor at a time, they don\\'t have the pressure of other investorsto make them act.  But you shouldn\\'t pay the same attention to everyinvestor, because some are more promising prospects than others.The optimal solution is to talk to all potential investors inparallel, but give higher priority to the more promising ones.Expected value = how likely an investor is to say yes, multipliedby how good it would be if they did.  So for example, an eminentinvestor who would invest a lot, but will be hard to convince, mighthave the same expected value as an obscure angel who won\\'t investmuch, but will be easy to convince.  Whereas an obscure angel whowill only invest a small amount, and yet needs to meet multipletimes before making up his mind, has very low expected value.  Meetsuch investors last, if at all.Doing breadth-first search weighted by expected value will save youfrom investors who never explicitly say no but merely drift away,because you\\'ll drift away from them at the same rate.  It protectsyou from investors who flake in much the same way that a distributedalgorithm protects you from processors that fail.  If some investorisn\\'t returning your emails, or wants to have lots of meetings butisn\\'t progressing toward making you an offer, you automaticallyfocus less on them.  But you have to be disciplined about assigningprobabilities.  You can\\'t let how much you want an investor influenceyour estimate of how much they want you.Know where you stand.How do you judge how well you\\'re doing with an investor, wheninvestors habitually seem more positive than they are?  By lookingat their actions rather than their words.  Every investor has sometrack they need to move along from the first conversation to wiringthe money, and you should always know what that track consists of,where you are on it, and how fast you\\'re moving forward.Never leave a meeting with an investor without asking what happensnext.  What more do they need in order to decide?  Do they needanother meeting with you?  To talk about what?  And how soon?  Dothey need to do something internally, like talk to their partners,or investigate some issue?  How long do they expect it to take?Don\\'t be too pushy, but know where you stand.  If investors arevague or resist answering such questions, assume the worst; investorswho are seriously interested in you will usually be happy to talkabout what has to happen between now and wiring the money, becausethey\\'re already running through that in their heads.If you\\'re experienced at negotiations, you already know how to asksuch questions.If you\\'re not, there\\'s a trick you can usein this situation.  Investors know you\\'re inexperienced at raisingmoney.  Inexperience there doesn\\'t make you unattractive.  Being anoob at technology would, if you\\'re starting a technology startup,but not being a noob at fundraising.  Larry and Sergey were noobsat fundraising.  So you can just confess that you\\'re inexperiencedat this and ask how their process works and where you are in it.Get the first commitment.The biggest factor in most investors\\' opinions of you is the opinionofother investors.  Once you start gettinginvestors to commit, it becomes increasingly easy to get more to.But the other side of this coin is that it\\'s often hard to get thefirst commitment.Getting the first substantial offer can be half the total difficultyof fundraising.  What counts as a substantial offer depends on whoit\\'s from and how much it is.  Money from friends and family doesn\\'tusually count, no matter how much.  But if you get $50k from a wellknown VC firm or angel investor, that will usually be enough to setthings rolling.Close committed money.It\\'s not a deal till the money\\'s in the bank.  I often hearinexperienced founders say things like \"We\\'ve raised $800,000,\"only to discover that zero of it is in the bank so far.  Rememberthe twin fears that torment investors?  The fear of missing outthat makes them jump early, and the fear of jumping onto a turdthat results?  This is a market where people are exceptionally proneto buyer\\'s remorse.  And it\\'s also one that furnishes them plentyof excuses to gratify it.  The public markets snap startup investingaround like a whip.  If the Chinese economy blows up tomorrow, allbets are off.  But there are lots of surprises for individualstartups too, and they tend to be concentrated around fundraising.Tomorrow a big competitor could appear, or you could get C&Ded, oryour cofounder could quit.Even a day\\'s delay can bring news that causes an investor to changetheir mind.  So when someone commits, get the money.  Knowing whereyou stand doesn\\'t end when they say they\\'ll invest.  After they sayyes, know what the timetable is for getting the money, and thenbabysit that process till it happens.  Institutional investors havepeople in charge of wiring money, but you may have to hunt angelsdown in person to collect a check.Inexperienced investors are the ones most likely to get buyer\\'sremorse.  Established ones have learned to treat saying yes as likediving off a diving board, and they also have more brand to preserve.But I\\'ve heard of cases of even top-tier VC firms welching on deals.Avoid investors who don\\'t \"lead.\"Since getting the first offer is most of the difficulty of fundraising,that should be part of your calculation of expected value when youstart.  You have to estimate not just the probability that aninvestor will say yes, but the probability that they\\'d be thefirstto say yes, and the latter is not simply a constant fraction of theformer.  Some investors are known for deciding quickly, and thoseare extra valuable early on.Conversely, an investor who will only invest once other investorshave is worthless initially.  And while most investors are influencedby how interested other investors are in you, there are some whohave an explicit policy of only investing after other investorshave.  You can recognize this contemptible subspecies of investorbecause they often talk about \"leads.\"  They say that they don\\'tlead, or that they\\'ll invest once you have a lead.  Sometimes theyeven claim to be willing to lead themselves, by which they meanthey won\\'t invest till you get $x from other investors.  (It\\'s greatif by \"lead\" they mean they\\'ll invest unilaterally, and in additionwill help you raise more.  What\\'s lame is when they use the termto mean they won\\'t invest unless you can raise more elsewhere.)Where does this term \"lead\" come from?  Up till a few years ago,startups raising money in phase 2 would usually raise equity roundsin which several investors invested at the same time using the samepaperwork.  You\\'d negotiate the terms with one \"lead\" investor, andthen all the others would sign the same documents and all the moneychange hands at the closing.Series A rounds still work that way, but things now work differentlyfor most fundraising prior to the series A.  Now there are rarelyactual rounds before the A round, or leads for them.  Now startupssimply raise money from investors one at a time till they feel theyhave enough.Since there are no longer leads, why do investors use that term?Because it\\'s a more legitimate-sounding way of saying what theyreally mean.  All they really mean is that their interest in youis a function of other investors\\' interest in you.  I.e. the spectralsignature of all mediocre investors.  But when phrased in terms ofleads, it sounds like there is something structural and thereforelegitimate about their behavior.When an investor tells you \"I want to invest in you, but I don\\'tlead,\" translate that in your mind to \"No, except yes if you turnout to be a hot deal.\"  And since that\\'s the default opinion of anyinvestor about any startup, they\\'ve essentially just told younothing.When you first start fundraising, the expected value of an investorwho won\\'t \"lead\" is zero, so talk to such investors last if at all.Have multiple plans.Many investors will ask how much you\\'re planning to raise. Thisquestion makes founders feel they should be planning to raise aspecific amount.  But in fact you shouldn\\'t.  It\\'s a mistake tohave fixed plans in an undertaking as unpredictable as fundraising.So why do investors ask how much you plan to raise?  For much thesame reasons a salesperson in a store will ask \"How much were youplanning to spend?\" if you walk in looking for a gift for a friend.You probably didn\\'t have a precise amount in mind; you just wantto find something good, and if it\\'s inexpensive, so much the better.The salesperson asks you this not because you\\'re supposed to havea plan to spend a specific amount, but so they can show you onlythings that cost the most you\\'ll pay.Similarly, when investors ask how much you plan to raise, it\\'s notbecause you\\'re supposed to have a plan.  It\\'s to see whether you\\'dbe a suitable recipient for the size of investment they like tomake, and also to judge your ambition, reasonableness, and how faryou are along with fundraising.If you\\'re a wizard at fundraising, you can say \"We plan to raisea $7 million series A round, and we\\'ll be accepting termsheets nexttuesday.\"  I\\'ve known a handful of founders who could pull that offwithout having VCs laugh in their faces.  But if you\\'re in theinexperienced but earnest majority, the solution is analogous tothe solution I recommend forpitchingyour startup: do the right thing and then just tell investors whatyou\\'re doing.And the right strategy, in fundraising, is to have multiple plansdepending on how much you can raise.  Ideally you should be ableto tell investors something like: we can make it to profitabilitywithout raising any more money, but if we raise a few hundredthousand we can hire one or two smart friends, and if we raise acouple million, we can hire a whole engineering team, etc.Different plans match different investors.  If you\\'re talking to aVC firm that only does series A rounds (though there are few ofthose left), it would be a waste of time talking about any but yourmost expensive plan.  Whereas if you\\'re talking to an angel whoinvests $20k at a time and you haven\\'t raised any money yet, youprobably want to focus on your least expensive plan.If you\\'re so fortunate as to have to think about the upper limiton what you should raise, a good rule of thumb is to multiply thenumber of people you want to hire times $15k times 18 months.  Inmost startups, nearly all the costs are a function of the numberof people, and $15k per month is the conventional total cost(including benefits and even office space) per person.  $15k permonth is high, so don\\'t actually spend that much.  But it\\'s ok touse a high estimate when fundraising to add a margin for error.  Ifyou have additional expenses, like manufacturing, add in those atthe end.  Assuming you have none and you think you might hire 20people, the most you\\'d want to raise is 20 x $15k x 18 = $5.4million.Underestimate how much you want.Though you can focus on different plans when talking to differenttypes of investors, you should on the whole err on the side ofunderestimating the amount you hope to raise.For example, if you\\'d like to raise $500k, it\\'s better to sayinitially that you\\'re trying to raise $250k.  Then when you reach$150k you\\'re more than half done.  That sends two useful signalsto investors: that you\\'re doing well, and that they have to decidequickly because you\\'re running out of room.  Whereas if you\\'d saidyou were raising $500k, you\\'d be less than a third done at $150k.If fundraising stalled there for an appreciable time, you\\'d startto read as a failure.Saying initially that you\\'re raising $250k doesn\\'t limit you toraising that much.  When you reach your initial target and you stillhave investor interest, you can just decide to raise more.  Startupsdo that all the time.  In fact, most startups that are very successfulat fundraising end up raising more than they originally intended.I\\'m not saying you should lie, but that you should lower yourexpectations initially.  There is almost no downside in startingwith a low number.  It not only won\\'t cap the amount you raise, butwill on the whole tend to increase it.A good metaphor here is angle of attack.  If you try to fly at toosteep an angle of attack, you just stall.  If you say right out ofthe gate that you want to raise a $5 million series A round, unlessyou\\'re in a very strong position, you not only won\\'t get that butwon\\'t get anything. Better to start at a low angle of attack, buildup speed, and then gradually increase the angle if you want.Be profitable if you can.You will be in a much stronger position if your collection of plansincludes one for raising zero dollars — i.e. if you can makeit to profitability without raising any additional money.  Ideallyyou want to be able to say to investors \"We\\'ll succeed no matterwhat, but raising money will help us do it faster.\"There are many analogies between fundraising and dating, and thisis one of the strongest.  No one wants you if you seem desperate.And the best way not to seem desperate is not tobedesperate.That\\'s one reason we urge startups during YC to keep expenses lowand to try to make it toramenprofitabilitybefore Demo Day.  Though it sounds slightlyparadoxical, if you want to raise money, the best thing you can dois get yourself to the point where you don\\'t need to.There are almost two distinct modes of fundraising: one in whichfounders who need money knock on doors seeking it, knowing thatotherwise the company will die or at the very least people willhave to be fired, and one in which founders who don\\'t need moneytake some to grow faster than they could merely on their own revenues.To emphasize the distinction I\\'m going to name them: type A fundraisingis when you don\\'t need money, and type B fundraising is when youdo.Inexperienced founders read about famous startups doing what wastype A fundraising, and decide they should raise money too, sincethat seems to be how startups work. Except when they raise moneythey don\\'t have a clear path to profitability and are thus doingtype B fundraising.  And they are then surprised how difficult andunpleasant it is.Of course not all startups can make it to ramen profitability in afew months.  And some that don\\'t still manage to have the upperhand over investors, if they have some other advantage likeextraordinary growth numbers or exceptionally formidable founders.But as time passes it gets increasingly difficult to fundraise froma position of strength without being profitable.Don\\'t optimize for valuation.When you raise money, what should your valuation be?  The mostimportant thing to understand about valuation is that it\\'s not thatimportant.Founders who raise money at high valuations tend to be unduly proudof it.  Founders are often competitive people, and since valuationis usually the only visible number attached to a startup, they endup competing to raise money at the highest valuation.  This isstupid, because fundraising is not the test that matters.  The realtest is revenue.  Fundraising is just a means to that end.  Beingproud of how well you did at fundraising is like being proud ofyour college grades.Not only is fundraising not the test that matters, valuation is noteven the thing to optimize about fundraising.  The number one thingyou want from phase 2 fundraising is to get the money you need, soyou can get back to focusing on the real test, the success of yourcompany.  Number two is good investors. Valuation is at best third.The empirical evidence shows just how unimportant it is.  Dropboxand Airbnb are the most successful companies we\\'ve funded so far,and they raised money after Y Combinator at premoney valuations of$4 million and $2.6 million respectively. Prices are so much highernow that if you can raise money at all you\\'ll probably raise it athigher valuations than Dropbox and Airbnb.  So let that satisfyyour competitiveness.  You\\'re doing better than Dropbox and Airbnb!At a test that doesn\\'t matter.When you start fundraising, your initial valuation (or valuationcap) will be set by the deal you make with the first investor whocommits.  You can increase the price for later investors, if youget a lot of interest, but by default the valuation you got fromthe first investor becomes your asking price.So if you\\'re raising money from multiple investors, as most companiesdo in phase 2, you have to be careful to avoid raising the firstfrom an over-eager investor at a price you won\\'t be able tosustain.  You can of course lower your price if you need to (inwhich case you should give the same terms to investors who investedearlier at a higher price), but you may lose a bunch of leads inthe process of realizing you need to do this.What you can do if you have eager first investors is raise moneyfrom them on an uncapped convertible note with an MFN clause.  Thisis essentially a way of saying that the valuation cap of the notewill be determined by the next investors you raise money from.It will be easier to raise money at a lower valuation.  It shouldn\\'tbe, but it is.  Since phase 2 prices vary at most 10x and the bigsuccesses generate returns of at least 100x, investors should pickstartups entirely based on their estimate of the probability thatthe company will be a big success and hardly at all on price.  Butalthough it\\'s a mistake for investors to care about price, asignificant number do.  A startup that investors seem to like butwon\\'t invest in at a cap of $x will have an easier time at $x/2.Yes/no before valuation.Some investors want to know what your valuation is before they eventalk to you about investing.  If your valuation has already beenset by a prior investment at a specific valuation or cap, you cantell them that number.  But if it isn\\'t set because you haven\\'tclosed anyone yet, and they try to push you to name a price, resistdoing so.  If this would be the first investor you\\'ve closed, thenthis could be the tipping point of fundraising. That means closingthis investor is the first priority, and you need to get theconversation onto that instead of being dragged sideways into adiscussion of price.Fortunately there is a way to avoid naming a price in this situation.And it is not just a negotiating trick; it\\'s how you (both) shouldbe operating.  Tell them that valuation is not the most importantthing to you and that you haven\\'t thought much about it, that youare looking for investors you want to partner with and who want topartner with you, and that you should talk first about whether theywant to invest at all.  Then if they decide they do want to invest,you can figure out a price. But first things first.Since valuation isn\\'t that important and getting fundraising rollingis, we usually tell founders to give the first investor who commitsas low a price as they need to.  This is a safe technique so longas you combine it with the next one.Beware \"valuation sensitive\" investors.Occasionally you\\'ll encounter investors who describe themselves as\"valuation sensitive.\"  What this means in practice is that theyare compulsive negotiators who will suck up a lot of your timetrying to push your price down.  You should therefore never approachsuch investors first. While you shouldn\\'t chase high valuations,you also don\\'t want your valuation to be set artificially low becausethe first investor who committed happened to be a compulsivenegotiator.  Some such investors have value, but the time to approachthem is near the end of fundraising, when you\\'re in a position tosay \"this is the price everyone else has paid; take it or leave it\"and not mind if they leave it.  This way, you\\'ll not only get marketprice, but it will also take less time.Ideally you know which investors have a reputation for being\"valuation sensitive\" and can postpone dealing with them till last,but occasionally one you didn\\'t know about will pop up early on.The rule of doing breadth first search weighted by expected valuealready tells you what to do in this case: slow down your interactionswith them.There are a handful of investors who will try to invest at a lowervaluation even when your price has already been set.  Lowering yourprice is a backup plan you resort to when you discover you\\'ve letthe price get set too high to close all the money you need.  Soyou\\'d only want to talk to this sort of investor if you were aboutto do that anyway.  But since investor meetings have to be arrangedat least a few days in advance and you can\\'t predict when you\\'llneed to resort to lowering your price, this means in practice thatyou should approach this type of investor last if at all.If you\\'re surprised by a lowball offer, treat it as a backup offerand delay responding to it.  When someone makes an offer in goodfaith, you have a moral obligation to respond in a reasonable time.But lowballing you is a dick move that should be met with thecorresponding countermove.Accept offers greedily.I\\'m a little leery of using the term \"greedily\" when writing aboutfundraising lest non-programmers misunderstand me, but a greedyalgorithm is simply one that doesn\\'t try to look into the future.A greedy algorithm takes the best of the options in front of itright now.  And that is how startups should approach fundraisingin phases 2 and later.  Don\\'t try to look into the future because(a) the future is unpredictable, and indeed in this business you\\'reoften being deliberately misled about it and (b) your first priorityin fundraising should be to get it finished and get back to workanyway.If someone makes you an acceptable offer, take it.  If you havemultiple incompatible offers, take the best.  Don\\'t reject anacceptable offer in the hope of getting a better one in the future.These simple rules cover a wide variety of cases.  If you\\'re raisingmoney from many investors, roll them up as they say yes.  As youstart to feel you\\'ve raised enough, the threshold for acceptablewill start to get higher.In practice offers exist for stretches of time, not points.  Sowhen you get an acceptable offer that would be incompatible withothers (e.g. an offer to invest most of the money you need), youcan tell the other investors you\\'re talking to that you have anoffer good enough to accept, and give them a few days to make theirown.  This could lose you some that might have made an offer ifthey had more time.  But by definition you don\\'t care; the initialoffer was acceptable.Some investors will try to prevent others from having time to decideby giving you an \"exploding\" offer, meaning one that\\'s only validfor a few days.  Offers from the very best investors explode lessfrequently and less rapidly — Fred Wilson never gives explodingoffers, for example — because they\\'re confident you\\'ll pickthem.  But lower-tier investors sometimes give offers with veryshort fuses, because they believe no one who had other options wouldchoose them.  A deadline of three working days is acceptable.  Youshouldn\\'t need more than that if you\\'ve been talking to investorsin parallel.  But a deadline any shorter is a sign you\\'re dealingwith a sketchy investor.  You can usually call their bluff, and youmay need to.It might seem that instead of accepting offers greedily, your goalshould be to get the best investors as partners.  That is certainlya good goal, but in phase 2 \"get the best investors\" only rarelyconflicts with \"accept offers greedily,\" because the best investorsdon\\'t usually take any longer to decide than the others.  The onlycase where the two strategies give conflicting advice is when youhave to forgo an offer from an acceptable investor to see if you\\'llget an offer from a better one.  If you talk to investors in paralleland push back on exploding offers with excessively short deadlines,that will almost never happen.  But if it does, \"get the bestinvestors\" is in the average case bad advice.  The best investorsare also the most selective, because they get their pick of all thestartups.  They reject nearly everyone they talk to, which meansin the average case it\\'s a bad trade to exchange a definite offerfrom an acceptable investor for a potential offer from a betterone.(The situation is different in phase 1.  You can\\'t apply to all theincubators in parallel, because some offset their schedules toprevent this.  In phase 1, \"accept offers greedily\" and \"get thebest investors\" do conflict, so if you want to apply to multipleincubators, you should do it in such a way that the ones you wantmost decide first.)Sometimes when you\\'re raising money from multiple investors, aseries A will emerge out of those conversations, and these ruleseven cover what to do in that case.  When an investor starts totalk to you about a series A, keep taking smaller investments tillthey actually give you a termsheet.  There\\'s no practical difficulty.If the smaller investments are on convertible notes, they\\'ll justconvert into the series A round.  The series A investor won\\'t likehaving all these other random investors as bedfellows, but if itbothers them so much they should get on with giving you a termsheet.Till they do, you don\\'t know for sure they will, and the greedyalgorithm tells you what to do.Don\\'t sell more than 25% in phase 2.If you do well, you will probably raise a series A round eventually.I say probably because things are changing with series A rounds.Startups may start to skip them.  But only one company we\\'ve fundedhas so far, so tentatively assume the path to huge passes throughan A round.Which means you should avoid doing things in earlier rounds thatwill mess up raising an A round.  For example, if you\\'ve sold morethan about 40% of your company total, it starts to get harder toraise an A round, because VCs worry there will not be enough stockleft to keep the founders motivated.Our rule of thumb is not to sell more than 25% in phase 2, on topof whatever you sold in phase 1, which should be less than 15%.  Ifyou\\'re raising money on uncapped notes, you\\'ll have to guess whatthe eventual equity round valuation might be.  Guess conservatively.(Since the goal of this rule is to avoid messing up the series A,there\\'s obviously an exception if you end up raising a series A inphase 2, as a handful of startups do.)Have one person handle fundraising.If you have multiple founders, pick one to handle fundraising sothe other(s) can keep working on the company.  And since the dangerof fundraising is not the time taken up by the actual meetings butthat it becomes the top idea in your mind, the founder who handlesfundraising should make a conscious effort to insulate the otherfounder(s) from the details of the process.(If the founders mistrust one another, this could cause some friction.But if the founders mistrust one another, you have worse problemsto worry about than how to organize fundraising.)The founder who handles fundraising should be the CEO, who shouldin turn be the most formidable of the founders.  Even if the CEOis a programmer and another founder is a salesperson?  Yes.  If youhappen to be that type of founding team, you\\'re effectively a singlefounder when it comes to fundraising.It\\'s ok to bring all the founders to meet an investor who willinvest a lot, and who needs this meeting as the final step beforedeciding.  But wait till that point.  Introducing an investor toyour cofounder(s) should be like introducing a girl/boyfriend toyour parents — something you do only when things reach a certainstage of seriousness.Even if there are still one or more founders focusing on the companyduring fundraising, growth will slow.  But try to get as much growthas you can, because fundraising is a segment of time, not a point,and what happens to the company during that time affects the outcome.If your numbers grow significantly between two investor meetings,investors will be hot to close, and if your numbers are flat ordown they\\'ll start to get cold feet.You\\'ll need an executive summary and (maybe) a deck.Traditionally phase 2 fundraising consists of presenting a slidedeck in person to investors.  Sequoia describes what such a deckshouldcontain, andsince they\\'re the customer you can take their word for it.I say \"traditionally\" because I\\'m ambivalent about decks, and (thoughperhaps this is wishful thinking) they seem to be on the way out.A lot of the most successful startups we fund never make decks inphase 2.  They just talk to investors and explain what they planto do.  Fundraising usually takes off fast for the startups thatare most successful at it, and they\\'re thus able to excuse themselvesby saying that they haven\\'t had time to make a deck.You\\'ll also want an executive summary, which should be no more thana page long and describe in the most matter of fact language whatyou plan to do, why it\\'s a good idea, and what progress you\\'ve madeso far.  The point of the summary is to remind the investor (whomay have met many startups that day) what you talked about.Assume that if you give someone a copy of your deck or executivesummary, it will be passed on to whoever you\\'d least like to haveit.  But don\\'t refuse on that account to give copies to investorsyou meet.  You just have to treat such leaks as a cost of doingbusiness.  In practice it\\'s not that high a cost.  Though foundersare rightly indignant when their plans get leaked to competitors,I can\\'t think of a startup whose outcome has been affected by it.Sometimes an investor will ask you to send them your deck and/orexecutive summary before they decide whether to meet with you.  Iwouldn\\'t do that.  It\\'s a sign they\\'re not really interested.Stop fundraising when it stops working.When do you stop fundraising?  Ideally when you\\'ve raised enough.But what if you haven\\'t raised as much as you\\'d like?  When do yougive up?It\\'s hard to give general advice about this, because there havebeen cases of startups that kept trying to raise money even whenit seemed hopeless, and miraculously succeeded. But what I usuallytell founders is to stop fundraising when you start to get a lotof air in the straw.  When you\\'re drinking through a straw, you cantell when you get to the end of the liquid because you start to geta lot of air in the straw.  When your fundraising options run out,they usually run out in the same way.  Don\\'t keep sucking on thestraw if you\\'re just getting air.  It\\'s not going to get better.Don\\'t get addicted to fundraising.Fundraising is a chore for most founders, but some find it moreinteresting than working on their startup.  The work at an earlystage startup often consists of unglamorousschleps.  Whereas fundraising, when it\\'sgoing well, can be quite the opposite.  Instead of sitting in yourgrubby apartment listening to users complain about bugs in yoursoftware, you\\'re being offered millions of dollars by famous investorsover lunch at a nice restaurant.The danger of fundraising is particularly acute for people who aregood at it.  It\\'s always fun to work on something you\\'re good at.If you\\'re one of these people, beware.  Fundraising is not whatwill make your company successful.  Listening to users complainabout bugs in your software is what will make you successful.  Andthe big danger of getting addicted to fundraising is not merelythat you\\'ll spend too long on it or raise too much money.  It\\'sthat you\\'ll start to think of yourself as being already successful,and lose your taste for the schleps you need to undertake to actuallybe successful.  Startups can be destroyed by this.When I see a startup with young founders that is fabulously successfulat fundraising, I mentally decrease my estimate of the probabilitythat they\\'ll succeed.  The press may be writing about them as ifthey\\'d been anointed as the next Google, but I\\'m thinking \"this isgoing to end badly.\"Don\\'t raise too much.Though only a handful of startups have to worry about this, it ispossible to raise too much.  The dangers of raising too much aresubtle but insidious.  One is that it will set impossibly highexpectations.  If you raise an excessive amount of money, it willbe at a high valuation, and the danger of raising money at too higha valuation is that you won\\'t be able to increase it sufficientlythe next time you raise money.A company\\'s valuation is expected to rise each time it raises money.If not it\\'s a sign of a company in trouble, which makes youunattractive to investors.  So if you raise money in phase 2 at apost-money valuation of $30 million, the pre-money valuation ofyour next round, if you want to raise one, is going to have to beat least $50 million.  And you have to be doing really, really wellto raise money at $50 million.It\\'s very dangerous to let the competitiveness of your current roundset the performance threshold you have to meet to raise your nextone, because the two are only loosely coupled.But the money itself may be more dangerous than the valuation.  Themore you raise, the more you spend, and spending a lot of money canbe disastrous for an early stage startup.  Spending a lot makes itharder to become profitable, and perhaps even worse, it makes youmore rigid, because the main way to spend money is people, and themore people you have, the harder it is to change directions.  Soif you do raise a huge amount of money, don\\'t spend it.  (You willfind that advice almost impossible to follow, so hot will be themoney burning a hole in your pocket, but I feel obliged at leastto try.)Be nice.Startups raising money occasionally alienate investors by seemingarrogant.  Sometimes because they are arrogant, and sometimes becausethey\\'re noobs clumsily attempting to mimic the toughness they\\'veobserved in experienced founders.It\\'s a mistake to behave arrogantly to investors.  While there arecertain situations in which certain investors like certain kindsof arrogance, investors vary greatly in this respect, and a flickof the whip that will bring one to heel will make another roar withindignation.  The only safe strategy is never to seem arrogant atall.That will require some diplomacy if you follow the advice I\\'ve givenhere, because the advice I\\'ve given is essentially how to playhardball back.  When you refuse to meet an investor because you\\'renot in fundraising mode, or slow down your interactions with aninvestor who moves too slow, or treat a contingent offer as the noit actually is and then, by accepting offers greedily, end up leavingthat investor out, you\\'re going to be doing things investors don\\'tlike.  So you must cushion the blow with soft words.  At YC we tellstartups they can blame us.  And now that I\\'ve written this, everyoneelse can blame me if they want.  That plus the inexperience cardshould work in most situations: sorry, we think you\\'re great, butPG said startups shouldn\\'t ___, and since we\\'re new to fundraising,we feel like we have to play it safe.The danger of behaving arrogantly is greatest when you\\'re doingwell.  When everyone wants you, it\\'s hard not to let it go to yourhead.  Especially if till recently no one wanted you.  But restrainyourself.  The startup world is a small place, and startups havelots of ups and downs.  This is a domain where it\\'s more true thanusual that pride goeth before a fall.Be nice when investors reject you as well.  The best investors arenot wedded to their initial opinion of you.  If they reject you inphase 2 and you end up doing well, they\\'ll often invest in phase3.  In fact investors who reject you are some of your warmest leadsfor future fundraising.  Any investor who spent significant timedeciding probably came close to saying yes.  Often you have someinternal champion who only needs a little more evidence to convincethe skeptics.  So it\\'s wise not merely to be nice to investors whoreject you, but (unless they behaved badly) to treat it as thebeginning of a relationship.The bar will be higher next time.Assume the money you raise in phase 2 will be the last you everraise.  You must make it to profitability on this money if you can.Over the past several years, the investment community has evolvedfrom a strategy of anointing a small number of winners early andthen supporting them for years to a strategy of spraying money atearly stage startups and then ruthlessly culling them at the nextstage.  This is probably the optimal strategy for investors.  It\\'stoo hard to pick winners early on.  Better to let the market do itfor you.  But it often comes as a surprise to startups how muchharder it is to raise money in phase 3.When your company is only a couple months old, all it has to be isa promising experiment that\\'s worth funding to see how it turnsout.  The next time you raise money, the experiment has to haveworked.  You have to be on a trajectory that leads to going public.And while there are some ideas where the proof that the experimentworked might consist of e.g. query response times, usually the proofis profitability.  Usually phase 3 fundraising has to be type Afundraising.In practice there are two ways startups hose themselves betweenphases 2 and 3.  Some are just too slow to become profitable.  Theyraise enough money to last for two years.  There doesn\\'t seem anyparticular urgency to be profitable.  So they don\\'t make any effortto make money for a year.  But by that time, not making money hasbecome habitual.  When they finally decide to try, they find theycan\\'t.The other way companies hose themselves is by letting their expensesgrow too fast.  Which almost always means hiring too many people.You usually shouldn\\'t go out and hire 8 people as soon as you raisemoney at phase 2.  Usually you want to wait till you have growth(and thus usually revenues) to justify them.  A lot of VCs willencourage you to hire aggressively.  VCs generally tell you to spendtoo much, partly because as money people they err on the side ofsolving problems by spending money, and partly because they wantyou to sell them more of your company in subsequent rounds.  Don\\'tlisten to them.Don\\'t make things complicated.I realize it may seem odd to sum up this huge treatise by sayingthat my overall advice is not to make fundraising too complicated,but if you go back and look at this list you\\'ll see it\\'s basicallya simple recipe with a lot of implications and edge cases.  Avoidinvestors till you decide to raise money, and then when you do,talk to them all in parallel, prioritized by expected value, andaccept offers greedily.  That\\'s fundraising in one sentence.  Don\\'tintroduce complicated optimizations, and don\\'t let investors introducecomplications either.Fundraising is not what will make you successful.  It\\'s just a meansto an end.  Your primary goal should be to get it over with and getback to what will make you successful — making things and talkingto users — and the path I\\'ve described will for most startupsbe the surest way to that destination.Be good, take care of yourselves, anddon\\'t leave the path.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'As E. B. White said, \"good writing is rewriting.\"  I didn\\'trealize this when I was in school.  In writing, as in math and science, they only show you the finished product.You don\\'t see all the false starts.  This gives students amisleading view of how things get made.Part of the reason it happens is that writers don\\'t want   people to see their mistakes.  But I\\'m willing to let peoplesee an early draft if it will show how much you haveto rewrite to beat an essay into shape.Below is the oldest version I can find ofThe Age of the Essay(probably the second or third day), withtext that ultimately survived inredand text that latergot deleted ingray.There seem to be several categories of cuts: things I got wrong,things that seem like bragging, flames,digressions, stretches of awkward prose, and unnecessary words.I discarded more from the beginning.  That\\'snot surprising; it takes a while to hit your stride.  Thereare more digressions at the start, because I\\'m not sure whereI\\'m heading.The amount of cutting is about average.  I probably writethree to four words for every one that appears in the finalversion of an essay.(Before anyone gets mad at me for opinions expressed here, rememberthat anything you see here that\\'s not in the final version is obviouslysomething I chose not to publish, often because I disagreewith it.)Recently a friend said that what he liked aboutmy essays was that they weren\\'t written the waywe\\'d been taught to write essays in school.  Youremember:topic sentence, introductory paragraph,supporting paragraphs, conclusion.It hadn\\'toccurred to me till then that those horrible thingswe had to write in school were even connected towhat I was doing now.  But sure enough, I thought,they did call them \"essays,\" didn\\'t they?Well, they\\'re not.  Those things you have to writein school are not only not essays, they\\'re one of themost pointless of all the pointless hoops you haveto jump through in school.  And I worry that theynot only teach students the wrong things about writing,but put them off writing entirely.So I\\'m going to give the other side of the story: whatan essay really is, and how you write one.  Or at least,how I write one.Students be forewarned: if you actually writethe kind of essay I describe, you\\'ll probably get badgrades.  But knowing how it\\'s really done shouldat least help you to understand the feeling of futilityyou have when you\\'re writing the things they tell you to.The most obvious difference between real essays andthe things one has to write in school is that realessays are not exclusively about English literature.It\\'s a fine thing for schools toteach students how towrite.But for some bizarre reason (actually, a very specific bizarrereason that I\\'ll explain in a moment),the teaching ofwriting has gotten mixed together with the studyof literature.  And so all over the country, students arewriting not about how a baseball team with a small budget might compete with the Yankees, or the role of color infashion, or what constitutes a good dessert, but aboutsymbolism in Dickens.Withobviousresults.  Only a few people reallycare aboutsymbolism in Dickens.The teacher doesn\\'t.The students don\\'t.  Most of the people who\\'ve had to write PhDdisserations about Dickens don\\'t.  And certainlyDickens himself would be more interested in an essayabout color or baseball.How did things get this way?  To answer that we have to go backalmost a thousand years.Between about 500 and 1000, life wasnot very good in Europe.  The term \"dark ages\" is presentlyout of fashion as too judgemental (the period wasn\\'t dark; it was justdifferent), but if this label didn\\'t alreadyexist, it would seem an inspired metaphor.  What littleoriginal thought there was took place in lulls betweenconstant wars and had something of the character ofthe thoughts of parents with a new baby.The most amusing thing written during thisperiod, Liudprand of Cremona\\'s Embassy to Constantinople, is,I suspect, mostly inadvertantly so.Around 1000Europe began to catch its breath.And once theyhad the luxury of curiosity,one of the first things they discoveredwaswhat we call \"the classics.\"Imagine ifwe were visited  byaliens.  If they could even get here they\\'d presumably know afew things we don\\'t.  Immediately Alien Studies would becomethe most dynamic field of scholarship: instead of painstakinglydiscovering things for ourselves, we could simply suck upeverything they\\'d discovered.  So it was in Europe in 1200.When classical texts began to circulate in Europe, they containednot just new answers, but new questions.  (If anyone proveda theorem in christian Europe before 1200, for example, thereis no record of it.)For a couple centuries, some of the most important workbeing done was intellectual archaelogy.  Those were alsothe centuries during which schools were first established.And since reading ancient texts was theessence of whatscholars didthen, it became the basis of the curriculum.By 1700,someone who wanted to learn aboutphysics didn\\'t need to start by mastering Greek in order to readAristotle.  But schoolschange slower than scholarship:the study ofancient textshad such prestige that it remainedthe backbone ofeducationuntil the late 19th century.  By then it was merely a tradition.It did serve some purposes: reading a foreign language was difficult,and thus taught discipline, or at least, kept students busy;it introduced students tocultures quite different from their own; and its very uselessnessmade it function (like white gloves) as a social bulwark.But it certainly wasn\\'ttrue, and hadn\\'t been true for centuries, that students wereserving apprenticeships in the hottest area of scholarship.Classical scholarship had also changed.  In the early era, philologyactually mattered.  The texts that filtered into Europe wereall corrupted to some degree by the errors of translators andcopyists.  Scholars had to figure out what Aristotle saidbefore they could figure out what he meant.  But by the modernera such questions were answered as well as they were evergoing to be.  And so the study of ancient texts became lessabout ancientness and more about texts.The time was then ripe for the question: if the study ofancient texts is a valid field for scholarship, why not moderntexts?  The answer, of course, is that the raison d\\'etreof classical scholarship was a kind of intellectual archaelogy thatdoes not need to be done in the case of contemporary authors.But for obvious reasons no one wanted to give that answer.The archaeological work being mostly done, it implied thatthe people studying the classics were, if not wasting theirtime, at least working on problems of minor importance.And so began the study of modern literature. There wassomeinitialresistance, but it didn\\'t last long.The limitingreagent in the growth of university departments is whatparents will let undergraduates study.  If parents will lettheir children major in x, the rest follows straightforwardly.There will be jobs teaching x, and professors to fill them.The professors will establish scholarly journals and publishone another\\'s papers.  Universities with x departments willsubscribe to the journals.  Graduate students who want jobsas professors of x will write dissertations about it.  It maytake a good long while for the more prestigious universitiesto cave in and establish departments in cheesier xes,  butat the other end of the scale there are so many universitiescompeting to attract students that the mere establishment ofa discipline requires little more than the desire to do it.High schools imitate universities.And so once universityEnglish departments were established in the late nineteenth century,the \\'riting component of the 3 Rswasmorphed into English.With the bizarre consequence that high school students nowhad to write about English literature-- to write, withouteven realizing it, imitations of whateverEnglish professors had been publishing in their journals afew decades before.   It\\'s no wonder if this seems to thestudent a pointless exercise, because we\\'re now three stepsremoved from real work: the students are imitating Englishprofessors, who are imitating classical scholars, who aremerely the inheritors of a tradition growing out of whatwas, 700 years ago, fascinating and urgently needed work.Perhaps high schools should drop English and just teach writing.The valuable part of English classes is learning to write, andthat could be taught better by itself.  Students learn betterwhen they\\'re interested in what they\\'re doing, and it\\'s hardto imagine a topic less interesting than symbolism in Dickens.Most of the people who write about that sort of thing professionallyare not really interested in it.  (Though indeed, it\\'s been awhile since they were writing about symbolism; now they\\'rewriting about gender.)I have no illusions about how eagerly this suggestion will  be adopted.  Public schools probably couldn\\'t stop teachingEnglish even if they wanted to; they\\'re probably required to bylaw.  But here\\'s a related suggestion that goes with the graininstead of against it: that universities establish awriting major.  Many of the students who now major in Englishwould major in writing if they could, and most wouldbe better off.It will be argued that it is a good thing for students to beexposed to their literary heritage.  Certainly.  But is thatmore important than that they learn to write well?  And areEnglish classes even the place to do it?  After all,the average public high school student gets zero exposure to  his artistic heritage.  No disaster results.The people who are interested in art learn about it forthemselves, and those who aren\\'t don\\'t.  I find that Americanadults are no better or worse informed about literature thanart, despite the fact that they spent years studying literaturein high school and no time at all studying art.  Which presumablymeans that what they\\'re taught in school is rounding error compared to what they pick up on their own.Indeed, English classes may even be harmful.  In my case theywere effectively aversion therapy.  Want to make someone dislikea book?  Force him to read it and write an essay about it.And make the topic so intellectually bogus that youcould not, if asked, explain why one ought to write about it.I love to read more than anything, but by the end of high schoolI never read the books we were assigned.  I was so disgusted withwhat we were doing that it became a point of honorwith me to write nonsense at least as good at the other students\\'without having more than glanced over the book to learn the namesof the characters and a few random events in it.I hoped this might be fixed in college, but I found the sameproblem there.  It was not the teachers.  It was English.   We were supposed to read novels and write essays about them.About what, and why?  That no one seemed to be able to explain.Eventually by trial and error I found that what the teacher  wanted us to do was pretend that the story had really takenplace, and to analyze based on what the characters said and did (thesubtler clues, the better) what their motives must have been.One got extra credit for motives having to do with class,as I suspect one must now for those involving gender and  sexuality.  I learned how to churn out such stuff well enoughto get an A, but I never took another English class.And the books we did these disgusting things to, like thosewe mishandled in high school, I find still have black marksagainst them in my mind.  The one saving grace was that   English courses tend to favor pompous, dull writers likeHenry James, who deserve black marks against their names anyway.One of the principles the IRS uses in deciding whether toallow deductions is that, if something is fun, it isn\\'t work.Fields that are intellectually unsure of themselves rely ona similar principle.  Reading P.G. Wodehouse or Evelyn Waugh orRaymond Chandler is too obviously pleasing to seem likeserious work, as reading Shakespeare would have been before English evolved enough to make it an effort to understand him. [sh]And so good writers (just you wait and see who\\'s still inprint in 300 years) are less likely to have readers turned   against them by clumsy, self-appointed tour guides.The other big difference between a real essay and the thingsthey make you write in school is that a real essay doesn\\'t take a position and then defend it.  That principle,like the idea that we ought to be writing about literature,   turns out to be another intellectual hangover of longforgotten origins.  It\\'s often mistakenly believed thatmedieval universities were mostly seminaries.  In fact theywere more law schools.  And at least in our traditionlawyers are advocates: they aretrained tobe able totakeeither side of an argument and make as good a case for it  as they can.Whether or not this is a good idea (in the case of prosecutors,it probably isn\\'t), it tended topervadethe atmosphere ofearly universities.  After the lecture the most common formof discussion was the disputation.  Thisideais at leastnominally preserved in our present-day thesis defense-- indeed,in the very word thesis.Most people treat the words thesisand dissertation as interchangeable, but originally, at least,a thesis was a position one took and the dissertation wasthe argument by which one defended it.I\\'m not complaining that we blur these two words together.As far as I\\'m concerned, the sooner we lose the originalsense of the word thesis, the better.  For many, perhaps most,  graduate students, it is stuffing a square peg into a roundhole to try to recast one\\'s work as a single thesis.  Andas for the disputation, that seems clearly a net lose.Arguing two sides of a casemay be a necessary evil in alegal dispute, but it\\'s not the best way to get at the truth,as I think lawyers would be the first to admit.And yet this principle is built into the very structure of  theessaysthey teach you to write in high school.  The topicsentence is your thesis, chosen in advance, the supporting paragraphs the blows you strike in the conflict, and theconclusion--- uh, what it the conclusion?  I was never sure  about that in high school.If your thesis was well expressed,what need was there to restate it?  In theory it seemed thatthe conclusion of a really good essay ought not to need to   say any more than QED.But when you understand the originsof this sort of \"essay\", you can see where theconclusion comes from.  It\\'s the concluding remarks to the jury.What other alternative is there?  To answer thatwe have toreach back into history again, though this time not so far.To Michel de Montaigne,inventor of the essay.He wasdoing something quite different from whatalawyer does,andthe difference is embodied in the name.  Essayer is the Frenchverb meaning \"to try\"(the cousin of our word assay),and an \"essai\" is aneffort.An essay is something youwritein orderto figure something out.Figure out what?  You don\\'t know yet.  And so you can\\'t begin with athesis, because you don\\'t have one, and may never have one.  An essay doesn\\'t begin with a statement, but with a  question.  In a real essay, you don\\'t take a position anddefend it.  You see a door that\\'s ajar, and you open it andwalk in to see what\\'s inside.If all you want to do is figure things out, why do you needto write anything, though?  Why not just sit and think?  Well,there precisely is Montaigne\\'s great discovery.  Expressingideas helps to form them.  Indeed, helps is far too weak aword.90%of what ends up in my essayswas stuffI onlythought of when I sat down to write them.  That\\'s why Iwrite them.So there\\'s another difference between essays andthe thingsyou have to write in school.   In schoolyou are, in theory,explaining yourself tosomeone else.  In the best case---ifyou\\'re really organized---you\\'re just writing itdown.In a real essay you\\'re writing for yourself.  You\\'rethinking out loud.But not quite.  Just as inviting people over forces you toclean up your apartment, writing something thatyou knowother people will read forces you to think well.  So itdoes matter to have an audience.  The things I\\'ve writtenjust for myself are no good.Indeed, they\\'re bad ina particular way:they tend to peter out.  When I run intodifficulties, Inotice that Itend to conclude with a few vaguequestions and then drift off to get a cup of tea.This seems a common problem.It\\'s practically the standardending in blog entries--- with the addition of a \"heh\" or an emoticon, prompted by the all too accurate sense thatsomething is missing.And indeed, a lot ofpublished essays peter out inthissame way.Particularly the sort written by the staff writers of newsmagazines.  Outside writers tend to supplyeditorials of the defend-a-position variety, whichmake a beeline toward a rousing (andforeordained) conclusion.   But the staff writers feelobliged to write somethingmorebalanced, which inpractice ends up meaning blurry.Since they\\'rewriting for a popular magazine, they start with themost radioactively controversial questions, from which(because they\\'re writing for a popular magazine)they then proceed to recoilfromin terror.Gay marriage,for oragainst?  This group says one thing.  That group saysanother.  One thing is certain: the question is acomplex one.  (But don\\'t get mad at us.  We didn\\'tdraw any conclusions.)Questions aren\\'t enough.  An essay has to come up with answers.They don\\'t always, of course.  Sometimes you start with a  promising question and get nowhere.  But those you don\\'tpublish.  Those are like experiments that get inconclusiveresults.   Something you publish ought to tell the reader  something he didn\\'t already know.Butwhatyou tell him doesn\\'t matter, so long as   it\\'s interesting.  I\\'m sometimes accused of meandering.In defend-a-position writing that would be a flaw.There you\\'re not concerned with truth.  You alreadyknow where you\\'re going, and you want to go straight there,blustering through obstacles, and hand-wavingyour way across swampy ground.  But that\\'s not whatyou\\'re trying to do in an essay.  An essay is supposed tobe a search for truth.  It would be suspicious if it didn\\'tmeander.The Meander is a river inAsia Minor (akaTurkey).As you might expect, it winds all over the place.Butdoes itdo this out of frivolity?   Quite the opposite.Like all rivers, it\\'s rigorously following the laws of physics.The path it has discovered,winding as it is, representsthe most economical route to the sea.The river\\'s algorithm is simple.  At each step, flow down.For the essayist this translates to: flow interesting.Of all the places to go next, choosewhichever seemsmost interesting.I\\'m pushing this metaphor a bit.  An essayistcan\\'t havequite as little foresight as a river.In fact what you do(or what I do) is somewhere between a river and a romanroad-builder.  I have a general idea of the directionI want to go in, andI choose the next topic with that in mind.  This essay isabout writing, so I do occasionally yank it back in thatdirection, but it is not all the sort of essay Ithought I was going to write about writing.Note too that hill-climbing (which is what this algorithm iscalled) can get you in trouble.Sometimes,justlike a river,yourun up against a blank wall.WhatI dothen is justwhat the river does: backtrack.At one point in this essayI found that after following a certain thread I ran outof ideas.  I had to go backnparagraphs and start overin another direction.For illustrative purposes I\\'ve leftthe abandoned branch as a footnote.Err on the side of the river.  An essay is not a referencework.  It\\'s not something you read looking for a specificanswer, and feel cheated if you don\\'t find it.  I\\'d muchrather read an essay that went off in an unexpected butinteresting direction than one that plodded dutifully alonga prescribed course.So what\\'s interesting?  For me, interesting means surprise.Design, asMatzhas said, should follow the principle ofleastsurprise.A button that looks like it will make amachine stop should make it stop, not speed up.  Essaysshould do the opposite.  Essays should aim for maximumsurprise.I was afraid of flying for a long time and could only travelvicariously.  When friends came back from faraway places,it wasn\\'t just out of politeness that I asked themabouttheir trip.I really wanted to know.  And I foundthatthe best way to get information out of them was to askwhat surprised them.  How was the place different from whatthey expected?  This is an extremely useful question.You can ask it ofeventhe most unobservant people, and it willextract information they didn\\'t even know they wererecording.Indeed, you can ask it in real time.  Now when I go somewherenew, I make a note of what surprises me about it.  Sometimes Ieven make a conscious effort to visualize the place beforehand,so I\\'ll have a detailed image to diff with reality.Surprises arefactsyou didn\\'talreadyknow.Butthey\\'remore than that.  They\\'re factsthat contradict things youthought you knew.  And so they\\'re the most valuable sort offact you can get.  They\\'re like a food that\\'s not merelyhealthy, but counteracts the unhealthy effects of thingsyou\\'ve already eaten.How do you find surprises?  Well, therein lies halfthe work of essay writing.  (The other half is expressingyourself well.)You can at leastuse yourself as aproxy for the reader.  You should only write about thingsyou\\'ve thought about a lot.  And anything you come acrossthat surprises you, who\\'ve thought about the topic a lot,will probably surprise most readers.For example, in a recent essay I pointed out that becauseyou can only judge computer programmers by working withthem, no one knowsin programming who the heroes shouldbe.Icertainlydidn\\'t realize this when Istarted writingtheessay, and even now I find it kind of weird.  That\\'swhat you\\'re looking for.So if you want to write essays, you need two ingredients:you needa few topics that you think about a lot, andyouneedsome ability to ferret out the unexpected.What should you think about?  My guess is that itdoesn\\'t matter.  Almost everything isinteresting if you get deeplyenough into it.Theone possible exceptionarethingslike working in fast food,whichhave deliberately had allthe variation sucked out of them.In retrospect, was thereanything interesting about working in Baskin-Robbins?Well, it was interestingto noticehow important color wasto the customers.  Kids a certain age would point intothe case and say that they wanted yellow.  Did they wantFrench Vanilla or Lemon?  They would just look at youblankly.  They wanted yellow.  And then there was themystery of why the perennial favorite Pralines n\\' Creamwas so appealing. I\\'m inclined now tothink it was the salt.And the mystery of why Passion Fruit tasted so disgusting.People would order it because of the name, and were alwaysdisappointed.  It should have been called In-sink-eratorFruit.Andthere wasthe difference in the way fathers andmothers bought ice cream for their kids.Fatherstended toadopt the attitude ofbenevolent kings bestowing largesse,andmothersthat ofharriedbureaucrats,giving in topressureagainst their better judgement.So, yes, there does seem to be material, even infast food.What about the other half, ferreting out the unexpected?That may require some natural ability.  I\\'ve noticed fora long time that I\\'m pathologically observant.  ....[That was as far as I\\'d gotten at the time.]'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'As a child I read a book of stories about a famous judge in eighteenthcentury Japan called Ooka Tadasuke.  One of the cases he decidedwas brought by the owner of a food shop.  A poor student who couldafford only rice was eating his rice while enjoying the deliciouscooking smells coming from the food shop.  The owner wanted thestudent to pay for the smells he was enjoying.The student wasstealing his smells!This story often comes to mind when I hear the RIAA and MPAA accusingpeople of stealing music and movies.It sounds ridiculous to us to treat smells as property.  But I canimagine scenarios in which one could charge for smells.  Imaginewe were living on a moon base where we had to buy air by theliter.  I could imagine air suppliers adding scents at an extracharge.The reason it seems ridiculous to us to treat smells as propertyis that it wouldn\\'t work to.  It would work on a moon base, though.What counts as property depends on what works to treat as property.And that not only can change, but has changed.  Humans may always(for some definition of human and always) have treated small itemscarried on one\\'s person as property.  But hunter gatherers didn\\'ttreat land, for example, as property in the way we do.The reason so many people think of property as having a singleunchanging definition is that its definition changes very slowly.But we are in the midst of such a change now.  The recordlabels and movie studios used to distribute what they made like airshipped through tubes on a moon base.  But with the arrival ofnetworks, it\\'s as if we\\'ve moved to a planet with a breathableatmosphere.  Data moves like smells now.  And through a combinationof wishful thinking and short-term greed, the labels and studioshave put themselves in the position of the food shop owner, accusingus all of stealing their smells.(The reason I say short-term greed is that the underlying problemwith the labels and studios is that the people who run them aredriven by bonuses rather than equity.  If they were driven by equitythey\\'d be looking for ways to take advantage of technological changeinstead of fighting it.  But building new things takes too long.Their bonuses depend on this year\\'s revenues, and the best way toincrease those is to extract more money from stuff they do already.)So what does this mean?  Should people not be able to charge forcontent?  There\\'s not a single yes or no answer to that question.People should be able to charge for content when it works to chargefor content.But by \"works\" I mean something more subtle than \"when they can getaway with it.\"  I mean when people can charge for content withoutwarping society in order to do it.  After all, the companies sellingsmells on the moon base could continue to sell them on the Earth,if they lobbied successfully for laws requiring us all to continueto breathe through tubes down here too, even though we no longerneeded to.The crazy legal measures that the labels and studios have beentaking have a lot of that flavor.  Newspapers and magazines arejust as screwed, but they are at least declining gracefully.  TheRIAA and MPAA would make us breathe through tubes if they could.Ultimately it comes down to common sense.  When you\\'re abusing thelegal system by trying to use mass lawsuits against randomly chosenpeople as a form of exemplary punishment, or lobbying for lawsthat would break the Internet if they passed, that\\'s ipso factoevidence you\\'re using a definition of property that doesn\\'t work.This is where it\\'s helpful to have working democracies and multiplesovereign countries.  If the world had a single, autocratic government,the labels and studios could buy laws making the definition ofproperty be whatever they wanted.  But fortunately there are stillsome countries that are not copyright colonies of the US, and evenin the US,politiciansstill seem to be afraid of actual voters, in sufficient numbers.The people running the US may not like it when voters or othercountries refuse to bend to their will, but ultimately it\\'s in allour interest that there\\'s not a single point of attack for peopletrying to warp the law to serve their own purposes.  Private propertyis an extremely useful idea — arguably one of our greatest inventions.So far, each new definition of it has brought us increasing materialwealth.It seems reasonable to suppose the newest one willtoo.  It would be a disaster if we all had to keep running anobsolete version just because a few powerful people were too lazyto upgrade.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': \"It would work for a while, and then I'd gradually find myselfusing the Internet on my work computer.  I'm trying otherstrategies now, but I think this time I'll wait till I'm surethey work before writing about them.May 2008Procrastination feeds on distractions.  Most people find ituncomfortable just to sit and do nothing; you avoid work by doingsomething else.So one way to beat procrastination is to starve it of distractions.But that's not as straightforward as it sounds, because there arepeople working hard to distract you.  Distraction is not a staticobstacle that you avoid like you might avoid a rock in the road.Distraction seeks you out.Chesterfield described dirt as matter out of place.  Distractingis, similarly, desirable at the wrong time.  And technology iscontinually being refined to produce more and more desirable things.Which means that as we learn to avoid one class of distractions,new ones constantly appear, like drug-resistant bacteria.Television, for example, has after 50 years of refinement reachedthe point where it's like visual crack.  I realized when I was 13that TV was addictive, so I stopped watching it.  But I read recently that the average American watches4 hoursof TV a day.  A quarterof their life.TV is in decline now, but only because people have found even moreaddictive ways of wasting time.  And what's especially dangerousis that many happen at your computer.  This is no accident.  Anever larger percentage of office workers sit in front of computersconnected to the Internet, and distractions always evolve towardthe procrastinators.I remember when computers were, for me at least, exclusively forwork.  I might occasionally dial up a server to get mail or ftpfiles, but most of the time I was offline.  All I could do was writeand program.  Now I feel as if someone snuck a television onto mydesk.  Terribly addictive things are just a click away.  Run intoan obstacle in what you're working on?  Hmm, I wonder what's newonline.  Better check.After years of carefully avoiding classic time sinks like TV, games,and Usenet, I still managed to fall prey to distraction, becauseI didn't realize that it evolves.  Something that used to be safe,using the Internet, gradually became more and more dangerous.  Somedays I'd wake up, get a cup of tea and check the news, then checkemail, then check the news again, then answer a few emails, thensuddenly notice it was almost lunchtime and I hadn't gotten any realwork done.  And this started to happen more and more often.It took me surprisingly long to realize how distracting the Internethad become, because the problem was intermittent.  I ignored it theway you let yourself ignore a bug that only appears intermittently.  WhenI was in the middle of a project, distractions weren't really aproblem.  It was when I'd finished one project and was decidingwhat to do next that they always bit me.Another reason it was hard to notice the danger of this new typeof distraction was that social customs hadn't yet caught up withit.  If I'd spent a whole morning sitting on a sofa watching TV,I'd have noticed very quickly.  That's a known danger sign, likedrinking alone.  But using the Internet still looked and felt a lot like work.Eventually, though, it became clear that the Internet had become so muchmore distracting that I had to start treating it differently.Basically, I had to add a new application to my list of known timesinks: Firefox.* * *The problem is a hard one to solve because most people still needthe Internet for some things.  If you drink too much, you can solvethat problem by stopping entirely.  But you can't solve the problemof overeating by stopping eating.  I couldn't simply avoid the Internet entirely, as I'd done with previous time sinks.At first I tried rules.  For example, I'd tell myself I was onlygoing to use the Internet twice a day.  But these schemes neverworked for long.  Eventually something would come up that requiredme to use it more than that.  And then I'd gradually slip backinto my old ways.Addictive things have to be treated as if they were sentientadversaries—as if there were a little man in your head alwayscooking up the most plausible arguments for doing whatever you'retrying to stop doing.  If you leave a path to it, he'll find it.The key seems to be visibility.  The biggest ingredient in most bad habitsis denial.  So you have to make it so that you can't merelyslipinto doing the thing you're trying to avoid.  It has to set offalarms.Maybe in the long term the right answer for dealing with Internetdistractions will besoftwarethat watches and controls them.  Butin the meantime I've found a more drastic solution that definitelyworks: to set up a separate computer for using the Internet.I now leave wifi turned off on my main computer except when I needto transfer a file or edit a web page, and I have a separate laptop on the other sideof the room that I use to check mail or browse the web.  (Irony ofironies, it's the computer Steve Huffman wrote Reddit on.  WhenSteve and Alexis auctioned off their old laptops for charity, Ibought them for the Y Combinator museum.)My rule is that I can spend as much time online as I want, as longas I do it on that computer.  And this turns out to be enough.  WhenI have to sit on the other side of the room to check email or browsethe web, I become much more aware of it.  Sufficiently aware, inmy case at least, that it's hard to spend more than about an houra day online.And my main computer is now freed for work.  If you try this trick,you'll probably be struck by how different it feels when yourcomputer is disconnected from the Internet.  It was alarming to mehow foreign it felt to sit in front of a computer that couldonly be used for work, because that showed how much time I musthave been wasting.Wow.  All I can do at this computer is work.  Ok, I better workthen.That's the good part.  Your old bad habits now help you to work.You're used to sitting in front of that computer for hours at atime.   But you can't browse the web or check email now.  What areyou going to do?  You can't just sit there.  So you start working.Good and Bad ProcrastinationSpanish TranslationArabic TranslationCatalan TranslationRussian TranslationSpanish Translation\"},\n",

The lessenergy they expend on your prose, the more they\\'ll have left foryour ideas.And the further they\\'ll read. Most readers\\' energy tends to flagpart way through an article or essay. If the friction of readingis low enough, more keep going till the end.There\\'s an Italian dish calledsaltimbocca, which means \"leapinto the mouth.\" My goal when writing might be calledsaltintesta:the ideas leap into your head and you barely notice the words thatgot them there.It\\'s too much to hope that writing could ever be pure ideas. Youmight not even want it to be. But for most writers, most of thetime, that\\'s the goal to aim for. The gap between most writing andpure ideas is not filled with poetry.Plus it\\'s more considerate to write simply. When you write in afancy way to impress people, you\\'re making them do extra work justso you can seem cool. It\\'s like trailing a long train behind youthat readers have to carry.And remember, if you\\'re writing in English, that a lot of yourreaders won\\'t be native English speakers. Their understanding ofideas may be way ahead of their understanding of English. So youcan\\'t assume that writing about a difficult topic means you canuse difficult words.Of course, fancy writing doesn\\'t just conceal ideas. It can alsoconceal the lack of them. That\\'s why some people write that way,to conceal the fact that they havenothing to say. Whereas writingsimply keeps you honest. If you say nothing simply, it will beobvious to everyone, including you.Simple writing also lasts better. People reading your stuff in thefuture will be in much the same position as people from othercountries reading it today. The culture and the language will havechanged. It\\'s not vain to care about that, any more than it\\'s vainfor a woodworker to build a chair to last.Indeed, lasting is not merely an accidental quality of chairs, orwriting. It\\'s a sign you did a good job.But although these are all real advantages of writing simply, noneof them are why I do it. The main reason I write simply is that itoffends me not to.

       "  'essay_text': 'When people care enough about something to do it well, those whodo it best tend to be far better than everyone else.  There\\'s ahuge gap between Leonardo and second-rate contemporaries likeBorgognone.  You see the same gap between Raymond Chandler and theaverage writer of detective novels.  A top-ranked professional chessplayer could play ten thousand games against an ordinary club playerwithout losing once.Like chess or painting or writing novels, making money is a veryspecialized skill.   But for some reason we treat this skilldifferently.  No one complains when a few people surpass all therest at playing chess or writing novels, but when a few people makemore money than the rest, we get editorials saying this is wrong.Why?  The pattern of variation seems no different than for any otherskill.  What causes people to react so strongly when the skill ismaking money?I think there are three reasons we treat making money as different:the misleading model of wealth we learn as children; the disreputableway in which, till recently, most fortunes were accumulated; andthe worry that great variations in income are somehow bad forsociety.  As far as I can tell, the first is mistaken, the secondoutdated, and the third empirically false.  Could it be that, in amodern democracy, variation in income is actually a sign of health?The Daddy Model of WealthWhen I was five I thought electricity was created by electricsockets.  I didn\\'t realize there were power plants out theregenerating it.  Likewise, it doesn\\'t occur to most kids that wealthis something that has to be generated.  It seems to be somethingthat flows from parents.Because of the circumstances in which they encounter it, childrentend to misunderstand wealth.  They confuse it with money.  Theythink that there is a fixed amount of it.  And they think of it assomething that\\'s distributed by authorities (and so should bedistributed equally), rather than something that has to be created(and might be created unequally).In fact, wealth is not money.  Money is just a convenient way oftrading one form of wealth for another.  Wealth is the underlyingstuff—the goods and services we buy.  When you travel to arich or poor country, you don\\'t have to look at people\\'s bankaccounts to tell which kind you\\'re in.  You canseewealth—in buildings and streets, in the clothes and the healthof the people.Where does wealth come from?  People make it.  This was easier tograsp when most people lived on farms, and made many of the thingsthey wanted with their own hands.  Then you could see in the house,the herds, and the granary the wealth that each family created.  Itwas obvious then too that the wealth of the world was not a fixedquantity that had to be shared out, like slices of a pie.  If youwanted more wealth, you could make it.This is just as true today, though few of us create wealth directlyfor ourselves (except for a few vestigial domestic tasks).  Mostlywe create wealth for other people in exchange for money, which wethen trade for the forms of wealth we want.Because kids are unable to create wealth, whatever they have hasto be given to them.  And when wealth is something you\\'re given,then of course it seems that it should be distributed equally.As in most families it is.  The kids see to that.  \"Unfair,\" theycry, when one sibling gets more than another.In the real world, you can\\'t keep living off your parents.  If youwant something, you either have to make it, or do something ofequivalent value for someone else, in order to get them to give youenough money to buy it.  In the real world, wealth is (except fora few specialists like thieves and speculators) something you haveto create, not something that\\'s distributed by Daddy.  And sincethe ability and desire to create it vary from person to person,it\\'s not made equally.You get paid by doing or making something people want, and thosewho make more money are often simply better at doing what peoplewant.  Top actors make a lot more money than B-list actors.  TheB-list actors might be almost as charismatic, but when people goto the theater and look at the list of movies playing, they wantthat extra oomph that the big stars have.Doing what people want is not the only way to get money, of course.You could also rob banks, or solicit bribes, or establish a monopoly.Such tricks account for some variation in wealth, and indeed forsome of the biggest individual fortunes, but they are not the rootcause of variation in income.  The root cause of variation in income,as Occam\\'s Razor implies, is the same as the root cause of variationin every other human skill.In the United States, the CEO of a large public company makes about100 times as much as the average person.Basketball playersmake about 128 times as much, and baseball players 72 times as much.Editorials quote this kind of statistic with horror.  But I haveno trouble imagining that one person could be 100 times as productiveas another.  In ancient Rome the price ofslavesvaried bya factor of 50 depending on their skills.And that\\'s withoutconsidering motivation, or the extra leverage in productivity thatyou can get from modern technology.Editorials about athletes\\' or CEOs\\' salaries remind me of earlyChristian writers, arguing from first principles about whether theEarth was round, when they could just walk outside and check.How much someone\\'s work is worth is not a policy question.  It\\'ssomething the market already determines.\"Are they really worth 100 of us?\" editorialists ask.  Depends onwhat you mean by worth.  If you mean worth in the sense of whatpeople will pay for their skills, the answer is yes, apparently.A few CEOs\\' incomes reflect some kind of wrongdoing.  But are therenot others whose incomes really do reflect the wealth they generate?Steve Jobs saved a company that was in a terminal decline.  And notmerely in the way a turnaround specialist does, by cutting costs;he had to decide what Apple\\'s next products should be.  Few otherscould have done it.  And regardless of the case with CEOs, it\\'shard to see how anyone could argue that the salaries of professionalbasketball players don\\'t reflect supply and demand.It may seem unlikely in principle that one individual could reallygenerate so much more wealth than another.  The key to this mysteryis to revisit that question, are they really worth 100 of us?Woulda basketball team trade one of their players for 100random people?  What would Apple\\'s next product look like if youreplaced Steve Jobs with a committee of 100 random people?Thesethings don\\'t scale linearly.  Perhaps the CEO or the professionalathlete has only ten times (whatever that means) the skill anddetermination of an ordinary person.  But it makes all the differencethat it\\'s concentrated in one individual.When we say that one kind of work is overpaid and another underpaid,what are we really saying?  In a free market, prices are determinedby what buyers want.  People like baseball more than  poetry, sobaseball players make more than poets.  To say that a certain kindof work is underpaid is thus identical with saying that people wantthe wrong things.Well, of course people want the wrong things.  It seems odd to besurprised by that.  And it seems even odder to say that it\\'sunjustthat certain kinds of work are underpaid.Thenyou\\'re saying that it\\'s unjust that people want the wrong things.It\\'s  lamentable that people prefer reality TV and corndogs toShakespeare and steamed vegetables, but unjust?  That seems likesaying that blue is heavy, or that up is circular.The appearance of the word \"unjust\" here is the unmistakable spectralsignature of the Daddy Model.  Why else would this idea occur inthis odd context?  Whereas if the speaker were still operating onthe Daddy Model, and saw wealth as something that flowed from acommon source and had to be shared out, rather than somethinggenerated by doing what other people wanted, this is exactly whatyou\\'d get on noticing that some people made much more than others.When we talk about \"unequal distribution of income,\" we shouldalso ask, where does that income come from?Who made the wealthit represents?  Because to the extent that income varies simplyaccording to how much wealth people create, the distribution maybe unequal, but it\\'s hardly unjust.Stealing ItThe second reason we tend to find great disparities of wealthalarming is that for most of human history the usual way to accumulatea fortune was to steal it: in pastoral societies by cattle raiding;in agricultural societies by appropriating others\\' estates in timesof war, and taxing them in times of peace.In conflicts, those on the winning side would receive the estatesconfiscated from the losers.  In England in the 1060s, when Williamthe Conqueror distributed the estates of the defeated Anglo-Saxonnobles to his followers, the conflict was military.  By the 1530s,when Henry VIII distributed the estates of the monasteries to hisfollowers, it was mostly political.But the principle was thesame.  Indeed, the same principle is at work now in Zimbabwe.In more organized societies, like China, the ruler and his officialsused taxation instead of confiscation.  But here too we see thesame principle: the way to get rich was not to create wealth, butto serve a ruler powerful enough to appropriate it.This started to change in Europe with the rise of the middle class.Now we think of the middle class as people who are neither rich norpoor, but originally they were a distinct group.  In a feudalsociety, there are just two classes: a warrior aristocracy, and theserfs who work their estates.  The middle class were a new, thirdgroup who lived in towns and supported themselves by manufacturingand trade.Starting in the tenth and eleventh centuries, petty nobles andformer serfs banded together in towns that gradually became powerfulenough to ignore the local feudal lords.Like serfs, the middleclass made a living largely by creating wealth.  (In port citieslike Genoa and Pisa, they also engaged in piracy.) But unlike serfsthey had an incentive to create a lot of it.  Any wealth a serfcreated belonged to his master.  There was not much point in makingmore than you could hide.  Whereas the independence of the townsmenallowed them to keep whatever wealth they created.Once it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, society asa whole started to get richer very rapidly.  Nearly everything wehave was created by the middle class.  Indeed, the other two classeshave effectively disappeared in industrial societies, and theirnames been given to either end of the middle class.  (In the originalsense of the word, Bill Gates is middle class.)But it was not till the Industrial Revolution that wealth creationdefinitively replaced corruption as the best way to get rich.  InEngland, at least, corruption only became unfashionable (and infact only started to be called \"corruption\") when there started tobe other, faster ways to get rich.Seventeenth-century England was much like the third world today,in that government office was a recognized route to wealth.  Thegreat fortunes of that time still derived more from what we wouldnow call corruption than from commerce.By the nineteenthcentury that had changed.  There continued to be bribes, as therestill are everywhere, but politics had by then been left to men whowere driven more by vanity than greed.  Technology had made itpossible to create wealth faster than you could steal it.  Theprototypical rich man of the nineteenth century was not a courtierbut an industrialist.With the rise of the middle class, wealth stopped being a zero-sumgame.  Jobs and Wozniak didn\\'t have to make us poor to make themselvesrich.  Quite the opposite: they created things that made our livesmaterially richer.  They had to, or we wouldn\\'t have paid for them.But since for most of the world\\'s history the main route to wealthwas to steal it, we tend to be suspicious of rich people.  Idealisticundergraduates find their unconsciously preserved child\\'s model ofwealth confirmed by eminent writers of the past.  It is a case ofthe mistaken meeting the outdated.\"Behind every great fortune, there is a crime,\" Balzac wrote.  Excepthe didn\\'t.  What he actually said was that a great fortune with noapparent cause was probably due to a crime well enough executedthat it had been forgotten.  If we were talking about Europe in1000, or most of the third world today, the standard misquotationwould be spot on.  But Balzac lived in nineteenth-century France,where the Industrial Revolution was well advanced.  He knew youcould make a fortune without stealing it.  After all, he did himself,as a popular novelist.Only a few countries (by no coincidence, the richest ones) havereached this stage.  In most, corruption still has the upper hand.In most, the fastest way to get wealth is by stealing it.  And sowhen we see increasing differences in income in a rich country,there is a tendency to worry that it\\'s sliding back toward becominganother Venezuela.  I think the opposite is happening. I thinkyou\\'re seeing a country a full step ahead of Venezuela.The Lever of TechnologyWill technology increase the gap between rich and poor?  It willcertainly increase the gap between the productive and the unproductive.That\\'s the whole point of technology.   With a tractor an energeticfarmer could plow six times as much land in a day as he could witha team of horses.  But only if he mastered a new kind of farming.I\\'ve seen the lever of technology grow visibly in my own time.  Inhigh school I made money by mowing lawns and scooping ice cream atBaskin-Robbins.  This was the only kind of work available at thetime.  Now high school kids could write software or design websites.  But only some of them will; the rest will still be scoopingice cream.I remember very vividly when in 1985 improved technology made itpossible for me to buy a computer of my own.  Within months I wasusing it to make money as a freelance programmer.  A few yearsbefore, I couldn\\'t have done this.  A few years before, there wasno suchthingas a freelance programmer.  But Apple createdwealth, in the form of powerful, inexpensive computers, and programmersimmediately set to work using it to create more.As this example suggests, the rate at which technology increasesour productive capacity is probably exponential, rather than linear.So we should expect to see ever-increasing variation in individualproductivity as time goes on.   Will that increase the gap betweenrich and the poor?  Depends which gap you mean.Technology should increase the gap in income, but it seems todecrease other gaps.  A hundred years ago, the rich led a differentkindof life from ordinary people.  They lived in housesfull of servants, wore elaborately uncomfortable clothes, andtravelled about in carriages drawn by teams of horses which themselvesrequired their own houses and servants.  Now, thanks to technology,the rich live more like the average person.Cars are a good example of why.  It\\'s possible to buy expensive,handmade cars that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.  But thereis not much point.  Companies make more money by building a largenumber of ordinary cars than a small number of expensive ones.  Soa company making a mass-produced car can afford to spend a lot moreon its design.  If you buy a custom-made car, something will alwaysbe breaking.  The only point of buying one now is to advertise thatyou can.Or consider watches.  Fifty years ago, by spending a lot of moneyon a watch you could get better performance.  When watches hadmechanical movements, expensive watches kept better time.  Not anymore.  Since the invention of the quartz movement, an ordinary Timexis more accurate than a Patek Philippe costing hundreds of thousandsof dollars.Indeed, as with expensive cars, if you\\'re determinedto spend a lot of money on a watch, you have to put up with someinconvenience to do it: as well as keeping worse time, mechanicalwatches have to be wound.The only thing technology can\\'t cheapen is brand.  Which is preciselywhy we hear ever more about it.  Brand is the residue left as thesubstantive differences between rich and poor evaporate.  But whatlabel you have on your stuff is a much smaller matter than havingit versus not having it.  In 1900, if you kept a carriage, no oneasked what year or brand it was.  If you had one, you were rich.And if you weren\\'t rich, you took the omnibus or walked.  Now eventhe poorest Americans drive cars, and it is only because we\\'re sowell trained by advertising that we can even recognize the especiallyexpensive ones.The same pattern has played out in industry after industry.  Ifthere is enough demand for something, technology will make it cheapenough to sell in large volumes, and the mass-produced versionswill be, if not better, at least more convenient.And thereis nothing the rich like more than convenience.  The rich people Iknow drive the same cars, wear the same clothes, have the same kindof furniture, and eat the same foods as my other friends.  Theirhouses are in different neighborhoods, or if in the same neighborhoodare different sizes, but within them life is similar.  The housesare made using the same construction techniques and contain muchthe same objects.  It\\'s inconvenient to do something expensive andcustom.The rich spend their time more like everyone else too.  BertieWooster seems long gone.  Now, most people who are rich enough notto work do anyway.  It\\'s not just social pressure that makes them;idleness is lonely and demoralizing.Nor do we have the social distinctions there were a hundred yearsago.   The novels and etiquette manuals of that period read nowlike descriptions of some strange tribal society.  \"With respectto the continuance of friendships...\" hintsMrs. Beeton\\'s Bookof Household Management(1880), \"it may be found necessary, insome cases, for a mistress to relinquish, on assuming the responsibilityof a household, many of those commenced in the earlier part of herlife.\" A woman who married a rich man was expected to drop friendswho didn\\'t.  You\\'d seem a barbarian if you behaved that way today.You\\'d also have a very boring life.  People still tend to segregatethemselves somewhat, but much more on the basis of education thanwealth.Materially and socially, technology seems to be decreasing the gapbetween the rich and the poor, not increasing it.  If Lenin walkedaround the offices of a company like Yahoo or Intel or Cisco, he\\'dthink communism had won.  Everyone would be wearing the same clothes,have the same kind of office (or rather, cubicle) with the samefurnishings, and address one another by their first names insteadof by honorifics.  Everything would seem exactly as he\\'d predicted,until he looked at their bank accounts.  Oops.Is it a problem if technology increases that gap?  It doesn\\'t seemto be so far.  As it increases the gap in income, it seems todecrease most other gaps.Alternative to an AxiomOne often hears a policy criticized on the grounds that it wouldincrease the income gap between rich and poor.  As if it were anaxiom that this would be bad.  It might be true that increasedvariation in income would be bad, but I don\\'t see how we can sayit\\'saxiomatic.Indeed, it may even be false, in industrial democracies.  In asociety of serfs and warlords, certainly, variation in income is asign of an underlying problem.  But serfdom is not the only causeof variation in income.  A 747 pilot doesn\\'t make 40 times as muchas a checkout clerk because he is a warlord who somehow holds herin thrall.  His skills are simply much more valuable.I\\'d like to propose an alternative idea: that in a modern society,increasing variation in income is a sign of health.  Technologyseems to increase the variation in productivity at faster thanlinear rates.  If we don\\'t see corresponding variation in income,there are three possible explanations: (a) that technical innovationhas stopped, (b) that the people who would create the most wealtharen\\'t doing it, or (c) that they aren\\'t getting paid for it.I think we can safely say that (a) and (b) would be bad.  If youdisagree, try living for a year using only the resources availableto the average Frankish nobleman in 800, and report back to us.(I\\'ll be generous and not send you back to the stone age.)The only option, if you\\'re going to have an increasingly prosperoussociety without increasing variation in income, seems to be (c),that people will create a lot of wealth without being paid for it.That Jobs and Wozniak, for example, will cheerfully work 20-hourdays to produce the Apple computer for a society that allows them,after taxes, to keep just enough of their income to match what theywould have made working 9 to 5 at a big company.Will people create wealth if they can\\'t get paid for it?  Only ifit\\'s fun.  People will write operating systems for free.  But theywon\\'t install them, or take support calls, or train customers touse them.  And at least 90% of the work that even the highest techcompanies do is of this second, unedifying kind.All the unfun kinds of wealth creation slow dramatically in a societythat confiscates private fortunes.  We can confirm this empirically.Suppose you hear a strange noise that you think may be due to anearby fan.  You turn the fan off, and the noise stops.  You turnthe fan back on, and the noise starts again.  Off, quiet.  On,noise.  In the absence of other information, it would seem the noiseis caused by the fan.At various times and places in history, whether you could accumulatea fortune by creating wealth has been turned on and off.  NorthernItaly in 800, off (warlords would steal it).  Northern Italy in1100, on.  Central France in 1100, off (still feudal).  England in1800, on.  England in 1974, off (98% tax on investment income).United States in 1974, on.  We\\'ve even had a twin study: WestGermany, on;  East Germany, off.  In every case, the creation ofwealth seems to appear and disappear like the noise of a fan as youswitch on and off the prospect of keeping it.There is some momentum involved.  It probably takes at least ageneration to turn people into East Germans (luckily for England).But if it were merely a fan we were studying, without all the extrabaggage that comes from the controversial topic of wealth, no onewould have any doubt that the fan was causing the noise.If you suppress variations in income, whether by stealing privatefortunes, as feudal rulers used to do, or by taxing them away, assome modern governments have done, the result always seems to bethe same.    Society as a whole ends up poorer.If I had a choice of living in a society where I was materiallymuch better off than I am now, but was among the poorest, or in onewhere I was the richest, but much worse off than I am now, I\\'d takethe first option.  If I had children, it would arguably be immoralnot to.  It\\'s absolute poverty you want to avoid, not relativepoverty.  If, as the evidence so far implies, you have to have oneor the other in your society, take relative poverty.You need rich people in your society not so much because in spendingtheir money they create jobs, but because of what they have to dotogetrich.  I\\'m not talking about the trickle-down effecthere.  I\\'m not saying that if you let Henry Ford get rich, he\\'llhire you as a waiter at his next party.  I\\'m saying that he\\'ll makeyou a tractor to replace your horse.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'At this year\\'s startup school, David Heinemeier Hansson gave atalkin which he suggested that startup foundersshould do things the old fashioned way.  Instead of hoping to getrich by building a valuable company and then selling stock in a\"liquidity event,\" founders should start companies that make moneyand live off the revenues.Sounds like a good plan.  Let\\'s think about the optimal way to dothis.One disadvantage of living off the revenues of your company is thatyou have to keep running it.  And as anyone who runs their ownbusiness can tell you, that requires your complete attention.  Youcan\\'t just start a business and check out once things are goingwell, or they stop going well surprisingly fast.The main economic motives of startup founders seem to be freedomand security.  They want enough money that (a) they don\\'t have toworry about running out of money and (b) they can spend their timehow they want.  Running your own business offers neither.  Youcertainly don\\'t have freedom: no boss is so demanding.  Nor do youhave security, because if you stop paying attention to the company,its revenues go away, and with them your income.The best case, for most people, would be if you could hire someoneto manage the company for you once you\\'d grown it to a certain size.Suppose you could find a really good manager.  Then you would haveboth freedom and security.  You could pay as little attention tothe business as you wanted, knowing that your manager would keepthings running smoothly.  And that being so, revenues would continueto flow in, so you\\'d have security as well.There will of course be some founders who wouldn\\'t like that idea:the ones who like running their company so much that there\\'s nothingelse they\\'d rather do.  But this group must be small.  The way yousucceed in most businesses is to be fanatically attentiveto customers\\' needs.  What are the odds that your own desires wouldcoincide exactly with the demands of this powerful, external force?Sure, running your own company can be fairly interesting.  Viawebwas more interesting than any job I\\'d had before.  And since I mademuch more money from it, it offered the highest ratio of income toboringness of anything I\\'d done, by orders of magnitude.  But wasitthemost interesting work I could imagine doing?  No.Whether the number of founders in the same position is asymptoticor merely large, there are certainly a lot of them.  For them theright approach would be to hand the company over to a professionalmanager eventually, if they could find one who was good enough._____So far so good.  But what if your manager was hit by a bus?  Whatyou really want is a management company to run your company foryou.  Then you don\\'t depend on any one person.If you own rental property, there are companies you can hire tomanage it for you.  Some will do everything, from finding tenantsto fixing leaks.  Of course, running companies is a lot morecomplicated than managing rental property, but let\\'s suppose therewere management companies that could do it for you. They\\'d chargea lot, but wouldn\\'t it be worth it?  I\\'d sacrifice a large percentageof the income for the extra peace of mind.I realize what I\\'m describing already sounds too good to be true, but Ican think of a way to make it even more attractive.  Ifcompany management companies existed, there would be an additionalservice they could offer clients: they could let them insure theirreturns by pooling their risk.  After all, even a perfect manager can\\'t save a companywhen, as sometimes happens, its whole market dies, just as propertymanagers can\\'t save you from the building burning down.  But acompany that managed a large enough number of companies could sayto all its clients: we\\'ll combine the revenues from all yourcompanies, and pay you your proportionate share.If such management companies existed, they\\'d offer the maximum offreedom and security.  Someone would run your company for you, andyou\\'d be protected even if it happened to die.Let\\'s think about how such a management company might be organized.The simplest way would be to have a new kind of stock representingthe total pool of companies they were managing.  When you signedup, you\\'d trade your company\\'s stock for shares of this pool, inproportion to an estimate of your company\\'s value that you\\'d bothagreed upon.  Then you\\'d automatically get your share of the returnsof the whole pool.The catch is that because this kind of trade would be hard to undo,you couldn\\'t switch management companies.  But there\\'s a way theycould fix that: suppose all the company management companies gottogether and agreed to allow their clients to exchange shares inall their pools.  Then you could, in effect, simultaneously chooseall the management companies to run yours for you, in whateverproportion you wanted, and change your mind later as often as youwanted.If such pooled-risk company management companies existed, signingup with one would seem the ideal plan for most people following theroute David advocated.Good news: they do exist.  What I\\'ve justdescribed is an acquisition by a public company._____Unfortunately, though public acquirers are structurally identicalto pooled-risk company management companies, they don\\'t think ofthemselves that way.  With a property management company, you canjust walk in whenever you want and say \"manage my rental propertyfor me\" and they\\'ll do it.  Whereas acquirers are, as of thiswriting, extremely fickle.  Sometimes they\\'re in a buying mood andthey\\'ll overpay enormously; other times they\\'re not interested.They\\'re like property management companies run by madmen.  Or moreprecisely, by Benjamin Graham\\'s Mr. Market.So while on average public acquirers behave like pooled-risk companymanagers, you need a window of several years to get average caseperformance.  If you wait long enough (five years, say) you\\'relikely to hit an up cycle where some acquirer is hot to buy you.But you can\\'t choose when it happens.You can\\'t assume investors will carry you for as long as you mighthave to wait. Your company has to make money.  Opinions are dividedabout how early to focus on that.Joe Kraussays you should trycharging customers right away.  And yet some of the most successfulstartups, including Google, ignored revenue at first and concentratedexclusively on development.  The answer probably depends on thetype of company you\\'re starting.  I can imagine some where tryingto make sales would be a good heuristic for product design, andothers where it would just be a distraction.  The test is probablywhether it helps you to understand your users.You can choose whichever revenue strategy you think is best for thetype of company you\\'re starting, so long as you\\'re profitable.Being profitable ensures you\\'ll get at least the average of theacquisition market—in which public companies do behave as pooled-riskcompany management companies.David isn\\'t mistaken in saying you should start a company to liveoff its revenues.  The mistake is thinking this is somehow opposedto starting a company and selling it.  In fact, for most people thelatter is merely the optimal case of the former.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'If Lisp is so great, why don\\'t more people use it?  I was    asked this question by a student in the audience at a talk I gave recently.  Not for the first time, either.In languages, as in so many things, there\\'s not much     correlation between popularity and quality.  Why does   John Grisham (King of Tortssales rank, 44) outsellJane Austen (Pride and Prejudicesales rank, 6191)?Would even Grisham claim that it\\'s because he\\'s a betterwriter?Here\\'s the first sentence ofPride and Prejudice:It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of awife.\"It is a truth universally acknowledged?\"  Long words forthe first sentence of a love story.Like Jane Austen, Lisp looks hard.  Its syntax, or lackof syntax, makes it look completelyunlikethe languagesmost people are used to.  Before I learned Lisp, I was afraidof it too.  I recently came across a notebook from 1983in which I\\'d written:I suppose I should learn Lisp, but it seems so foreign.Fortunately, I was 19 at the time and not too resistant to learningnew things.  I was so ignorant that learningalmost anything meant learning new things.People frightened by Lisp make up other reasons for notusing it.  The standardexcuse, back when C was the default language, was that Lispwas too slow.  Now that Lisp dialects are amongthefasterlanguages available, that excuse has gone away.Now the standard excuse is openly circular: that other languagesare more popular.(Beware of such reasoning.  It gets you Windows.)Popularity is always self-perpetuating, but it\\'s especiallyso in programming languages. More librariesget written for popular languages, which makes them stillmore popular.  Programs often have to work with existing programs,and this is easier if they\\'re written in the same language,so languages spread from program to program like a virus.And managers prefer popular languages, because they give them more leverage over developers, who can more easily be replaced.Indeed, if programming languages were all more or less equivalent,there would be little justification for using any but the mostpopular.  But theyaren\\'tall equivalent, not by a longshot.  And that\\'s why less popular languages, like Jane Austen\\'s novels, continue to survive at all.  When everyone else is reading the latest John Grisham novel, there will always be a few people reading Jane Austen instead.Japanese TranslationRomanian TranslationSpanish Translation'},\n",
       " {'title': 'The Four Quadrants of Conformism',\n",
       "  'date': 'July 2020',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'One of the most revealing ways to classify people is by the degreeand aggressiveness of their conformism. Imagine a Cartesian coordinatesystem whose horizontal axis runs from conventional-minded on theleft to independent-minded on the right, and whose vertical axisruns from passive at the bottom to aggressive at the top. Theresulting four quadrants define four types of people. Starting inthe upper left and going counter-clockwise: aggressivelyconventional-minded, passively conventional-minded, passivelyindependent-minded, and aggressively independent-minded.I think that you\\'ll find all four types in most societies, and thatwhich quadrant people fall into depends more on their own personalitythan the beliefs prevalent in their society.Young children offer some of the best evidence for both points.Anyone who\\'s been to primary school has seen the four types, andthe fact that school rules are so arbitrary is strong evidence thatwhich quadrant people fall into depends more on them than the rules.The kids in the upper left quadrant, the aggressively conventional-mindedones, are the tattletales. They believe not only that rules mustbe obeyed, but that those who disobey them must be punished.The kids in the lower left quadrant, the passively conventional-minded,are the sheep. They\\'re careful to obey the rules, but when otherkids break them, their impulse is to worry that those kids will bepunished, not to ensure that they will.The kids in the lower right quadrant, the passively independent-minded,are the dreamy ones. They don\\'t care much about rules and probablyaren\\'t 100% sure what the rules even are.And the kids in the upper right quadrant, the aggressivelyindependent-minded, are the naughty ones. When they see a rule,their first impulse is to question it. Merely being told what todo makes them inclined to do the opposite.When measuring conformism, of course, you have to say with respectto what, and this changes as kids get older. For younger kids it\\'sthe rules set by adults. But as kids get older, the source of rulesbecomes their peers. So a pack of teenagers who all flout schoolrules in the same way are not independent-minded; rather the opposite.In adulthood we can recognize the four types by their distinctivecalls, much as you could recognize four species of birds. The callof the aggressively conventional-minded is \"Crush <outgroup>!\" (It\\'srather alarming to see an exclamation point after a variable, butthat\\'s the whole problem with the aggressively conventional-minded.)The call of the passively conventional-minded is \"What will theneighbors think?\" The call of the passively independent-minded is\"To each his own.\" And the call of the aggressively independent-mindedis \"Eppur si muove.\"The four types are not equally common. There are more passive peoplethan aggressive ones, and far more conventional-minded people thanindependent-minded ones. So the passively conventional-minded arethe largest group, and the aggressively independent-minded thesmallest.Since one\\'s quadrant depends more on one\\'s personality than thenature of the rules, most people would occupy the same quadranteven if they\\'d grown up in a quite different society.Princeton professor Robert George recently wrote:I sometimes ask students what their position on slavery would   have been had they been white and living in the South before   abolition. Guess what? They all would have been abolitionists!   They all would have bravely spoken out against slavery, and   worked tirelessly against it.He\\'s too polite to say so, but of course they wouldn\\'t. And indeed,our default assumption should not merely be that his students would,on average, have behaved the same way people did at the time, butthat the ones who are aggressively conventional-minded today wouldhave been aggressively conventional-minded then too. In other words,that they\\'d not only not have fought against slavery, but thatthey\\'d have been among its staunchest defenders.I\\'m biased, I admit, but it seems to me that aggressivelyconventional-minded people are responsible for a disproportionateamount of the trouble in the world, and that a lot of the customswe\\'ve evolved since the Enlightenment have been designed to protectthe rest of us from them. In particular, the retirement of theconcept of heresy and its replacement by the principle of freelydebating all sorts of different ideas, even ones that are currentlyconsidered unacceptable, without any punishment for those who trythem out to see if they work.Why do the independent-minded need to be protected, though? Becausethey have all the new ideas. To be a successful scientist, forexample, it\\'s not enough just to be right. You have to be rightwhen everyone else is wrong. Conventional-minded people can\\'t dothat. For similar reasons, all successful startup CEOs are notmerely independent-minded, but aggressively so. So it\\'s no coincidencethat societies prosper only to the extent that they have customsfor keeping the conventional-minded at bay.In the last few years, many of us have noticed that the customsprotecting free inquiry have been weakened. Some say we\\'re overreacting— that they haven\\'t been weakened very much, or that they\\'ve beenweakened in the service of a greater good. The latter I\\'ll disposeof immediately. When the conventional-minded get the upper hand,they always say it\\'s in the service of a greater good.  It justhappens to be a different, incompatible greater good each time.As for the former worry, that the independent-minded are beingoversensitive, and that free inquiry hasn\\'t been shut down thatmuch, you can\\'t judge that unless you are yourself independent-minded.You can\\'t know how much of the space of ideas is being lopped offunless you have them, and only the independent-minded have the onesat the edges. Precisely because of this, they tend to be verysensitive to changes in how freely one can explore ideas. They\\'rethe canaries in this coalmine.The conventional-minded say, as they always do, that they don\\'twant to shut down the discussion of all ideas, just the bad ones.You\\'d think it would be obvious just from that sentence what adangerous game they\\'re playing. But I\\'ll spell it out. There aretwo reasons why we need to be able to discuss even \"bad\" ideas.The first is that any process for deciding which ideas to ban isbound to make mistakes. All the more so because no one intelligentwants to undertake that kind of work, so it ends up being done bythe stupid. And when a process makes a lot of mistakes, you needto leave a margin for error. Which in this case means you need toban fewer ideas than you\\'d like to. But that\\'s hard for theaggressively conventional-minded to do, partly because they enjoyseeing people punished, as they have since they were children, andpartly because they compete with one another. Enforcers of orthodoxycan\\'t allow a borderline idea to exist, because that gives otherenforcers an opportunity to one-up them in the moral purity department,and perhaps even to turn enforcer upon them. So instead of gettingthe margin for error we need, we get the opposite: a race to thebottom in which any idea that seems at all bannable ends up beingbanned.The second reason it\\'s dangerous to ban the discussion of ideas isthat ideas are more closely related than they look. Which means ifyou restrict the discussion of some topics, it doesn\\'t only affectthose topics. The restrictions propagate back into any topic thatyields implications in the forbidden ones. And that is not an edgecase. The best ideas do exactly that: they have consequencesin fields far removed from their origins. Having ideas in a worldwhere some ideas are banned is like playing soccer on a pitch thathas a minefield in one corner. You don\\'t just play the same gameyou would have, but on a different shaped pitch. You play a muchmore subdued game even on the ground that\\'s safe.In the past, the way the independent-minded protected themselveswas to congregate in a handful of places —  first in courts, andlater in universities — where they could to some extent make theirown rules. Places where people work with ideas tend to have customsprotecting free inquiry, for the same reason wafer fabs have powerfulair filters, or recording studios good sound insulation. For thelast couple centuries at least, when the aggressively conventional-mindedwere on the rampage for whatever reason, universities were thesafest places to be.That may not work this time though, due to the unfortunate factthat the latest wave of intolerance began in universities. It beganin the mid 1980s, and by 2000 seemed to have died down, but it hasrecently flared up again with the arrival of social media. Thisseems, unfortunately, to have been an own goal by Silicon Valley.Though the people who run Silicon Valley are almost all independent-minded,they\\'ve handed the aggressively conventional-minded a tool such asthey could only have dreamed of.On the other hand, perhaps the decline in the spirit of free inquirywithin universities is as much the symptom of the departure of theindependent-minded as the cause. People who would have becomeprofessors 50 years ago have other options now. Now they can becomequants or start startups. You have to be independent-minded tosucceed at either of those. If these people had been professors,they\\'d have put up a stiffer resistance on behalf of academicfreedom. So perhaps the picture of the independent-minded fleeingdeclining universities is too gloomy. Perhaps the universities aredeclining because so many have already left.Though I\\'ve spent a lot of time thinking about this situation, Ican\\'t predict how it plays out. Could some universities reverse thecurrent trend and remain places where the independent-minded wantto congregate? Or will the independent-minded gradually abandonthem? I worry a lot about what we might lose if that happened.But I\\'m hopeful long term. The independent-minded are good atprotecting themselves. If existing institutions are compromised,they\\'ll create new ones. That may require some imagination. Butimagination is, after all, their specialty.'},\n",

       "  'date': 'Want to start a startup?',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.April 2008Umair Haquewroterecently that the reason there aren\\'t more Googles isthat most startups get bought before they can change the world.Google, despite serious interest from Microsoft and Yahoo—what  must have seemed like lucrative interest at the time—didn\\'t  sell out. Google might simply have been nothing but Yahoo\\'s or  MSN\\'s search box.Why isn\\'t it? Because Google had a deeply felt sense of purpose:  a conviction to change the world for the better.This has a nice sound to it, but it isn\\'t true. Google\\'s founders were willing to sell early on.They just wanted more than acquirers were willing to pay.It was the same with Facebook.  They would have sold, but Yahoo blew it by offering too little.Tip for acquirers: when a startup turns you down, consider raisingyour offer, because there\\'s a good chance the outrageous price they want will later seem a bargain.From the evidence I\\'ve seen so far,startups that turn down acquisition offers usually end up doing better.  Not always, but usually there\\'s a bigger offer coming, orperhaps even an IPO.Of course, the reason startups do better when they turn downacquisition offers is not necessarily that all such offers undervaluestartups.  More likely the reason is that the kind of founders whohave the balls to turn down a big offer also tend to be verysuccessful.  That spirit is exactly what you want in a startup.While I\\'m sure Larry and Sergey do want to change the world, atleast now, the reason Google survived to become a big, independentcompany is the same reason Facebook has so far remained independent:acquirers underestimated them.Corporate M&A is a strange business in that respect.  They consistentlylose the best deals, because turning down reasonable offers is themost reliable test you could invent for whether a startup will makeit big.VCsSo what\\'s the real reason there aren\\'t more Googles?  Curiouslyenough, it\\'s the same reason Google and Facebook have remainedindependent: money guys undervalue the most innovative startups.The reason there aren\\'t more Googles is not that investors encourageinnovative startups to sell out, but that they won\\'t even fund them.I\\'ve learned a lot about VCs during the 3 years we\\'ve been doing YCombinator, because we often have to work quite closely with them.The most surprising thing I\\'ve learned is how conservative theyare.  VC firms present an image of boldly encouraging innovation.Only a handful actually do, and even they are more conservative inreality than you\\'d guess from reading their sites.I used to think of VCs as piratical: bold but unscrupulous.  Oncloser acquaintance they turn out to be more like bureaucrats.They\\'re more upstanding than I used to think (the good ones, atleast), but less bold.  Maybe the VC industry has changed.  Maybethey used to be bolder.  But I suspect it\\'s the startup world that haschanged, not them.  The low cost of starting a startup means theaverage good bet is a riskier one, but most existing VC firms stilloperate as if they were investing in hardware startups in 1985.Howard Aiken said \"Don\\'t worry about people stealing your ideas.If your ideas are any good, you\\'ll have to ram them down people\\'sthroats.\" I have a similar feeling when I\\'m trying to convince VCsto invest in startups Y Combinator has funded.  They\\'re terrifiedof really novel ideas, unless the founders are good enough salesmento compensate.But it\\'s the bold ideas that generate the biggest returns.  Anyreally good new idea will seem bad to most people; otherwise someonewould already be doing it.  Andyet most VCs are driven by consensus, not just within their firms,but within the VC community.  The biggest factor determining how aVC will feel about your startup is how other VCs feel about it.  Idoubt they realize it, but this algorithm guarantees they\\'ll missall the very best ideas.  The more people who have to like a newidea, the more outliers you lose.Whoever the next Google is, they\\'re probably being told right nowby VCs to come back when they have more \"traction.\"Why are VCs so conservative?  It\\'s probably a combination of factors.The large size of their investments makes them conservative.Plus they\\'re investing other people\\'s money, which makesthem worry they\\'ll get in trouble if they do something risky andit fails.  Plus most of them are money guys rather than technicalguys, so they don\\'t understand what the startups they\\'re investingin do.What\\'s NextThe exciting thing about market economies is that stupidity equalsopportunity.  And so it is in this case.  There is a huge, unexploitedopportunity in startup investing.  Y Combinator funds startups atthe very beginning.  VCs will fund them once they\\'re already startingto succeed.  But between the two there is a substantial gap.There are companies that will give $20k to a startup that has nothingmore than the founders, and there are companies that will give $2million to a startup that\\'s already taking off,but there aren\\'t enough investors who will give $200k to a startupthat seems very promising but still has some things to figure out.This territory is occupied mostly byindividual angel investors—people like Andy Bechtolsheim, whogave Google $100k when they seemed promising but still had somethings to figure out. I like angels, but there just aren\\'t enoughof them, and investing is for most of them a part time job.And yet as it gets cheaper to start startups, this sparsely occupiedterritory is becoming more and more valuable.   Nowadays a lot ofstartups don\\'t want to raise multi-million dollar series A rounds.They don\\'t need that much money, and they don\\'t want the hasslesthat come with it.  The median startup coming out of Y Combinatorwants to raise $250-500k.  When they go to VC firms they have toask for more because they know VCs aren\\'t interested in such smalldeals.VCs are money managers.  They\\'re looking for ways to put large sumsto work.  But the startup world is evolving away from their currentmodel.Startups have gotten cheaper.  That means they want less money, butalso that there are more of them.  So you can still get large returnson large amounts of money; you just have to spread it more broadly.I\\'ve tried to explain this to VC firms.  Instead of making one $2million investment, make five $400k investments.  Would that meansitting on too many boards?  Don\\'t sit on their boards.  Would thatmean too much due diligence?  Do less.  If you\\'re investing at atenth the valuation, you only have to be a tenth as sure.It seems obvious.  But I\\'ve proposed to several VC firms that theyset aside some money and designate one partner to make more, smallerbets, and they react as if I\\'d proposed the partners all get noserings.  It\\'s remarkable how wedded they are to their standard m.o.But there is a big opportunity here, and one way or the other it\\'sgoing to get filled.  Either VCs will evolve down into this gap or,more likely, new investors will appear to fill it.  That will be agood thing when it happens, because these new investors will becompelled by the structure of the investments they make to be tentimes bolder than present day VCs.  And that will get us a lot moreGoogles.  At least, as long as acquirers remain stupid.'},\n",

They assume ideas arelike miracles: they either pop into your head or they don\\'t.I also have a theory about why people think this.  They overvalueideas.  They think creating a startup is just a matter of implementingsome fabulous initial idea.  And since a successful startup is worthmillions of dollars, a good idea is therefore a million dollar idea.If coming up with an idea for a startup equals coming up with amillion dollar idea, then of course it\\'s going to seem hard.  Toohard to bother trying.  Our instincts tell us something so valuablewould not be just lying around for anyone to discover.Actually, startup ideas are not million dollar ideas, and here\\'san experiment you can try to prove it: just try to sell one.  Nothingevolves faster than markets.  The fact that there\\'s no market forstartup ideas suggests there\\'s no demand.  Which means, in thenarrow sense of the word, that startup ideas are worthless.QuestionsThe fact is, most startups end up nothing like the initial idea.It would be closer to the truth to say the main value of your initialidea is that, in the process of discovering it\\'s broken, you\\'llcome up with your real idea.The initial idea is just a starting point-- not a blueprint, but aquestion.  It might help if they were expressed that way.  Insteadof saying that your idea is to make a collaborative, web-basedspreadsheet, say: could one make a collaborative, web-basedspreadsheet?  A few grammatical tweaks, and a woefully incompleteidea becomes a promising question to explore.There\\'s a real difference, because an assertion provokes objectionsin a way a question doesn\\'t.  If you say: I\\'m going to build aweb-based spreadsheet, then critics-- the most dangerous of whichare in your own head-- will immediately reply that you\\'d be competingwith Microsoft, that you couldn\\'t give people the kind of UI theyexpect, that users wouldn\\'t want to have their data on your servers,and so on.A question doesn\\'t seem so challenging.  It becomes: let\\'s trymaking a web-based spreadsheet and see how far we get.  And everyoneknows that if you tried this you\\'d be able to makesomethinguseful.  Maybe what you\\'d end up with wouldn\\'t even be a spreadsheet.Maybe it would be some kind of new spreasheet-like collaborationtool that doesn\\'t even have a name yet.  You wouldn\\'t have thoughtof something like that except by implementing your way toward it.Treating a startup idea as a question changes what you\\'re lookingfor.  If an idea is a blueprint, it has to be right.  But if it\\'sa question, it can be wrong, so long as it\\'s wrong in a way thatleads to more ideas.One valuable way for an idea to be wrong is to be only a partialsolution.  When someone\\'s working on a problem that seems toobig, I always ask: is there some way to bite off some subset of theproblem, then gradually expand from there?  That will generallywork unless you get trapped on a local maximum, like 1980s-styleAI, or C.UpwindSo far, we\\'ve reduced the problem from thinking of a million dollaridea to thinking of a mistaken question.  That doesn\\'t seem so hard,does it?To generate such questions you need two things: to be familiar with promising new technologies, and to have the right kind of friends.New technologies are the ingredients startup ideas are made of, andconversations with friends are the kitchen they\\'re cooked in.Universities have both, and that\\'s why so many startups grow outof them.  They\\'re filled with new technologies, because they\\'retrying to produce research, and only things that are new count asresearch.  And they\\'re full of exactly the right kind of people to   have ideas with: the other students, who will be not only smart butelastic-minded to a fault.The opposite extreme would be a well-paying but boring job at a bigcompany.  Big companies are biased against new technologies, andthe people you\\'d meet there would be wrong too.In anessayI wrote for high school students,  I said a good rule of thumb was to stay upwind-- towork on things that maximize your future options. The principleapplies for adults too, though perhaps it has to be modified to:stay upwind for as long as you can, then cash in the potentialenergy you\\'ve accumulated when you need to pay for kids.I don\\'t think people consciously realize this, but one reasondownwind jobs like churning out Java for a bank pay so well is   precisely that they are downwind.  The market price for that kindof work is higher because it gives you fewer options for the future.A job that lets you work on exciting new stuff will tend to payless, because part of the compensation is in the form of the newskills you\\'ll learn.Grad school is the other end of the spectrum from a coding job ata big company: the pay\\'s low but you spend most of your time workingon new stuff.  And of course, it\\'s called \"school,\" which makesthat clear to everyone, though in fact all jobs are some percentageschool.The right environment for having startup ideas need not be auniversity per se.  It just has to be a situation with a largepercentage of school.It\\'s obvious why you want exposure to new technology, but why do you need other people?  Can\\'t you just think of new ideas yourself?The empirical answer is: no.  Even Einstein needed people to bounceideas off.  Ideas get developed in the process of explaining themto the right kind of person.  You need that resistance, justas a carver needs the resistance of the wood.This is one reason Y Combinator has a rule against investing in startups with only one founder.  Practically every successful companyhas at least two.  And because startup founders work under great   pressure, it\\'s critical they be friends.I didn\\'t realize it till I was writing this, but that may helpexplain why there are so few female startup founders.  I read onthe Internet (so it must be true) that only 1.7% of VC-backedstartups are founded by women.  The percentage of female hackersis small, but not that small.  So why the discrepancy?When you realize that successful startups tend to have multiplefounders who were already friends, apossible explanation emerges.  People\\'s best friends are likely to  be of the same sex, and if one group is a minority in some population,pairsof them will be a minority squared.DoodlingWhat these groups of co-founders do together is more complicated than just sitting down and trying to think of ideas.  I suspect the  most productive setup is a kind of together-alone-together sandwich.Together you talk about some hard problem, probably getting nowhere.Then, the next morning, one of you has an idea in the shower abouthow to solve it.  He runs eagerly to to tell the others, and togetherthey work out the kinks.What happens in that shower?  It seems to me that ideas just popinto my head.  But can we say more than that?Taking a shower is like a form of meditation.  You\\'re alert, butthere\\'s nothing to distract you.  It\\'s in a situation like this,where your mind is free to roam, that it bumps into new ideas.What happens when your mind wanders?  It may be like doodling.  Mostpeople have characteristic ways of doodling.  This habit is  unconscious, but not random: I found my doodles changed after I started studying painting.  I started to make the kind of gesturesI\\'d make if I were drawing from life.  They were atoms of drawing,  but arranged randomly.Perhaps letting your mind wander is like doodling with ideas.  Youhave certain mental gestures you\\'ve learned in your work, and whenyou\\'re not paying attention, you keep making these same gestures,   but somewhat randomly.  In effect, you call the same functions onrandom arguments.  That\\'s what a metaphor is: a function applied   to an argument of the wrong type.Conveniently, as I was writing this, my mind wandered: would it beuseful to have metaphors in a programming language?  I don\\'t know;I don\\'t have time to think about this.  But it\\'s convenient becausethis is an example of what I mean by habits of mind.  I spend a lotof time thinking about language design, and my habit of always   asking \"would x be useful in a programming language\" just gotinvoked.If new ideas arise like doodles, this would explain why you haveto work at something for a while before you have any.  It\\'s notjust that you can\\'t judge ideas till you\\'re an expert in a field.You won\\'t even generate ideas, because you won\\'t have any habitsof mind to invoke.Of course the habits of mind you invoke on some field don\\'t haveto be derived from working in that field.  In fact, it\\'s oftenbetter if they\\'re not.  You\\'re not just looking for good ideas, butfor goodnewideas, and you have a better chance of generatingthose if you combine stuff from distant fields.  As hackers, oneof our habits of mind is to ask, could one open-source x?  For  example, what if you made an open-source operating system?  A fineidea, but not very novel.  Whereas if you ask, could you make anopen-source play?  you might be onto something.Are some kinds of work better sources of habits of mind than others?I suspect harder fields may be better sources, because to attackhard problems you need powerful solvents.  I find math is a goodsource of metaphors-- good enough that it\\'s worth studying just forthat.  Related fields are also good sources, especially when they\\'rerelated in unexpected ways.  Everyone knows computer science andelectrical engineering are related, but precisely because everyoneknows it, importing ideas from one to the other doesn\\'t yield greatprofits.  It\\'s like importing something from Wisconsin to Michigan.  Whereas (I claim) hacking andpaintingarealso related, in the sense that hackers and painters are bothmakers,and this source of new ideas is practically virgin territory.ProblemsIn theory you could stick together ideas at random and see what youcame up with.  What if you built a peer-to-peer dating site?  Wouldit be useful to have an automatic book?  Could you turn theoremsinto a commodity?  When you assemble ideas at random like this, they may not be just stupid, but semantically ill-formed.  What would it even mean to make theorems a commodity?  You got me.  Ididn\\'t think of that idea, just its name.You might come up with something useful this way, but I never have.It\\'s like knowing a fabulous sculpture is hidden inside a block ofmarble, and all you have to do is remove the marble that isn\\'t partof it.  It\\'s an encouraging thought, because it reminds you there   is an answer, but it\\'s not much use in practice because the searchspace is too big.I find that to have good ideas I need to be working on some problem.You can\\'t start with randomness.  You have to start with a problem,then let your mind wander just far enough for new ideas to form.In a way, it\\'s harder to see problems than their solutions.  Most  people prefer to remain in denial about problems.  It\\'s obviouswhy: problems are irritating.  They\\'re problems!  Imagine if peoplein 1700 saw their lives the way we\\'d see them.  It would have beenunbearable.  This denial is such a powerful force that, even when presented with possible solutions, people often prefer to believethey wouldn\\'t work.I saw this phenomenon when I worked on spam filters.  In 2002, mostpeople preferred to ignore spam, and most of those who didn\\'tpreferred to believe the heuristic filters then available were thebest you could do.I found spam intolerable, and I felt it had to be possible torecognize it statistically.  And it turns out that was all you  needed to solve the problem.  The algorithm I used was ridiculouslysimple.  Anyone who\\'d really tried to solve the problem would havefound it.  It was just that no one had really tried to solve theproblem.Let me repeat that recipe: finding the problem intolerable and  feeling it must be possible to solve it.  Simple as it seems, that\\'sthe recipe for a lot of startup ideas.WealthSo far most of what I\\'ve said applies to ideas in general.  What\\'s  special about startup ideas?  Startup ideas are ideas for companies,and companies have to make money.  And the way to make money is tomake something people want.Wealth is what people want.  I don\\'t mean that as some kind of  philosophical statement; I mean it as a tautology.So an idea for a startup is an idea for something people want.Wouldn\\'t any good idea be something people want?  Unfortunately not.  I think new theorems are a fine thing to create, but thereis no great demand for them.  Whereas there appears to be greatdemand for celebrity gossip magazines.  Wealth is defined democratically.Good ideas and valuable ideas are not quite the same thing; thedifference is individual tastes.But valuable ideas are very close to good ideas, especially intechnology.  I think they\\'re so close that you can get away withworking as if the goal were to discover good ideas, so long as, inthe final stage, you stop and ask: will people actually pay for this?  Only a few ideas are likely to make it that far and then getshot down; RPN calculators might be one example.One way to make something people want is to look at stuff people   use now that\\'s broken.  Dating sites are a prime example.  They   have millions of users, so they must be promising something people want.  And yet they work horribly.  Just ask anyone who uses them.  It\\'s as if they used the worse-is-better approach but stopped afterthe first stage and handed the thing over to marketers.Of course, the most obvious breakage in the average computer user\\'s life is Windows itself.  But this is a special case: you can\\'tdefeat a monopoly by a frontal attack.  Windows can and will be     overthrown, but not by giving people a better desktop OS.  The wayto kill it is to redefine the problem as a superset of the current one.  The problem is not, what operating system should people useon desktop computers?  but how should people use applications?There are answers to that question that don\\'t even involve desktopcomputers.Everyone thinks Google is going to solve this problem, but it is avery subtle one, so subtle that a company as big as Google mightwell get it wrong.  I think the odds are better than 50-50 that theWindows killer-- or more accurately, Windows transcender-- willcome from some little startup.Another classic way to make something people want is to take aluxury and make it into a commmodity.  People must want somethingif they pay a lot for it.  And it is a very rare product that can\\'tbe made dramatically cheaper if you try.This was Henry Ford\\'s plan.  He made cars, which had been a luxuryitem, into a commodity.  But the idea is much older than Henry Ford.Water mills transformed mechanical power from a luxury into acommodity, and they were used in the Roman empire.  Arguablypastoralism transformed a luxury into a commodity.When you make something cheaper you can sell more of them.  But ifyou make something dramatically cheaper you often get qualitativechanges, because people start to use it in different ways.  Forexample, once computers get so cheap that most people can have oneof their own, you can use them as communication devices.Often to make something dramatically cheaper you have to redefine the problem.  The Model T didn\\'t have all the features previouscars did.  It only came in black, for example.  But it solved theproblem people cared most about, which was getting from place toplace.One of the most useful mental habits I know I learned from MichaelRabin: that the best way to solve a problem is often to redefineit.  A lot of people use this technique without being consciouslyaware of it, but Rabin was spectacularly explicit.  You need a bigprime number?  Those are pretty expensive.  How about if I give youa big number that only has a 10 to the minus 100 chance of not beingprime?  Would that do?  Well, probably; I mean, that\\'s probablysmaller than the chance that I\\'m imagining all this anyway.Redefining the problem is a particularly juicy heuristic when youhave competitors, because it\\'s so hard for rigid-minded people to follow.  You can work in plain sight and they don\\'t realize the danger.  Don\\'t worry about us. We\\'re just working on search.  Do   one thing and do it well, that\\'s our motto.Making things cheaper is actually a subset of a more generaltechnique: making things easier.  For a long time it was most of  making things easier, but now that the things we build are socomplicated, there\\'s another rapidly growing subset: making things  easier touse.This is an area where there\\'s great room for improvement.  What youwant to be able to say about technology is: it just works.  Howoften do you say that now?Simplicity takes effort-- genius, even.  The average programmer   seems to produce UI designs that are almost willfully bad. I was   trying to use the stove at my mother\\'s house a couple weeks ago. It was a new one, and instead of physical knobs it had buttons andan LED display.  I tried pressing some buttons I thought would causeit to get hot, and you know what it said?  \"Err.\"  Not even \"Error.\"\"Err.\"  You can\\'t just say \"Err\" to the user of astove.You should design the UI so that errors are impossible.  And the  boneheads who designed this stove even had an example of such a UIto work from: the old one.  You turn one knob to set the temperatureand another to set the timer.  What was wrong with that?  It justworked.It seems that, for the average engineer, more options just meansmore rope to hang yourself.  So if you want to start a startup, youcan take almost any existing technology produced by a big company, and assume you could build something way easier to use.Design for ExitSuccess for a startup approximately equals getting bought.  Youneed some kind of exit strategy, because you can\\'t get the smartestpeople to work for you without giving them options likely to beworth something.  Which means you either have to get bought or gopublic, and the number of startups that go public is very small.If success probably means getting bought, should you make that aconscious goal?  The old answer was no: you were supposed to pretendthat you wanted to create a giant, public company, and act surprisedwhen someone made you an offer.  Really, you want to buy us? Well,I suppose we\\'d consider it, for the right price.I think things are changing.  If 98% of the time success means   getting bought, why not be open about it?  If 98% of the time you\\'redoing product development on spec for some big company, why notthink of that as your task?  One advantage of this approach is thatit gives you another source of ideas: look at big companies, thinkwhat theyshouldbe doing, and do it yourself.  Even ifthey already know it, you\\'ll probably be done faster.Just be sure to make something multiple acquirers will want.  Don\\'tfix Windows, because the only potential acquirer is Microsoft, and  when there\\'s only one acquirer, they don\\'t have to hurry.  They cantake their time and copy you instead of buying you.  If you wantto get market price, work on something where there\\'s competition.If an increasing number of startups are created to do productdevelopment on spec, it will be a natural counterweight to monopolies.Once some type of technology is captured by a monopoly, it will    only evolve at big company rates instead of startup rates, whereasalternatives will evolve with especial speed.  A free marketinterprets monopoly as damage and routes around it.The Woz RouteThe most productive way to generate startup ideas is also themost unlikely-sounding: by accident.  If you look at how famousstartups got started, a lot of them weren\\'t initially supposed to  be startups.  Lotus began with a program Mitch Kapor wrote for afriend. Apple got started because Steve Wozniak wanted to buildmicrocomputers, and his employer, Hewlett-Packard, wouldn\\'t let himdo it at work.  Yahoo began as David Filo\\'s personal collection oflinks.This is not the only way to start startups.  You can sit down andconsciously come up with an idea for a company; we did.  But measuredin total market cap, the build-stuff-for-yourself model might be  more fruitful.  It certainly has to be the most fun way to come upwith startup ideas.  And since a startup ought to have multiplefounders who were already friends before they decided to start a company, the rather surprising conclusion is that the best way to   generate startup ideas is to do what hackers do for fun: cook upamusing hacks with your friends.It seems like it violates some kind of conservation law, but thereit is: the best way to get a \"million dollar idea\" is just to dowhat hackers enjoy doing anyway.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': '(This article was written as a kind of business plan for anew language.So it is missing (because it takes for granted) the most importantfeature of a good programming language: very powerful abstractions.)A friend of mine once told an eminent operating systemsexpert that he wanted to design a really goodprogramming language.  The expert told him that it would be awaste of time, that programming languages don\\'t become popularor unpopular based on their merits, and so no matter howgood his language was, no one would use it.  At least, thatwas what had happened to the languagehehad designed.What does make a language popular?  Do popularlanguages deserve their popularity?  Is it worth trying todefine a good programming language?  How would you do it?I think the answers to these questions can be found by looking at hackers, and learning what they want.  Programminglanguages areforhackers, and a programming languageis good as a programming language (rather than, say, anexercise in denotational semantics or compiler design)if and only if hackers like it.1 The Mechanics of PopularityIt\\'s true, certainly, that most people don\\'t choose programminglanguages simply based on their merits.  Most programmers are toldwhat language to use by someone else.  And yet I think the effectof such external factors on the popularity of programming languagesis not as great as it\\'s sometimes thought to be. I think a biggerproblem is that a hacker\\'s idea of a good programming language isnot the same as most language designers\\'.Between the two, the hacker\\'s opinion is the one that matters.Programming languages are not theorems. They\\'re tools, designedfor people, and they have to be designed to suit human strengthsand weaknesses as much as shoes have to be designed for human feet.If a shoe pinches when you put it on, it\\'s a bad shoe, howeverelegant it may be as a piece of sculpture.It may be that the majority of programmers can\\'t tell a good languagefrom a bad one. But that\\'s no different with any other tool. Itdoesn\\'t mean that it\\'s a waste of time to try designing a goodlanguage.Expert hackerscan tell a good language when they seeone, and they\\'ll use it. Expert hackers are a tiny minority,admittedly, but that tiny minority write all the good software,and their influence is such that the rest of the programmers willtend to use whatever language they use. Often, indeed, it is notmerely influence but command: often the expert hackers are the verypeople who, as their bosses or faculty advisors, tell the otherprogrammers what language to use.The opinion of expert hackers is not the only force that determinesthe relative popularity of programming languages — legacy software(Cobol) and hype (Ada, Java) also play a role — but I think it isthe most powerful force over the long term. Given an initial criticalmass and enough time, a programming language probably becomes aboutas popular as it deserves to be. And popularity further separatesgood languages from bad ones, because feedback from real live usersalways leads to improvements. Look at how much any popular languagehas changed during its life. Perl and Fortran are extreme cases,but even Lisp has changed a lot. Lisp 1.5 didn\\'t have macros, forexample; these evolved later, after hackers at MIT had spent acouple years using Lisp to write real programs. [1]So whether or not a language has to be good to be popular, I thinka language has to be popular to be good. And it has to stay popularto stay good. The state of the art in programming languages doesn\\'tstand still. And yet the Lisps we have today are still pretty muchwhat they had at MIT in the mid-1980s, because that\\'s the last timeLisp had a sufficiently large and demanding user base.Of course, hackers have to know about a language before they canuse it. How are they to hear? From other hackers. But there has tobe some initial group of hackers using the language for others evento hear about it. I wonder how large this group has to be; how manyusers make a critical mass? Off the top of my head, I\\'d say twenty.If a language had twenty separate users, meaning twenty users whodecided on their own to use it, I\\'d consider it to be real.Getting there can\\'t be easy. I would not be surprised if it isharder to get from zero to twenty than from twenty to a thousand.The best way to get those initial twenty users is probably to usea trojan horse: to give people an application they want, whichhappens to be written in the new language.2 External FactorsLet\\'s start by acknowledging one external factor that does affectthe popularity of a programming language. To become popular, aprogramming language has to be the scripting language of a popularsystem. Fortran and Cobol were the scripting languages of earlyIBM mainframes. C was the scripting language of Unix, and so, later,was Perl. Tcl is the scripting language of Tk. Java and Javascriptare intended to be the scripting languages of web browsers.Lisp is not a massively popular language because it is not thescripting language of a massively popular system. What popularityit retains dates back to the 1960s and 1970s, when it was thescripting language of MIT. A lot of the great programmers of theday were associated with MIT at some point. And in the early 1970s,before C, MIT\\'s dialect of Lisp, called MacLisp, was one of theonly programming languages a serious hacker would want to use.Today Lisp is the scripting language of two moderately popularsystems, Emacs and Autocad, and for that reason I suspect that mostof the Lisp programming done today is done in Emacs Lisp or AutoLisp.Programming languages don\\'t exist in isolation. To hack is atransitive verb — hackers are usually hacking something — and inpractice languages are judged relative to whatever they\\'re used tohack. So if you want to design a popular language, you either haveto supply more than a language, or you have to design your languageto replace the scripting language of some existing system.Common Lisp is unpopular partly because it\\'s an orphan. It didoriginally come with a system to hack: the Lisp Machine. But LispMachines (along with parallel computers) were steamrollered by theincreasing power of general purpose processors in the 1980s. CommonLisp might have remained popular if it had been a good scriptinglanguage for Unix. It is, alas, an atrociously bad one.One way to describe this situation is to say that a language isn\\'tjudged on its own merits. Another view is that a programming languagereally isn\\'t a programming language unless it\\'s also the scriptinglanguage of something. This only seems unfair if it comes as asurprise. I think it\\'s no more unfair than expecting a programminglanguage to have, say, an implementation. It\\'s just part of whata programming language is.A programming language does need a good implementation, of course,and this must be free. Companies will pay for software, but individualhackers won\\'t, and it\\'s the hackers you need to attract.A language also needs to have a book about it. The book should bethin, well-written, and full of good examples. K&R is the idealhere. At the moment I\\'d almost say that a language has to have abook published by O\\'Reilly. That\\'s becoming the test of matteringto hackers.There should be online documentation as well. In fact, the bookcan start as online documentation. But I don\\'t think that physicalbooks are outmoded yet. Their format is convenient, and the defacto censorship imposed by publishers is a useful if imperfectfilter. Bookstores are one of the most important places for learningabout new languages.3 BrevityGiven that you can supply the three things any language needs — afree implementation, a book, and something to hack — how do youmake a language that hackers will like?One thing hackers like is brevity. Hackers are lazy, in the sameway that mathematicians and modernist architects are lazy: theyhate anything extraneous. It would not be far from the truth tosay that a hacker about to write a program decides what languageto use, at least subconsciously, based on the total number ofcharacters he\\'ll have to type. If this isn\\'t precisely how hackersthink, a language designer would do well to act as if it were.It is a mistake to try to baby the user with long-winded expressionsthat are meant to resemble English. Cobol is notorious for thisflaw. A hacker would consider being asked to writeadd x to y giving zinstead ofz = x+yas something between an insult to his intelligence and a sin againstGod.It has sometimes been said that Lisp should use first and restinstead of car and cdr, because it would make programs easier toread. Maybe for the first couple hours. But a hacker can learnquickly enough that car means the first element of a list and cdrmeans the rest. Using first and rest means 50% more typing. Andthey are also different lengths, meaning that the arguments won\\'tline up when they\\'re called, as car and cdr often are, in successivelines. I\\'ve found that it matters a lot how code lines up on thepage. I can barely read Lisp code when it is set in a variable-widthfont, and friends say this is true for other languages too.Brevity is one place where strongly typed languages lose. All otherthings being equal, no one wants to begin a program with a bunchof declarations. Anything that can be implicit, should be.The individual tokens should be short as well. Perl and Common Lispoccupy opposite poles on this question. Perl programs can be almostcryptically dense, while the names of built-in Common Lisp operatorsare comically long. The designers of Common Lisp probably expectedusers to have text editors that would type these long names forthem. But the cost of a long name is not just the cost of typingit. There is also the cost of reading it, and the cost of the spaceit takes up on your screen.4 HackabilityThere is one thing more important than brevity to a hacker: beingable to do what you want. In the history of programming languagesa surprising amount of effort has gone into preventing programmersfrom doing things considered to be improper. This is a dangerouslypresumptuous plan. How can the language designer know what theprogrammer is going to need to do? I think language designers woulddo better to consider their target user to be a genius who willneed to do things they never anticipated, rather than a bumblerwho needs to be protected from himself. The bumbler will shoothimself in the foot anyway. You may save him from referring tovariables in another package, but you can\\'t save him from writinga badly designed program to solve the wrong problem, and takingforever to do it.Good programmers often want to do dangerous and unsavory things.By unsavory I mean things that go behind whatever semantic facadethe language is trying to present: getting hold of the internalrepresentation of some high-level abstraction, for example. Hackerslike to hack, and hacking means getting inside things and secondguessing the original designer.Let yourself be second guessed.When you make any tool, people useit in ways you didn\\'t intend, and this is especially true of ahighly articulated tool like a programming language. Many a hackerwill want to tweak your semantic model in a way that you neverimagined. I say, let them; give the programmer access to as muchinternal stuff as you can without endangering runtime systems likethe garbage collector.In Common Lisp I have often wanted to iterate through the fieldsof a struct — to comb out references to a deleted object, for example,or find fields that are uninitialized. I know the structs are justvectors underneath. And yet I can\\'t write a general purpose functionthat I can call on any struct. I can only access the fields byname, because that\\'s what a struct is supposed to mean.A hacker may only want to subvert the intended model of things onceor twice in a big program. But what a difference it makes to beable to. And it may be more than a question of just solving aproblem. There is a kind of pleasure here too. Hackers share thesurgeon\\'s secret pleasure in poking about in gross innards, theteenager\\'s secret pleasure in popping zits. [2] For boys, at least,certain kinds of horrors are fascinating. Maxim magazine publishesan annual volume of photographs, containing a mix of pin-ups andgrisly accidents. They know their audience.Historically, Lisp has been good at letting hackers have their way.The political correctness of Common Lisp is an aberration. EarlyLisps let you get your hands on everything. A good deal of thatspirit is, fortunately, preserved in macros. What a wonderful thing,to be able to make arbitrary transformations on the source code.Classic macros are a real hacker\\'s tool — simple, powerful, anddangerous. It\\'s so easy to understand what they do: you call afunction on the macro\\'s arguments, and whatever it returns getsinserted in place of the macro call. Hygienic macros embody theopposite principle. They try to protect you from understanding whatthey\\'re doing. I have never heard hygienic macros explained in onesentence. And they are a classic example of the dangers of decidingwhat programmers are allowed to want. Hygienic macros are intendedto protect me from variable capture, among other things, but variablecapture is exactly what I want in some macros.A really good language should be both clean and dirty: cleanlydesigned, with a small core of well understood and highly orthogonaloperators, but dirty in the sense that it lets hackers have theirway with it. C is like this. So were the early Lisps. A real hacker\\'slanguage will always have a slightly raffish character.A good programming language should have features that make the kindof people who use the phrase \"software engineering\" shake theirheads disapprovingly. At the other end of the continuum are languageslike Ada and Pascal, models of propriety that are good for teachingand not much else.5 Throwaway ProgramsTo be attractive to hackers, a language must be good for writingthe kinds of programs they want to write. And that means, perhapssurprisingly, that it has to be good for writing throwaway programs.A throwaway program is a program you write quickly for some limitedtask: a program to automate some system administration task, orgenerate test data for a simulation, or convert data from one formatto another. The surprising thing about throwaway programs is that,like the \"temporary\" buildings built at so many American universitiesduring World War II, they often don\\'t get thrown away. Many evolveinto real programs, with real features and real users.I have a hunch that the best big programs begin life this way,rather than being designed big from the start, like the Hoover Dam.It\\'s terrifying to build something big from scratch. When peopletake on a project that\\'s too big, they become overwhelmed. Theproject either gets bogged down, or the result is sterile andwooden: a shopping mall rather than a real downtown, Brasilia ratherthan Rome, Ada rather than C.Another way to get a big program is to start with a throwawayprogram and keep improving it. This approach is less daunting, andthe design of the program benefits from evolution. I think, if onelooked, that this would turn out to be the way most big programswere developed. And those that did evolve this way are probablystill written in whatever language they were first written in,because it\\'s rare for a program to be ported, except for politicalreasons. And so, paradoxically, if you want to make a language thatis used for big systems, you have to make it good for writingthrowaway programs, because that\\'s where big systems come from.Perl is a striking example of this idea. It was not only designedfor writing throwaway programs, but was pretty much a throwawayprogram itself. Perl began life as a collection of utilities forgenerating reports, and only evolved into a programming languageas the throwaway programs people wrote in it grew larger. It wasnot until Perl 5 (if then) that the language was suitable forwriting serious programs, and yet it was already massively popular.What makes a language good for throwaway programs? To start with,it must be readily available. A throwaway program is something thatyou expect to write in an hour. So the language probably mustalready be installed on the computer you\\'re using. It can\\'t besomething you have to install before you use it. It has to be there.C was there because it came with the operating system. Perl wasthere because it was originally a tool for system administrators,and yours had already installed it.Being available means more than being installed, though. Aninteractive language, with a command-line interface, is moreavailable than one that you have to compile and run separately. Apopular programming language should be interactive, and start upfast.Another thing you want in a throwaway program is brevity. Brevityis always attractive to hackers, and never more so than in a programthey expect to turn out in an hour.6 LibrariesOf course the ultimate in brevity is to have the program alreadywritten for you, and merely to call it. And this brings us to whatI think will be an increasingly important feature of programminglanguages: library functions. Perl wins because it has largelibraries for manipulating strings. This class of library functionsare especially important for throwaway programs, which are oftenoriginally written for converting or extracting data.  Many Perlprograms probably begin as just a couple library calls stucktogether.I think a lot of the advances that happen in programming languagesin the next fifty years will have to do with library functions. Ithink future programming languages will have libraries that are ascarefully designed as the core language. Programming language designwill not be about whether to make your language strongly or weaklytyped, or object oriented, or functional, or whatever, but abouthow to design great libraries. The kind of language designers wholike to think about how to design type systems may shudder at this.It\\'s almost like writing applications! Too bad. Languages are forprogrammers, and libraries are what programmers need.It\\'s hard to design good libraries. It\\'s not simply a matter ofwriting a lot of code. Once the libraries get too big, it cansometimes take longer to find the function you need than to writethe code yourself. Libraries need to be designed using a small setof orthogonal operators, just like the core language. It ought tobe possible for the programmer to guess what library call will dowhat he needs.Libraries are one place Common Lisp falls short. There are onlyrudimentary libraries for manipulating strings, and almost nonefor talking to the operating system. For historical reasons, CommonLisp tries to pretend that the OS doesn\\'t exist. And because youcan\\'t talk to the OS, you\\'re unlikely to be able to write a seriousprogram using only the built-in operators in Common Lisp. You haveto use some implementation-specific hacks as well, and in practicethese tend not to give you everything you want. Hackers would thinka lot more highly of Lisp if Common Lisp had powerful stringlibraries and good OS support.7 SyntaxCould a language with Lisp\\'s syntax, or more precisely, lack ofsyntax, ever become popular? I don\\'t know the answer to thisquestion. I do think that syntax is not the main reason Lisp isn\\'tcurrently popular. Common Lisp has worse problems than unfamiliarsyntax. I know several programmers who are comfortable with prefixsyntax and yet use Perl by default, because it has powerful stringlibraries and can talk to the os.There are two possible problems with prefix notation: that it isunfamiliar to programmers, and that it is not dense enough. Theconventional wisdom in the Lisp world is that the first problem isthe real one. I\\'m not so sure. Yes, prefix notation makes ordinaryprogrammers panic. But I don\\'t think ordinary programmers\\' opinionsmatter. Languages become popular or unpopular based on what experthackers think of them, and I think expert hackers might be able todeal with prefix notation. Perl syntax can be pretty incomprehensible,but that has not stood in the way of Perl\\'s popularity. If anythingit may have helped foster a Perl cult.A more serious problem is the diffuseness of prefix notation. Forexpert hackers, that really is a problem. No one wants to write(aref a x y) when they could write a[x,y].In this particular case there is a way to finesse our way out ofthe problem. If we treat data structures as if they were functionson indexes, we could write (a x y) instead, which is even shorterthan the Perl form. Similar tricks may shorten other types ofexpressions.We can get rid of (or make optional) a lot of parentheses by makingindentation significant. That\\'s how programmers read code anyway:when indentation says one thing and delimiters say another, we goby the indentation. Treating indentation as significant wouldeliminate this common source of bugs as well as making programsshorter.Sometimes infix syntax is easier to read. This is especially truefor math expressions. I\\'ve used Lisp my whole programming life andI still don\\'t find prefix math expressions natural. And yet it isconvenient, especially when you\\'re generating code, to have operatorsthat take any number of arguments. So if we do have infix syntax,it should probably be implemented as some kind of read-macro.I don\\'t think we should be religiously opposed to introducing syntaxinto Lisp, as long as it translates in a well-understood way intounderlying s-expressions. There is already a good deal of syntaxin Lisp. It\\'s not necessarily bad to introduce more, as long as noone is forced to use it. In Common Lisp, some delimiters are reservedfor the language, suggesting that at least some of the designersintended to have more syntax in the future.One of the most egregiously unlispy pieces of syntax in Common Lispoccurs in format strings; format is a language in its own right,and that language is not Lisp. If there were a plan for introducingmore syntax into Lisp, format specifiers might be able to be includedin it. It would be a good thing if macros could generate formatspecifiers the way they generate any other kind of code.An eminent Lisp hacker told me that his copy of CLTL falls open tothe section format. Mine too. This probably indicates room forimprovement. It may also mean that programs do a lot of I/O.8 EfficiencyA good language, as everyone knows, should generate fast code. Butin practice I don\\'t think fast code comes primarily from thingsyou do in the design of the language. As Knuth pointed out longago, speed only matters in certain critical bottlenecks.  And asmany programmers have observed since, one is very often mistakenabout where these bottlenecks are.So, in practice, the way to get fast code is to have a very goodprofiler, rather than by, say, making the language strongly typed.You don\\'t need to know the type of every argument in every call inthe program. You do need to be able to declare the types of argumentsin the bottlenecks. And even more, you need to be able to find outwhere the bottlenecks are.One complaint people have had with Lisp is that it\\'s hard to tellwhat\\'s expensive. This might be true. It might also be inevitable,if you want to have a very abstract language. And in any case Ithink good profiling would go a long way toward fixing the problem:you\\'d soon learn what was expensive.Part of the problem here is social. Language designers like towrite fast compilers. That\\'s how they measure their skill. Theythink of the profiler as an add-on, at best. But in practice a goodprofiler may do more to improve the speed of actual programs writtenin the language than a compiler that generates fast code. Here,again, language designers are somewhat out of touch with theirusers. They do a really good job of solving slightly the wrongproblem.It might be a good idea to have an active profiler — to pushperformance data to the programmer instead of waiting for him tocome asking for it. For example, the editor could display bottlenecksin red when the programmer edits the source code. Another approachwould be to somehow represent what\\'s happening in running programs.This would be an especially big win in server-based applications,where you have lots of running programs to look at. An activeprofiler could show graphically what\\'s happening in memory as aprogram\\'s running, or even make sounds that tell what\\'s happening.Sound is a good cue to problems. In one place I worked, we had abig board of dials showing what was happening to our web servers.The hands were moved by little servomotors that made a slight noisewhen they turned. I couldn\\'t see the board from my desk, but Ifound that I could tell immediately, by the sound, when there wasa problem with a server.It might even be possible to write a profiler that would automaticallydetect inefficient algorithms. I would not be surprised if certainpatterns of memory access turned out to be sure signs of badalgorithms. If there were a little guy running around inside thecomputer executing our programs, he would probably have as longand plaintive a tale to tell about his job as a federal governmentemployee. I often have a feeling that I\\'m sending the processor ona lot of wild goose chases, but I\\'ve never had a good way to lookat what it\\'s doing.A number of Lisps now compile into byte code, which is then executedby an interpreter. This is usually done to make the implementationeasier to port, but it could be a useful language feature. It mightbe a good idea to make the byte code an official part of thelanguage, and to allow programmers to use inline byte code inbottlenecks. Then such optimizations would be portable too.The nature of speed, as perceived by the end-user, may be changing.With the rise of server-based applications, more and more programsmay turn out to be i/o-bound. It will be worth making i/o fast.The language can help with straightforward measures like simple,fast, formatted output functions, and also with deep structuralchanges like caching and persistent objects.Users are interested in response time. But another kind of efficiencywill be increasingly important: the number of simultaneous usersyou can support per processor. Many of the interesting applicationswritten in the near future will be server-based, and the number ofusers per server is the critical question for anyone hosting suchapplications. In the capital cost of a business offering a server-basedapplication, this is the divisor.For years, efficiency hasn\\'t mattered much in most end-userapplications. Developers have been able to assume that each userwould have an increasingly powerful processor sitting on theirdesk. And by Parkinson\\'s Law, software has expanded to use theresources available. That will change with server-based applications.In that world, the hardware and software will be supplied together.For companies that offer server-based applications, it will makea very big difference to the bottom line how many users they cansupport per server.In some applications, the processor will be the limiting factor,and execution speed will be the most important thing to optimize.But often memory will be the limit; the number of simultaneoususers will be determined by the amount of memory you need for eachuser\\'s data. The language can help here too. Good support forthreads will enable all the users to share a single heap. It mayalso help to have persistent objects and/or language level supportfor lazy loading.9 TimeThe last ingredient a popular language needs is time. No one wantsto write programs in a language that might go away, as so manyprogramming languages do. So most hackers will tend to wait untila language has been around for a couple years before even consideringusing it.Inventors of wonderful new things are often surprised to discoverthis, but you need time to get any message through to people. Afriend of mine rarely does anything the first time someone askshim. He knows that people sometimes ask for things that they turnout not to want. To avoid wasting his time, he waits till the thirdor fourth time he\\'s asked to do something; by then, whoever\\'s askinghim may be fairly annoyed, but at least they probably really dowant whatever they\\'re asking for.Most people have learned to do a similar sort of filtering on newthings they hear about. They don\\'t even start paying attentionuntil they\\'ve heard about something ten times. They\\'re perfectlyjustified: the majority of hot new whatevers do turn out to be awaste of time, and eventually go away. By delaying learning VRML,I avoided having to learn it at all.So anyone who invents something new has to expect to keep repeatingtheir message for years before people will start to get it. Wewrote what was, as far as I know, the first web-server basedapplication, and it took us years to get it through to people thatit didn\\'t have to be downloaded. It wasn\\'t that they were stupid.They just had us tuned out.The good news is, simple repetition solves the problem. All youhave to do is keep telling your story, and eventually people willstart to hear. It\\'s not when people notice you\\'re there that theypay attention; it\\'s when they notice you\\'re still there.It\\'s just as well that it usually takes a while to gain momentum.Most technologies evolve a good deal even after they\\'re firstlaunched — programming languages especially. Nothing could be better,for a new techology, than a few years of being used only by a smallnumber of early adopters. Early adopters are sophisticated anddemanding, and quickly flush out whatever flaws remain in yourtechnology. When you only have a few users you can be in closecontact with all of them. And early adopters are forgiving whenyou improve your system, even if this causes some breakage.There are two ways new technology gets introduced: the organicgrowth method, and the big bang method. The organic growth methodis exemplified by the classic seat-of-the-pants underfunded garagestartup. A couple guys, working in obscurity, develop some newtechnology. They launch it with no marketing and initially haveonly a few (fanatically devoted) users. They continue to improvethe technology, and meanwhile their user base grows by word ofmouth. Before they know it, they\\'re big.The other approach, the big bang method, is exemplified by theVC-backed, heavily marketed startup. They rush to develop a product,launch it with great publicity, and immediately (they hope) havea large user base.Generally, the garage guys envy the big bang guys. The big bangguys are smooth and confident and respected by the VCs. They canafford the best of everything, and the PR campaign surrounding thelaunch has the side effect of making them celebrities. The organicgrowth guys, sitting in their garage, feel poor and unloved. Andyet I think they are often mistaken to feel sorry for themselves.Organic growth seems to yield better technology and richer foundersthan the big bang method. If you look at the dominant technologiestoday, you\\'ll find that most of them grew organically.This pattern doesn\\'t only apply to companies. You see it in sponsoredresearch too. Multics and Common Lisp were big-bang projects, andUnix and MacLisp were organic growth projects.10 Redesign\"The best writing is rewriting,\" wrote E. B. White.  Every goodwriter knows this, and it\\'s true for software too. The most importantpart of design is redesign. Programming languages, especially,don\\'t get redesigned enough.To write good software you must simultaneously keep two opposingideas in your head. You need the young hacker\\'s naive faith inhis abilities, and at the same time the veteran\\'s skepticism. Youhave to be able to thinkhow hard can it be?with one half ofyour brain while thinkingit will never workwith the other.The trick is to realize that there\\'s no real contradiction here.You want to be optimistic and skeptical about two different things.You have to be optimistic about the possibility of solving theproblem, but skeptical about the value of whatever solution you\\'vegot so far.People who do good work often think that whatever they\\'re workingon is no good. Others see what they\\'ve done and are full of wonder,but the creator is full of worry. This pattern is no coincidence:it is the worry that made the work good.If you can keep hope and worry balanced, they will drive a projectforward the same way your two legs drive a bicycle forward. In thefirst phase of the two-cycle innovation engine, you work furiouslyon some problem, inspired by your confidence that you\\'ll be ableto solve it. In the second phase, you look at what you\\'ve done inthe cold light of morning, and see all its flaws very clearly. Butas long as your critical spirit doesn\\'t outweigh your hope, you\\'llbe able to look at your admittedly incomplete system, and think,how hard can it be to get the rest of the way?, thereby continuingthe cycle.It\\'s tricky to keep the two forces balanced. In young hackers,optimism predominates. They produce something, are convinced it\\'sgreat, and never improve it. In old hackers, skepticism predominates,and they won\\'t even dare to take on ambitious projects.Anything you can do to keep the redesign cycle going is good. Prosecan be rewritten over and over until you\\'re happy with it. Butsoftware, as a rule, doesn\\'t get redesigned enough. Prose hasreaders, but software hasusers.If a writer rewrites an essay,people who read the old version are unlikely to complain that theirthoughts have been broken by some newly introduced incompatibility.Users are a double-edged sword. They can help you improve yourlanguage, but they can also deter you from improving it. So chooseyour users carefully, and be slow to grow their number. Havingusers is like optimization: the wise course is to delay it. Also,as a general rule, you can at any given time get away with changingmore than you think. Introducing change is like pulling off abandage: the pain is a memory almost as soon as you feel it.Everyone knows that it\\'s not a good idea to have a language designedby a committee. Committees yield bad design. But I think the worstdanger of committees is that they interfere with redesign. It isso much work to introduce changes that no one wants to bother.Whatever a committee decides tends to stay that way, even if mostof the members don\\'t like it.Even a committee of two gets in the way of redesign. This happensparticularly in the interfaces between pieces of software writtenby two different people. To change the interface both have to agreeto change it at once. And so interfaces tend not to change at all,which is a problem because they tend to be one of the most ad hocparts of any system.One solution here might be to design systems so that interfacesare horizontal instead of vertical — so that modules are alwaysvertically stacked strata of abstraction. Then the interface willtend to be owned by one of them. The lower of two levels will eitherbe a language in which the upper is written, in which case thelower level will own the interface, or it will be a slave, in whichcase the interface can be dictated by the upper level.11 LispWhat all this implies is that there is hope for a new Lisp.  Thereis hope for any language that gives hackers what they want, includingLisp. I think we may have made a mistake in thinking that hackersare turned off by Lisp\\'s strangeness. This comforting illusion mayhave prevented us from seeing the real problem with Lisp, or atleast Common Lisp, which is that it sucks for doing what hackerswant to do. A hacker\\'s language needs powerful libraries andsomething to hack. Common Lisp has neither. A hacker\\'s language isterse and hackable. Common Lisp is not.The good news is, it\\'s not Lisp that sucks, but Common Lisp. If wecan develop a new Lisp that is a real hacker\\'s language, I thinkhackers will use it. They will use whatever language does the job.All we have to do is make sure this new Lisp does some importantjob better than other languages.History offers some encouragement. Over time, successive newprogramming languages have taken more and more features from Lisp.There is no longer much left to copy before the language you\\'vemade is Lisp. The latest hot language, Python, is a watered-downLisp with infix syntax and no macros. A new Lisp would be a naturalstep in this progression.I sometimes think that it would be a good marketing trick to callit an improved version of Python. That sounds hipper than Lisp. Tomany people, Lisp is a slow AI language with a lot of parentheses.Fritz Kunze\\'s official biography carefully avoids mentioning theL-word.  But my guess is that we shouldn\\'t be afraid to call thenew Lisp Lisp. Lisp still has a lot of latent respect among thevery best hackers — the ones who took 6.001 and understood it, forexample. And those are the users you need to win.In \"How to Become a Hacker,\" Eric Raymond describes Lisp as somethinglike Latin or Greek — a language you should learn as an intellectualexercise, even though you won\\'t actually use it:Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience  you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make  you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you  never actually use Lisp itself a lot.If I didn\\'t know Lisp, reading this would set me asking questions.A language that would make me a better programmer, if it meansanything at all, means a language that would be better for programming.And that is in fact the implication of what Eric is saying.As long as that idea is still floating around, I think hackers willbe receptive enough to a new Lisp, even if it is called Lisp. Butthis Lisp must be a hacker\\'s language, like the classic Lisps ofthe 1970s. It must be terse, simple, and hackable. And it must havepowerful libraries for doing what hackers want to do now.In the matter of libraries I think there is room to beat languageslike Perl and Python at their own game. A lot of the new applicationsthat will need to be written in the coming years will beserver-basedapplications. There\\'s no reason a new Lisp shouldn\\'t have stringlibraries as good as Perl, and if this new Lisp also had powerfullibraries for server-based applications, it could be very popular.Real hackers won\\'t turn up their noses at a new tool that will letthem solve hard problems with a few library calls. Remember, hackersare lazy.It could be an even bigger win to have core language support forserver-based applications. For example, explicit support for programswith multiple users, or data ownership at the level of type tags.Server-based applications also give us the answer to the questionof what this new Lisp will be used to hack. It would not hurt tomake Lisp better as a scripting language for Unix. (It would behard to make it worse.) But I think there are areas where existinglanguages would be easier to beat. I think it might be better tofollow the model of Tcl, and supply the Lisp together with a completesystem for supporting server-based applications. Lisp is a naturalfit for server-based applications. Lexical closures provide a wayto get the effect of subroutines when the ui is just a series ofweb pages. S-expressions map nicely onto html, and macros are goodat generating it. There need to be better tools for writingserver-based applications, and there needs to be a new Lisp, andthe two would work very well together.12 The Dream LanguageBy way of summary, let\\'s try describing the hacker\\'s dream language.The dream language isbeautiful, clean, and terse. It has aninteractive toplevel that starts up fast. You can write programsto solve common problems with very little code.  Nearly all thecode in any program you write is code that\\'s specific to yourapplication. Everything else has been done for you.The syntax of the language is brief to a fault. You never have totype an unnecessary character, or even to use the shift key much.Using big abstractions you can write the first version of a programvery quickly. Later, when you want to optimize, there\\'s a reallygood profiler that tells you where to focus your attention. Youcan make inner loops blindingly fast, even writing inline byte codeif you need to.There are lots of good examples to learn from, and the language isintuitive enough that you can learn how to use it from examples ina couple minutes. You don\\'t need to look in the manual much. Themanual is thin, and has few warnings and qualifications.The language has a small core, and powerful, highly orthogonallibraries that are as carefully designed as the core language. Thelibraries all work well together; everything in the language fitstogether like the parts in a fine camera. Nothing is deprecated,or retained for compatibility. The source code of all the librariesis readily available. It\\'s easy to talk to the operating systemand to applications written in other languages.The language is built in layers. The higher-level abstractions arebuilt in a very transparent way out of lower-level abstractions,which you can get hold of if you want.Nothing is hidden from you that doesn\\'t absolutely have to be. Thelanguage offers abstractions only as a way of saving you work,rather than as a way of telling you what to do. In fact, the languageencourages you to be an equal participant in its design. You canchange everything about it, including even its syntax, and anythingyou write has, as much as possible, the same status as what comespredefined.'},\n",

In a rapidly growingmarket, you don't worry too much about efficiency.  It's moreimportant to grow fast.

This was an era whensmall firms making everything from cars to candy were gettingconsolidated into a new kind of corporation with national reach andhuge economies of scale.  You had to grow fast or die.

I decidedto find out by making it.Partly my goal was to create a guide that could be used by someoneworking in any field. But I was also curious about the shape of theintersection. And one thing this exercise shows is that it doeshave a definite shape; it\\'s not just a point labelled \"work hard.\"The following recipe assumes you\\'re very ambitious.The first step is to decide what to work on. The work you chooseneeds to have three qualities: it has to be something you have anatural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and thatoffers scope to do great work.In practice you don\\'t have to worry much about the third criterion.Ambitious people are if anything already too conservative about it.So all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude forand great interest in.That sounds straightforward, but it\\'s often quite difficult. Whenyou\\'re young you don\\'t know what you\\'re good at or what differentkinds of work are like. Some kinds of work you end up doing may noteven exist yet. So while some people know what they want to do at14, most have to figure it out.The way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you\\'re notsure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going.You\\'ll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that\\'s fine. It\\'sgood to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveriescome from noticing connections between different fields.Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don\\'t let \"work\"mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to dogreat work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own.It may be within some bigger project, but you\\'ll be driving yourpart of it.What should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitinglyambitious. As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves,exciting and important will converge. At 7 it may seem excitinglyambitious to build huge things out of Lego, then at 14 to teachyourself calculus, till at 21 you\\'re starting to explore unansweredquestions in physics. But always preserve excitingness.There\\'s a kind of excited curiosity that\\'s both the engine and therudder of great work.

Knowledge expands fractally, and from adistance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to getclose to one, they turn out to be full of gaps.The next step is to notice them. This takes some skill, becauseyour brain wants to ignore such gaps in order to make a simplermodel of the world. Many discoveries have come from asking questionsabout things that everyone else took for granted.If the answers seem strange, so much the better. Great work oftenhas a tincture of strangeness. You see this from painting to math.It would be affected to try to manufacture it, but if it appears,embrace it.Boldly chase outlier ideas, even if other people aren\\'t interestedin them — in fact, especially if they aren\\'t. If you\\'re excitedabout some possibility that everyone else ignores, and you haveenough expertise to say precisely what they\\'re all overlooking,that\\'s as good a bet as you\\'ll find.Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier,notice gaps, explore promising ones. This is how practically everyonewho\\'s done great work has done it, from painters to physicists.Steps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possibleto prove that you have to work hard to do great things, but theempirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality.That\\'s why it\\'s essential to work on something you\\'re deeplyinterested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than merediligence ever could.The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and thedesire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, andthat combination is the most powerful of all.The big prize is to discover a new fractal bud. You notice a crackin the surface of knowledge, pry it open, and there\\'s a whole worldinside.Let\\'s talk a little more about the complicated business of figuringout what to work on. The main reason it\\'s hard is that you can\\'ttell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. Whichmeans the four steps overlap: you may have to work at something foryears before you know how much you like it or how good you are atit. And in the meantime you\\'re not doing, and thus not learningabout, most other kinds of work. So in the worst case you chooselate based on very incomplete information.The nature of ambition exacerbates this problem. Ambition comes intwo forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one thatgrows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and themore you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide whatto do.The educational systems in most countries pretend it\\'s easy. Theyexpect you to commit to a field long before you could know whatit\\'s really like. And as a result an ambitious person on an optimaltrajectory will often read to the system as an instance of breakage.It would be better if they at least admitted it — if they admittedthat the system not only can\\'t do much to help you figure out whatto work on, but is designed on the assumption that you\\'ll somehowmagically guess as a teenager. They don\\'t tell you, but I will:when it comes to figuring out what to work on, you\\'re on your own.Some people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the rest willfind themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down onthe assumption that everyone does.What should you do if you\\'re young and ambitious but don\\'t knowwhat to work on? What you should not do is drift along passively,assuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take action.But there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you readbiographies of people who\\'ve done great work, it\\'s remarkable howmuch luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a resultof a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up.So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way todo that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people,read lots of books, ask lots of questions.When in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as youlearn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is verydifferent from what you do in high school math classes. So you needto give different types of work a chance to show you what they\\'relike. But a field should becomeincreasinglyinteresting as youlearn more about it. If it doesn\\'t, it\\'s probably not for you.Don\\'t worry if you find you\\'re interested in different things thanother people. The stranger your tastes in interestingness, thebetter. Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong tastefor work means you\\'ll be productive. And you\\'re more likely to findnew things if you\\'re looking where few have looked before.One sign that you\\'re suited for some kind of work is when you likeeven the parts that other people find tedious or frightening.But fields aren\\'t people; you don\\'t owe them any loyalty. If in thecourse of working on one thing you discover another that\\'s moreexciting, don\\'t be afraid to switch.If you\\'re making something for people, make sure it\\'s somethingthey actually want. The best way to do this is to make somethingyou yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build the toolyou want to use. Since your friends probably have similar interests,this will also get you your initial audience.Thisshouldfollow from the excitingness rule. Obviously the mostexciting story to write will be the one you want to read. The reasonI mention this case explicitly is that so many people get it wrong.Instead of making what they want, they try to make what someimaginary, more sophisticated audience wants. And once you go downthat route, you\\'re lost.There are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you\\'retrying to figure out what to work on. Pretentiousness, fashion,fear, money, politics, other people\\'s wishes, eminent frauds. Butif you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you\\'ll be proofagainst all of them. If you\\'re interested, you\\'re not astray.Following your interests may sound like a rather passive strategy,but in practice it usually means following them past all sorts ofobstacles. You usually have to risk rejection and failure. So itdoes take a good deal of boldness.But while you need boldness, you don\\'t usually need much planning.In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hardon excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come ofit. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just tryto preserve certain invariants.The trouble with planning is that it only works for achievementsyou can describe in advance. You can win a gold medal or get richby deciding to as a child and then tenaciously pursuing that goal,but you can\\'t discover natural selection that way.I think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategyis not to plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems mostinteresting and gives you the best options for the future. I callthis approach \"staying upwind.\" This is how most people who\\'ve donegreat work seem to have done it.Even when you\\'ve found something exciting to work on, working onit is not always straightforward. There will be times when some newidea makes you leap out of bed in the morning and get straight towork. But there will also be plenty of times when things aren\\'tlike that.You don\\'t just put out your sail and get blown forward by inspiration.There are headwinds and currents and hidden shoals. So there\\'s atechnique to working, just as there is to sailing.For example, while you must work hard, it\\'s possible to work toohard, and if you do that you\\'ll find you get diminishing returns:fatigue will make you stupid, and eventually even damage your health.The point at which work yields diminishing returns depends on thetype. Some of the hardest types you might only be able to do forfour or five hours a day.Ideally those hours will be contiguous. To the extent you can, tryto arrange your life so you have big blocks of time to work in.You\\'ll shy away from hard tasks if you know you might be interrupted.It will probably be harder to start working than to keep working.You\\'ll often have to trick yourself to get over that initialthreshold. Don\\'t worry about this; it\\'s the nature of work, not aflaw in your character. Work has a sort of activation energy, bothper day and per project. And since this threshold is fake in thesense that it\\'s higher than the energy required to keep going, it\\'sok to tell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get overit.It\\'s usually a mistake to lie to yourself if you want to do greatwork, but this is one of the rare cases where it isn\\'t. When I\\'mreluctant to start work in the morning, I often trick myself bysaying \"I\\'ll just read over what I\\'ve got so far.\" Five minuteslater I\\'ve found something that seems mistaken or incomplete, andI\\'m off.Similar techniques work for starting new projects. It\\'s ok to lieto yourself about how much work a project will entail, for example.Lots of great things began with someone saying \"How hard could itbe?\"This is one case where the young have an advantage. They\\'re moreoptimistic, and even though one of the sources of their optimismis ignorance, in this case ignorance can sometimes beat knowledge.Try to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to bemore work than you expected. Finishing things is not just an exercisein tidiness or self-discipline. In many projects a lot of the bestwork happens in what was meant to be the final stage.Another permissible lie is to exaggerate the importance of whatyou\\'re working on, at least in your own mind. If that helps youdiscover something new, it may turn out not to have been a lie afterall.Since there are two senses of starting work — per day and perproject — there are also two forms of procrastination. Per-projectprocrastination is far the more dangerous. You put off startingthat ambitious project from year to year because the time isn\\'tquite right. When you\\'re procrastinating in units of years, you canget a lot not done.One reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that itusually camouflages itself as work. You\\'re not just sitting arounddoing nothing; you\\'re working industriously on something else. Soper-project procrastination doesn\\'t set off the alarms that per-dayprocrastination does. You\\'re too busy to notice it.The way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am Iworking on what I most want to work on? When you\\'re young it\\'s okif the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerousas you get older.Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most peoplean unreasonable amount of time on a problem. You can\\'t think ofthis time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to find thework sufficiently engaging as it\\'s happening.There may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for yearsat things you hate before you get to the good part, but this is nothow great work happens. Great work happens by focusing consistentlyon something you\\'re genuinely interested in. When you pause to takestock, you\\'re surprised how far you\\'ve come.The reason we\\'re surprised is that we underestimate the cumulativeeffect of work. Writing a page a day doesn\\'t sound like much, butif you do it every day you\\'ll write a book a year. That\\'s the key:consistency. People who do great things don\\'t get a lot done everyday. They get something done, rather than nothing.If you do work that compounds, you\\'ll get exponential growth. Mostpeople who do this do it unconsciously, but it\\'s worth stopping tothink about. Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon:the more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more.Growing an audience is another: the more fans you have, the morenew fans they\\'ll bring you.The trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flatin the beginning. It isn\\'t; it\\'s still a wonderful exponentialcurve. But we can\\'t grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponentialgrowth in its early stages.Something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it\\'sworth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. But sincewe underrate exponential growth early on, this too is mostly doneunconsciously: people push through the initial, unrewarding phaseof learning something new because they know from experience thatlearning new things always takes an initial push, or they grow theiraudience one fan at a time because they have nothing better to do.If people consciously realized they could invest in exponentialgrowth, many more would do it.Work doesn\\'t just happen when you\\'re trying to. There\\'s a kind ofundirected thinking you do when walking or taking a shower or lyingin bed that can be very powerful. By letting your mind wander alittle, you\\'ll often solve problems you were unable to solve byfrontal attack.You have to be working hard in the normal way to benefit from thisphenomenon, though. You can\\'t just walk around daydreaming. Thedaydreaming has to be interleaved with deliberate work that feedsit questions.Everyone knows to avoid distractions at work, but it\\'s also importantto avoid them in the other half of the cycle. When you let yourmind wander, it wanders to whatever you care about most at thatmoment. So avoid the kind of distraction that pushes your work outof the top spot, or you\\'ll waste this valuable type of thinking onthe distraction instead. (Exception: Don\\'t avoid love.)Consciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field.Until you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don\\'tknow what you\\'re aiming for.And thatiswhat you\\'re aiming for, because if you don\\'t try tobe the best, you won\\'t even be good. This observation has been madeby so many people in so many different fields that it might be worththinking about why it\\'s true. It could be because ambition is aphenomenon where almost all the error is in one direction — wherealmost all the shells that miss the target miss by falling short.Or it could be because ambition to be the best is a qualitativelydifferent thing from ambition to be good. Or maybe being good issimply too vague a standard. Probably all three are true.Fortunately there\\'s a kind of economy of scale here. Though it mightseem like you\\'d be taking on a heavy burden by trying to be thebest, in practice you often end up net ahead. It\\'s exciting, andalso strangely liberating. It simplifies things. In some ways it\\'seasier to try to be the best than to try merely to be good.One way to aim high is to try to make something that people willcare about in a hundred years. Not because their opinions mattermore than your contemporaries\\', but because something that stillseems good in a hundred years is more likely to be genuinely good.Don\\'t try to work in a distinctive style. Just try to do the bestjob you can; you won\\'t be able to help doing it in a distinctiveway.Style is doing things in a distinctive way without trying to. Tryingto is affectation.Affectation is in effect to pretend that someone other than you isdoing the work. You adopt an impressive but fake persona, and whileyou\\'re pleased with the impressiveness, the fakeness is what showsin the work.The temptation to be someone else is greatest for the young. Theyoften feel like nobodies. But you never need to worry about thatproblem, because it\\'s self-solving if you work on sufficientlyambitious projects. If you succeed at an ambitious project, you\\'renot a nobody; you\\'re the person who did it. So just do the work andyour identity will take care of itself.\"Avoid affectation\" is a useful rule so far as it goes, but howwould you express this idea positively? How would you say what tobe, instead of what not to be? The best answer is earnest. If you\\'reearnest you avoid not just affectation but a whole set of similarvices.The core of being earnest is being intellectually honest. We\\'retaught as children to be honest as an unselfish virtue — as a kindof sacrifice. But in fact it\\'s a source of power too. To see newideas, you need an exceptionally sharp eye for the truth. You\\'retrying to see more truth than others have seen so far. And how canyou have a sharp eye for the truth if you\\'re intellectually dishonest?One way to avoid intellectual dishonesty is to maintain a slightpositive pressure in the opposite direction. Be aggressively willingto admit that you\\'re mistaken. Once you\\'ve admitted you were mistakenabout something, you\\'re free. Till then you have to carry it.Another more subtle component of earnestness is informality.Informality is much more important than its grammatically negativename implies. It\\'s not merely the absence of something. It meansfocusing on what matters instead of what doesn\\'t.What formality and affectation have in common is that as well asdoing the work, you\\'re trying to seem a certain way as you\\'re doingit. But any energy that goes into how you seem comes out of beinggood. That\\'s one reason nerds have an advantage in doing great work:they expend little effort on seeming anything. In fact that\\'sbasically the definition of a nerd.Nerds have a kind of innocent boldness that\\'s exactly what you needin doing great work. It\\'s not learned; it\\'s preserved from childhood.So hold onto it. Be the one who puts things out there rather thanthe one who sits back and offers sophisticated-sounding criticismsof them. \"It\\'s easy to criticize\" is true in the most literal sense,and the route to great work is never easy.There may be some jobs where it\\'s an advantage to be cynical andpessimistic, but if you want to do great work it\\'s an advantage tobe optimistic, even though that means you\\'ll risk looking like afool sometimes. There\\'s an old tradition of doing the opposite. TheOld Testament says it\\'s better to keep quiet lest you look like afool. But that\\'s advice forseemingsmart. If you actually wantto discover new things, it\\'s better to take the risk of tellingpeople your ideas.Some people are naturally earnest, and with others it takes aconscious effort. Either kind of earnestness will suffice. But Idoubt it would be possible to do great work without being earnest.It\\'s so hard to do even if you are. You don\\'t have enough marginfor error to accommodate the distortions introduced by being affected,intellectually dishonest, orthodox, fashionable, or cool.Great work is consistent not only with who did it, but with itself.It\\'s usually all of a piece. So if you face a decision in the middleof working on something, ask which choice is more consistent.You may have to throw things away and redo them. You won\\'t necessarilyhave to, but you have to be willing to. And that can take someeffort; when there\\'s something you need to redo, status quo biasand laziness will combine to keep you in denial about it. To beatthis ask: If I\\'d already made the change, would I want to revertto what I have now?Have the confidence to cut. Don\\'t keep something that doesn\\'t fitjust because you\\'re proud of it, or because it cost you a lot ofeffort.Indeed, in some kinds of work it\\'s good to strip whatever you\\'redoing to its essence. The result will be more concentrated; you\\'llunderstand it better; and you won\\'t be able to lie to yourself aboutwhether there\\'s anything real there.Mathematical elegance may sound like a mere metaphor, drawn fromthe arts. That\\'s what I thought when I first heard the term \"elegant\"applied to a proof. But now I suspect it\\'s conceptually prior — that the main ingredient in artistic elegance is mathematicalelegance. At any rate it\\'s a useful standard well beyond math.Elegance can be a long-term bet, though. Laborious solutions willoften have more prestige in the short term. They cost a lot ofeffort and they\\'re hard to understand, both of which impress people,at least temporarily.Whereas some of the very best work will seem like it took comparativelylittle effort, because it was in a sense already there. It didn\\'thave to be built, just seen. It\\'s a very good sign when it\\'s hardto say whether you\\'re creating something or discovering it.When you\\'re doing work that could be seen as either creation ordiscovery, err on the side of discovery. Try thinking of yourselfas a mere conduit through which the ideas take their natural shape.(Strangely enough, one exception is the problem of choosing a problemto work on. This is usually seen as search, but in the best caseit\\'s more like creating something. In the best case you create thefield in the process of exploring it.)Similarly, if you\\'re trying to build a powerful tool, make itgratuitously unrestrictive. A powerful tool almost by definitionwill be used in ways you didn\\'t expect, so err on the side ofeliminating restrictions, even if you don\\'t know what the benefitwill be.Great work will often be tool-like in the sense of being somethingothers build on. So it\\'s a good sign if you\\'re creating ideas thatothers could use, or exposing questions that others could answer.The best ideas have implications in many different areas.If you express your ideas in the most general form, they\\'ll be truerthan you intended.True by itself is not enough, of course. Great ideas have to betrue and new. And it takes a certain amount of ability to see newideas even once you\\'ve learned enough to get to one of the frontiersof knowledge.In English we give this ability names like originality, creativity,and imagination. And it seems reasonable to give it a separate name,because it does seem to some extent a separate skill. It\\'s possibleto have a great deal of ability in other respects — to have a greatdeal of what\\'s often called \"technical ability\" — and yet not havemuch of this.I\\'ve never liked the term \"creative process.\" It seems misleading.Originality isn\\'t a process, but a habit of mind. Original thinkersthrow off new ideas about whatever they focus on, like an anglegrinder throwing off sparks. They can\\'t help it.If the thing they\\'re focused on is something they don\\'t understandvery well, these new ideas might not be good. One of the mostoriginal thinkers I know decided to focus on dating after he gotdivorced. He knew roughly as much about dating as the average 15year old, and the results were spectacularly colorful. But to seeoriginality separated from expertise like that made its nature allthe more clear.I don\\'t know if it\\'s possible to cultivate originality, but thereare definitely ways to make the most of however much you have. Forexample, you\\'re much more likely to have original ideas when you\\'reworking on something. Original ideas don\\'t come from trying to haveoriginal ideas. They come from trying to build or understand somethingslightly too difficult.Talking or writing about the things you\\'re interested in is a goodway to generate new ideas. When you try to put ideas into words, amissing idea creates a sort of vacuum that draws it out of you.Indeed, there\\'s a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing.Changing your context can help. If you visit a new place, you\\'lloften find you have new ideas there. The journey itself oftendislodges them. But you may not have to go far to get this benefit.Sometimes it\\'s enough just to go for a walk.It also helps to travel in topic space. You\\'ll have more new ideasif you explore lots of different topics, partly because it givesthe angle grinder more surface area to work on, and partly becauseanalogies are an especially fruitful source of new ideas.Don\\'t divide your attentionevenlybetween many topics though,or you\\'ll spread yourself too thin. You want to distribute itaccording to something more like a power law.Be professionallycurious about a few topics and idly curious about many more.Curiosity and originality are closely related. Curiosity feedsoriginality by giving it new things to work on. But the relationshipis closer than that. Curiosity is itself a kind of originality;it\\'s roughly to questions what originality is to answers. And sincequestions at their best are a big component of answers, curiosityat its best is a creative force.Having new ideas is a strange game, because it usually consists ofseeing things that were right under your nose. Once you\\'ve seen anew idea, it tends to seem obvious. Why did no one think of thisbefore?When an idea seems simultaneously novel and obvious, it\\'s probablya good one.Seeing something obvious sounds easy. And yet empirically havingnew ideas is hard. What\\'s the source of this apparent contradiction?It\\'s that seeing the new idea usually requires you to change theway you look at the world. We see the world through models thatboth help and constrain us. When you fix a broken model, new ideasbecome obvious. But noticing and fixing a broken model is hard.That\\'s how new ideas can be both obvious and yet hard to discover:they\\'re easy to see after you do something hard.One way to discover broken models is to be stricter than otherpeople. Broken models of the world leave a trail of clues wherethey bash against reality. Most people don\\'t want to see theseclues. It would be an understatement to say that they\\'re attachedto their current model; it\\'s what they think in; so they\\'ll tendto ignore the trail of clues left by its breakage, however conspicuousit may seem in retrospect.To find new ideas you have to seize on signs of breakage insteadof looking away. That\\'s what Einstein did. He was able to see thewild implications of Maxwell\\'s equations not so much because he waslooking for new ideas as because he was stricter.The other thing you need is a willingness to break rules. Paradoxicalas it sounds, if you want to fix your model of the world, it helpsto be the sort of person who\\'s comfortable breaking rules. From thepoint of view of the old model, which everyone including you initiallyshares, the new model usually breaks at least implicit rules.Few understand the degree of rule-breaking required, because newideas seem much more conservative once they succeed. They seemperfectly reasonable once you\\'re using the new model of the worldthey brought with them. But they didn\\'t at the time; it took thegreater part of a century for the heliocentric model to be generallyaccepted, even among astronomers, because it felt so wrong.Indeed, if you think about it, a good new idea has to seem bad tomost people, or someone would have already explored it. So whatyou\\'re looking for is ideas that seem crazy, but the right kind ofcrazy. How do you recognize these? You can\\'t with certainty. Oftenideas that seem bad are bad. But ideas that are the right kind ofcrazy tend to be exciting; they\\'re rich in implications; whereasideas that are merely bad tend to be depressing.There are two ways to be comfortable breaking rules: to enjoybreaking them, and to be indifferent to them. I call these two casesbeing aggressively and passively independent-minded.The aggressively independent-minded are the naughty ones. Rulesdon\\'t merely fail to stop them; breaking rules gives them additionalenergy. For this sort of person, delight at the sheer audacity ofa project sometimes supplies enough activation energy to get itstarted.The other way to break rules is not to care about them, or perhapseven to know they exist. This is why novices and outsiders oftenmake new discoveries; their ignorance of a field\\'s assumptions actsas a source of temporary passive independent-mindedness. Aspiesalso seem to have a kind of immunity to conventional beliefs.Several I know say that this helps them to have new ideas.Strictness plus rule-breaking sounds like a strange combination.In popular culture they\\'re opposed. But popular culture has a brokenmodel in this respect. It implicitly assumes that issues are trivialones, and in trivial matters strictness and rule-breakingareopposed. But in questions that really matter, only rule-breakerscan be truly strict.An overlooked idea often doesn\\'t lose till the semifinals. You dosee it, subconsciously, but then another part of your subconsciousshoots it down because it would be too weird, too risky, too muchwork, too controversial. This suggests an exciting possibility: ifyou could turn off such filters, you could see more new ideas.One way to do that is to ask what would be good ideas forsomeoneelseto explore. Then your subconscious won\\'t shoot them down toprotect you.You could also discover overlooked ideas by working in the otherdirection: by starting from what\\'s obscuring them. Every cherishedbut mistaken principle is surrounded by a dead zone of valuableideas that are unexplored because they contradict it.Religions are collections of cherished but mistaken principles. Soanything that can be described either literally or metaphoricallyas a religion will have valuable unexplored ideas in its shadow.Copernicus and Darwin both made discoveries of this type.What are people in your field religious about, in the sense of beingtoo attached to some principle that might not be as self-evidentas they think? What becomes possible if you discard it?People show much more originality in solving problems than indeciding which problems to solve. Even the smartest can be surprisinglyconservative when deciding what to work on. People who\\'d never dreamof being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working onfashionable problems.One reason people are more conservative when choosing problems thansolutions is that problems are bigger bets. A problem could occupyyou for years, while exploring a solution might only take days. Buteven so I think most people are too conservative. They\\'re not merelyresponding to risk, but to fashion as well. Unfashionable problemsare undervalued.One of the most interesting kinds of unfashionable problem is theproblem that people think has been fully explored, but hasn\\'t.Great work often takes something that already exists and shows itslatent potential. Durer and Watt both did this. So if you\\'reinterested in a field that others think is tapped out, don\\'t lettheir skepticism deter you. People are often wrong about this.Working on an unfashionable problem can be very pleasing. There\\'sno hype or hurry. Opportunists and critics are both occupiedelsewhere. The existing work often has an old-school solidity. Andthere\\'s a satisfying sense of economy in cultivating ideas thatwould otherwise be wasted.But the most common type of overlooked problem is not explicitlyunfashionable in the sense of being out of fashion. It just doesn\\'tseem to matter as much as it actually does. How do you find these?By being self-indulgent — by letting your curiosity have its way,and tuning out, at least temporarily, the little voice in your headthat says you should only be working on \"important\" problems.You do need to work on important problems, but almost everyone istoo conservative about what counts as one. And if there\\'s an importantbut overlooked problem in your neighborhood, it\\'s probably alreadyon your subconscious radar screen. So try asking yourself: if youwere going to take a break from \"serious\" work to work on somethingjust because it would be really interesting, what would you do? Theanswer is probably more important than it seems.Originality in choosing problems seems to matter even more thanoriginality in solving them. That\\'s what distinguishes the peoplewho discover whole new fields. So what might seem to be merely theinitial step — deciding what to work on — is in a sense the keyto the whole game.Few grasp this. One of the biggest misconceptions about new ideasis about the ratio of question to answer in their composition.People think big ideas are answers, but often the real insight wasin the question.Part of the reason we underrate questions is the way they\\'re usedin schools. In schools they tend to exist only briefly before beinganswered, like unstable particles. But a really good question canbe much more than that. A really good question is a partial discovery.How do new species arise? Is the force that makes objects fall toearth the same as the one that keeps planets in their orbits? Byeven asking such questions you were already in excitingly novelterritory.Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable things to carry aroundwith you. But the more you\\'re carrying, the greater the chance ofnoticing a solution — or perhaps even more excitingly, noticingthat two unanswered questions are the same.Sometimes you carry a question for a long time. Great work oftencomes from returning to a question you first noticed years before— in your childhood, even — and couldn\\'t stop thinking about.People talk a lot about the importance of keeping your youthfuldreams alive, but it\\'s just as important to keep your youthfulquestions alive.This is one of the places where actual expertise differs most fromthe popular picture of it. In the popular picture, experts arecertain. But actually the more puzzled you are, the better, so longas (a) the things you\\'re puzzled about matter, and (b) no one elseunderstands them either.Think about what\\'s happening at the moment just before a new ideais discovered. Often someone with sufficient expertise is puzzledabout something. Which means that originality consists partly ofpuzzlement — of confusion! You have to be comfortable enough withthe world being full of puzzles that you\\'re willing to see them,but not so comfortable that you don\\'t want to solve them.It\\'s a great thing to be rich in unanswered questions. And this isone of those situations where the rich get richer, because the bestway to acquire new questions is to try answering existing ones.Questions don\\'t just lead to answers, but also to more questions.The best questions grow in the answering. You notice a threadprotruding from the current paradigm and try pulling on it, and itjust gets longer and longer. So don\\'t require a question to beobviously big before you try answering it. You can rarely predictthat. It\\'s hard enough even to notice the thread, let alone topredict how much will unravel if you pull on it.It\\'s better to be promiscuously curious — to pull a little bit ona lot of threads, and see what happens. Big things start small. Theinitial versions of big things were often just experiments, or sideprojects, or talks, which then grew into something bigger. So startlots of small things.Being prolific is underrated. The more different things you try,the greater the chance of discovering something new. Understand,though, that trying lots of things will mean trying lots of thingsthat don\\'t work. You can\\'t have a lot of good ideas without alsohaving a lot of bad ones.Though it sounds more responsible to begin by studying everythingthat\\'s been done before, you\\'ll learn faster and have more fun bytrying stuff. And you\\'ll understand previous work better when youdo look at it. So err on the side of starting. Which is easier whenstarting means starting small; those two ideas fit together liketwo puzzle pieces.How do you get from starting small to doing something great? Bymaking successive versions. Great things are almost always made insuccessive versions. You start with something small and evolve it,and the final version is both cleverer and more ambitious thananything you could have planned.It\\'s particularly useful to make successive versions when you\\'remaking something for people — to get an initial version in frontof them quickly, and then evolve it based on their response.Begin by trying the simplest thing that could possibly work.Surprisingly often, it does. If it doesn\\'t, this will at least getyou started.Don\\'t try to cram too much new stuff into any one version. Thereare names for doing this with the first version (taking too longto ship) and the second (the second system effect), but these areboth merely instances of a more general principle.An early version of a new project will sometimes be dismissed as atoy. It\\'s a good sign when people do this. That means it haseverything a new idea needs except scale, and that tends to follow.The alternative to starting with something small and evolving itis to plan in advance what you\\'re going to do. And planning doesusually seem the more responsible choice. It sounds more organizedto say \"we\\'re going to do x and then y and then z\" than \"we\\'re goingto try x and see what happens.\" And it is moreorganized; it justdoesn\\'t work as well.Planning per se isn\\'t good. It\\'s sometimes necessary, but it\\'s anecessary evil — a response to unforgiving conditions. It\\'s somethingyou have to do because you\\'re working with inflexible media, orbecause you need to coordinate the efforts of a lot of people. Ifyou keep projects small and use flexible media, you don\\'t have toplan as much, and your designs can evolve instead.Take as much risk as you can afford. In an efficient market, riskis proportionate to reward, so don\\'t look for certainty, but for abet with high expected value. If you\\'re not failing occasionally,you\\'re probably being too conservative.Though conservatism is usually associated with the old, it\\'s theyoung who tend to make this mistake. Inexperience makes them fearrisk, but it\\'s when you\\'re young that you can afford the most.Even a project that fails can be valuable. In the process of workingon it, you\\'ll have crossed territory few others have seen, andencountered questions few others have asked. And there\\'s probablyno better source of questions than the ones you encounter in tryingto do something slightly too hard.Use the advantages of youth when you have them, and the advantagesof age once you have those. The advantages of youth are energy,time, optimism, and freedom. The advantages of age are knowledge,efficiency, money, and power. With effort you can acquire some ofthe latter when young and keep some of the former when old.The old also have the advantage of knowing which advantages theyhave. The young often have them without realizing it. The biggestis probably time. The young have no idea how rich they are in time.The best way to turn this time to advantage is to use it in slightlyfrivolous ways: to learn about something you don\\'t need to knowabout, just out of curiosity, or to try building something justbecause it would be cool, or to become freakishly good at something.That \"slightly\" is an important qualification. Spend time lavishlywhen you\\'re young, but don\\'t simply waste it. There\\'s a big differencebetween doing something you worry might be a waste of time and doingsomething you know for sure will be. The former is at least a bet,and possibly a better one than you think.The most subtle advantage of youth, or more precisely of inexperience,is that you\\'re seeing everything with fresh eyes. When your brainembraces an idea for the first time, sometimes the two don\\'t fittogether perfectly. Usually the problem is with your brain, butoccasionally it\\'s with the idea. A piece of it sticks out awkwardlyand jabs you when you think about it. People who are used to theidea have learned to ignore it, but you have the opportunity notto.So when you\\'re learning about something for the first time, payattention to things that seem wrong or missing. You\\'ll be temptedto ignore them, since there\\'s a 99% chance the problem is with you.And you may have to set aside your misgivings temporarily to keepprogressing. But don\\'t forget about them. When you\\'ve gotten furtherinto the subject, come back and check if they\\'re still there. Ifthey\\'re still viable in the light of your present knowledge, theyprobably represent an undiscovered idea.One of the most valuable kinds of knowledge you get from experienceis to know what youdon\\'thave to worry about. The young know allthe things that could matter, but not their relative importance.So they worry equally about everything, when they should worry muchmore about a few things and hardly at all about the rest.But what you don\\'t know is only half the problem with inexperience.The other half is what you do know that ain\\'t so. You arrive atadulthood with your head full of nonsense — bad habits you\\'veacquired and false things you\\'ve been taught — and you won\\'t beable to do great work till you clear away at least the nonsense inthe way of whatever type of work you want to do.Much of the nonsense left in your head is left there by schools.We\\'re so used to schools that we unconsciously treat going to schoolas identical with learning, but in fact schools have all sorts ofstrange qualities that warp our ideas about learning and thinking.For example, schools induce passivity. Since you were a small child,there was an authority at the front of the class telling all of youwhat you had to learn and then measuring whether you did. But neitherclasses nor tests are intrinsic to learning; they\\'re just artifactsof the way schools are usually designed.The sooner you overcome this passivity, the better. If you\\'re stillin school, try thinking of your education as your project, and yourteachers as working for you rather than vice versa. That may seema stretch, but it\\'s not merely some weird thought experiment. It\\'sthe truth, economically, and in the best case it\\'s the truthintellectually as well. The best teachers don\\'t want to be yourbosses. They\\'d prefer it if you pushed ahead, using them as a sourceof advice, rather than being pulled by them through the material.Schools also give you a misleading impression of what work is like.In school they tell you what the problems are, and they\\'re almostalways soluble using no more than you\\'ve been taught so far. Inreal life you have to figure out what the problems are, and youoften don\\'t know if they\\'re soluble at all.But perhaps the worst thing schools do to you is train you to winby hacking the test. You can\\'t do great work by doing that. Youcan\\'t trick God. So stop looking for that kind of shortcut. The wayto beat the system is to focus on problems and solutions that othershave overlooked, not to skimp on the work itself.Don\\'t think of yourself as dependent on some gatekeeper giving youa \"big break.\" Even if this were true, the best way to get it wouldbe to focus on doing good work rather than chasing influentialpeople.And don\\'t take rejection by committees to heart. The qualities thatimpress admissions officers and prize committees are quite differentfrom those required to do great work. The decisions of selectioncommittees are only meaningful to the extent that they\\'re part ofa feedback loop, and very few are.People new to a field will often copy existing work. There\\'s nothinginherently bad about that. There\\'s no better way to learn howsomething works than by trying to reproduce it. Nor doescopying necessarily make your work unoriginal. Originality is thepresence of new ideas, not the absence of old ones.There\\'s a good way to copy and a bad way. If you\\'re going to copysomething, do it openly instead of furtively, or worse still,unconsciously. This is what\\'s meant by the famously misattributedphrase \"Great artists steal.\" The really dangerous kind of copying,the kind that gives copying a bad name, is the kind that\\'s donewithout realizing it, because you\\'re nothing more than a trainrunning on tracks laid down by someone else. But at the otherextreme, copying can be a sign of superiority rather than subordination.In many fields it\\'s almost inevitable that your early work will bein some sense based on other people\\'s. Projects rarely arise in avacuum. They\\'re usually a reaction to previous work. When you\\'refirst starting out, you don\\'t have any previous work; if you\\'regoing to react to something, it has to be someone else\\'s. Onceyou\\'re established, you can react to your own. But while the formergets called derivative and the latter doesn\\'t, structurally the twocases are more similar than they seem.Oddly enough, the very novelty of the most novel ideas sometimesmakes them seem at first to be more derivative than they are. Newdiscoveries often have to be conceived initially as variations ofexisting things,even by their discoverers, because there isn\\'tyet the conceptual vocabulary to express them.There are definitely some dangers to copying, though. One is thatyou\\'ll tend to copy old things — things that were in their day atthe frontier of knowledge, but no longer are.And when you do copy something, don\\'t copy every feature of it.Some will make you ridiculous if you do. Don\\'t copy the manner ofan eminent 50 year old professor if you\\'re 18, for example, or theidiom of a Renaissance poem hundreds of years later.Some of the features of things you admire are flaws they succeededdespite. Indeed, the features that are easiest to imitate are themost likely to be the flaws.This is particularly true for behavior. Some talented people arejerks, and this sometimes makes it seem to the inexperienced thatbeing a jerk is part of being talented. It isn\\'t; being talentedis merely how they get away with it.One of the most powerful kinds of copying is to copy something fromone field into another. History is so full of chance discoveriesof this type that it\\'s probably worth giving chance a hand bydeliberately learning about other kinds of work. You can take ideasfrom quite distant fields if you let them be metaphors.Negative examples can be as inspiring as positive ones. In fact youcan sometimes learn more from things done badly than from thingsdone well; sometimes it only becomes clear what\\'s needed when it\\'smissing.If a lot of the best people in your field are collected in oneplace, it\\'s usually a good idea to visit for a while. It willincrease your ambition, and also, by showing you that these peopleare human, increase your self-confidence.If you\\'re earnest you\\'ll probably get a warmer welcome than youmight expect. Most people who are very good at something are happyto talk about it with anyone who\\'s genuinely interested. If they\\'rereally good at their work, then they probably have a hobbyist\\'sinterest in it, and hobbyists always want to talk about theirhobbies.It may take some effort to find the people who are really good,though. Doing great work has such prestige that in some places,particularly universities, there\\'s a polite fiction that everyoneis engaged in it. And that is far from true. People within universitiescan\\'t say so openly, but the quality of the work being done indifferent departments varies immensely. Some departments have peopledoing great work; others have in the past; others never have.Seek out the best colleagues. There are a lot of projects that can\\'tbe done alone, and even if you\\'re working on one that can be, it\\'sgood to have other people to encourage you and to bounce ideas off.Colleagues don\\'t just affect your work, though; they also affectyou. So work with people you want to become like, because you will.Quality is more important than quantity in colleagues. It\\'s betterto have one or two great ones than a building full of pretty goodones. In fact it\\'s not merely better, but necessary, judging fromhistory: the degree to which great work happens in clusters suggeststhat one\\'s colleagues often make the difference between doing greatwork and not.How do you know when you have sufficiently good colleagues? In myexperience, when you do, you know. Which means if you\\'re unsure,you probably don\\'t. But it may be possible to give a more concreteanswer than that. Here\\'s an attempt: sufficiently good colleaguesoffersurprisinginsights. They can see and do things that youcan\\'t. So if you have a handful of colleagues good enough to keepyou on your toes in this sense, you\\'re probably over the threshold.Most of us can benefit from collaborating with colleagues, but someprojects require people on a larger scale, and starting one of thoseis not for everyone. If you want to run a project like that, you\\'llhave to become a manager, and managing well takes aptitude andinterest like any other kind of work. If you don\\'t have them, thereis no middle path: you must either force yourself to learn managementas a second language, or avoid such projects.Husband your morale. It\\'s the basis of everything when you\\'re workingon ambitious projects. You have to nurture and protect it like aliving organism.Morale starts with your view of life. You\\'re more likely to do greatwork if you\\'re an optimist, and more likely to if you think ofyourself as lucky than if you think of yourself as a victim.Indeed, work can to some extent protect you from your problems. Ifyou choose work that\\'s pure, its very difficulties will serve as arefuge from the difficulties of everyday life. If this is escapism,it\\'s a very productive form of it, and one that has been used bysome of the greatest minds in history.Morale compounds via work: high morale helps you do good work, whichincreases your morale and helps you do even better work. But thiscycle also operates in the other direction: if you\\'re not doinggood work, that can demoralize you and make it even harder to. Sinceit matters so much for this cycle to be running in the rightdirection, it can be a good idea to switch to easier work whenyou\\'re stuck, just so you start to get something done.One of the biggest mistakes ambitious people make is to allowsetbacks to destroy their morale all at once, like a balloon bursting.You can inoculate yourself against this by explicitly consideringsetbacks a part of your process. Solving hard problems alwaysinvolves some backtracking.Doing great work is a depth-first search whose root node is thedesire to. So \"If at first you don\\'t succeed, try, try again\" isn\\'tquite right. It should be: If at first you don\\'t succeed, eithertry again, or backtrack and then try again.\"Never give up\" is also not quite right. Obviously there are timeswhen it\\'s the right choice to eject. A more precise version wouldbe: Never let setbacks panic you into backtracking more than youneed to. Corollary: Never abandon the root node.It\\'s not necessarily a bad sign if work is a struggle, any morethan it\\'s a bad sign to be out of breath while running. It dependshow fast you\\'re running. So learn to distinguish good pain frombad. Good pain is a sign of effort; bad pain is a sign of damage.An audience is a critical component of morale. If you\\'re a scholar,your audience may be your peers; in the arts, it may be an audiencein the traditional sense. Either way it doesn\\'t need to be big.The value of an audience doesn\\'t grow anything like linearly withits size. Which is bad news if you\\'re famous, but good news ifyou\\'re just starting out, because it means a small but dedicatedaudience can be enough to sustain you. If a handful of peoplegenuinely love what you\\'re doing, that\\'s enough.To the extent you can, avoid letting intermediaries come betweenyou and your audience. In some types of work this is inevitable,but it\\'s so liberating to escape it that you might be better offswitching to an adjacent type if that will let you go direct.The people you spend time with will also have a big effect on yourmorale. You\\'ll find there are some who increase your energy andothers who decrease it, and the effect someone has is not alwayswhat you\\'d expect. Seek out the people who increase your energy andavoid those who decrease it. Though of course if there\\'s someoneyou need to take care of, that takes precedence.Don\\'t marry someone who doesn\\'t understand that you need to work,or sees your work as competition for your attention. If you\\'reambitious, you need to work; it\\'s almost like a medical condition;so someone who won\\'t let you work either doesn\\'t understand you,or does and doesn\\'t care.Ultimately morale is physical. You think with your body, so it\\'simportant to take care of it. That means exercising regularly,eating and sleeping well, and avoiding the more dangerous kinds ofdrugs. Running and walking are particularly good forms of exercisebecause they\\'re good for thinking.People who do great work are not necessarily happier than everyoneelse, but they\\'re happier than they\\'d be if they didn\\'t. In fact,if you\\'re smart and ambitious, it\\'s dangerousnotto be productive.People who are smart and ambitious but don\\'t achieve much tend tobecome bitter.It\\'s ok to want to impress other people, but choose the right people.The opinion of people you respect is signal. Fame, which is theopinion of a much larger group you might or might not respect, justadds noise.The prestige of a type of work is at best a trailing indicator andsometimes completely mistaken. If you do anything well enough,you\\'ll make it prestigious. So the question to ask about a type ofwork is not how much prestige it has, but how well it could be done.Competition can be an effective motivator, but don\\'t let it choosethe problem for you; don\\'t let yourself get drawn into chasingsomething just because others are. In fact, don\\'t let competitorsmake you do anything much more specific than work harder.Curiosity is the best guide. Your curiosity never lies, and it knowsmore than you do about what\\'s worth paying attention to.Notice how often that word has come up. If you asked an oracle thesecret to doing great work and the oracle replied with a singleword, my bet would be on \"curiosity.\"That doesn\\'t translate directly to advice. It\\'s not enough just tobe curious, and you can\\'t command curiosity anyway. But you cannurture it and let it drive you.Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it willchoose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you tonotice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them. The wholeprocess is a kind of dance with curiosity.Believe it or not, I tried to make this essay as short as I could.But its length at least means it acts as a filter. If you made itthis far, you must be interested in doing great work. And if soyou\\'re already further along than you might realize, because theset of people willing to want to is small.The factors in doing great work are factors in the literal,mathematical sense, and they are: ability, interest, effort, andluck. Luck by definition you can\\'t do anything about, so we canignore that. And we can assume effort, if you do in fact want todo great work. So the problem boils down to ability and interest.Can you find a kind of work where your ability and interest willcombine to yield an explosion of new ideas?Here there are grounds for optimism. There are so many differentways to do great work, and even more that are still undiscovered.Out of all those different types of work, the one you\\'re most suitedfor is probably a pretty close match. Probably a comically closematch. It\\'s just a question of finding it, and how far into it yourability and interest can take you. And you can only answer that bytrying.Many more people could try to do great work than do. What holdsthem back is a combination of modesty and fear. It seems presumptuousto try to be Newton or Shakespeare. It also seems hard; surely ifyou tried something like that, you\\'d fail. Presumably the calculationis rarely explicit. Few people consciously decide not to try to dogreat work. But that\\'s what\\'s going on subconsciously; they shyaway from the question.So I\\'m going to pull a sneaky trick on you. Do you want to do greatwork, or not? Now you have to decide consciously. Sorry about that.I wouldn\\'t have done it to a general audience. But we already knowyou\\'re interested.Don\\'t worry about being presumptuous. You don\\'t have to tell anyone.And if it\\'s too hard and you fail, so what? Lots of people haveworse problems than that. In fact you\\'ll be lucky if it\\'s the worstproblem you have.Yes, you\\'ll have to work hard. But again, lots of people have towork hard. And if you\\'re working on something you find veryinteresting, which you necessarily will if you\\'re on the right path,the work will probably feel less burdensome than a lot of yourpeers\\'.The discoveries are out there, waiting to be made.

       "  'essay_text': 'The web is turning writing into a conversation.  Twenty years ago,writers wrote and readers read.  The web lets readers respond, andincreasingly they do—in comment threads, on forums, and in theirown blog posts.Many who respond to something disagree with it.  That\\'s to beexpected.  Agreeing tends to motivate people less than disagreeing.And when you agree there\\'s less to say.  You could expand on somethingthe author said, but he has probably already explored themost interesting implications.  When you disagree you\\'re enteringterritory he may not have explored.The result is there\\'s a lot more disagreeing going on, especiallymeasured by the word.  That doesn\\'t mean people are getting angrier.The structural change in the way we communicate is enough to accountfor it.  But though it\\'s not anger that\\'s driving the increase indisagreement, there\\'s a danger that the increase in disagreementwill make people angrier.  Particularly online, where it\\'s easy tosay things you\\'d never say face to face.If we\\'re all going to be disagreeing more, we should be careful todo it well.  What does it mean to disagree well?   Most readers cantell the difference between mere name-calling and a carefullyreasoned refutation, but I think it would help to put names on theintermediate stages.  So here\\'s an attempt at a disagreementhierarchy:DH0. Name-calling.This is the lowest form of disagreement, and probably also the mostcommon.  We\\'ve all seen comments like this:u r a fag!!!!!!!!!!But it\\'s important to realize that more articulate name-calling hasjust as little weight.  A comment likeThe author is a self-important dilettante.is really nothing more than a pretentious version of \"u r a fag.\"DH1. Ad Hominem.An ad hominem attack is not quite as weak as mere name-calling.  Itmight actually carry some weight.  For example, if a senator wrotean article saying senators\\' salaries should be increased, one couldrespond:Of course he would say that.  He\\'s a senator.This wouldn\\'t refute the author\\'s argument, but it may at least berelevant to the case.  It\\'s still a very weak form of disagreement,though.  If there\\'s something wrong with the senator\\'s argument,you should say what it is; and if there isn\\'t, what difference doesit make that he\\'s a senator?Saying that an author lacks the authority to write about a topicis a variant of ad hominem—and a particularly useless sort, becausegood ideas often come from outsiders.  The question is whether theauthor is correct or not.  If his lack of authority caused him tomake mistakes, point those out.  And if it didn\\'t, it\\'s not aproblem.DH2. Responding to Tone.The next level up we start to see responses to the writing, ratherthan the writer.  The lowest form of these is to disagree with theauthor\\'s tone.  E.g.I can\\'t believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such  a cavalier fashion.Though better than attacking the author, this is still a weak formof disagreement.  It matters much more whether the author is wrongor right than what his tone is.  Especially since tone is so hardto judge.  Someone who has a chip on their shoulder about some topicmight be offended by a tone that to other readers seemed neutral.So if the worst thing you can say about something is to criticizeits tone, you\\'re not saying much.  Is the author flippant, butcorrect?  Better that than grave and wrong.  And if the author isincorrect somewhere, say where.DH3. Contradiction.In this stage we finally get responses to what was said, ratherthan how or by whom.  The lowest form of response to an argumentis simply to state the opposing case, with little or no supportingevidence.This is often combined with DH2 statements, as in:I can\\'t believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such  a cavalier fashion.  Intelligent design is a legitimate scientific  theory.Contradiction can sometimes have some weight.  Sometimes merelyseeing the opposing case stated explicitly is enough to see thatit\\'s right.  But usually evidence will help.DH4. Counterargument.At level 4 we reach the first form of convincing disagreement:counterargument.  Forms up to this point can usually be ignored asproving nothing.  Counterargument might prove something.  The problemis, it\\'s hard to say exactly what.Counterargument is contradiction plus reasoning and/or evidence.When aimed squarely at the original argument, it can be convincing.But unfortunately it\\'s common for counterarguments to be aimed atsomething slightly different.  More often than not, two peoplearguing passionately about something are actually arguing about twodifferent things.  Sometimes they even agree with one another, butare so caught up in their squabble they don\\'t realize it.There could be a legitimate reason for arguing against somethingslightly different from what the original author said: when youfeel they missed the heart of the matter.  But when you do that,you should say explicitly you\\'re doing it.DH5. Refutation.The most convincing form of disagreement is refutation.  It\\'s alsothe rarest, because it\\'s the most work.  Indeed, the disagreementhierarchy forms a kind of pyramid, in the sense that the higher yougo the fewer instances you find.To refute someone you probably have to quote them.  You have tofind a \"smoking gun,\" a passage in whatever you disagree with thatyou feel is mistaken, and then explain why it\\'s mistaken.  If youcan\\'t find an actual quote to disagree with, you may be arguingwith a straw man.While refutation generally entails quoting, quoting doesn\\'t necessarilyimply refutation.  Some writers quote parts of things they disagreewith to give the appearance of legitimate refutation, then followwith a response as low as DH3 or even DH0.DH6. Refuting the Central Point.The force of a refutation depends on what you refute.  The mostpowerful form of disagreement is to refute someone\\'s central point.Even as high as DH5 we still sometimes see deliberate dishonesty,as when someone picks out minor points of an argument and refutesthose.  Sometimes the spirit in which this is done makes it moreof a sophisticated form of ad hominem than actual refutation.  Forexample, correcting someone\\'s grammar, or harping on minor mistakesin names or numbers.  Unless the opposing argument actually dependson such things, the only purpose of correcting them is todiscredit one\\'s opponent.Truly refuting something requires one to refute its central point,or at least one of them.  And that means one has to commit explicitlyto what the central point is.  So a truly effective refutation wouldlook like:The author\\'s main point seems to be x.  As he says:<quotation>But this is wrong for the following reasons...The quotation you point out as mistaken need not be the actualstatement of the author\\'s main point.  It\\'s enough to refute somethingit depends upon.What It MeansNow we have a way of classifying forms of disagreement.  What goodis it?  One thing the disagreement hierarchydoesn\\'tgive us isa way of picking a winner.  DH levels merely describe the form ofa statement, not whether it\\'s correct.  A DH6 response could stillbe completely mistaken.But while DH levels don\\'t set a lower bound on the convincingnessof a reply, they do set an upper bound.  A DH6 response might beunconvincing, but a DH2 or lower response is always unconvincing.The most obvious advantage of classifying the forms of disagreementis that it will help people to evaluate what they read.  In particular,it will help them to see through intellectually dishonest arguments.An eloquent speaker or writer can give the impression of vanquishingan opponent merely by using forceful words.  In fact that is probablythe defining quality of a demagogue.  By giving names to the differentforms of disagreement, we give critical readers a pin for poppingsuch balloons.Such labels may help writers too.  Most intellectual dishonesty isunintentional.  Someone arguing against the tone of something hedisagrees with may believe he\\'s really saying something.  Zoomingout and seeing his current position on the disagreement hierarchymay inspire him to try moving up to counterargument or refutation.But the greatest benefit of disagreeing well is not just that itwill make conversations better, but that it will make the peoplewho have them happier.  If you study conversations, you find thereis a lot more meanness down in DH1 than up in DH6.  You don\\'t haveto be mean when you have a real point to make.  In fact, you don\\'twant to.  If you have something real to say, being mean just getsin the way.If moving up the disagreement hierarchy makes people less mean,that will make most of them happier.  Most people don\\'t really enjoybeing mean; they do it because they can\\'t help it.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.April 2001, rev. April 2003(This article is derived from a talk given at the 2001 FranzDeveloper Symposium.)In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and Istarted a startup calledViaweb.  Our plan was to writesoftware that would let end users build online stores.What was novel about this software, at the time, wasthat it ran on our server, using ordinary Web pagesas the interface.A lot of people could have been having this idea at thesame time, of course, but as far as I know, Viaweb wasthe first Web-based application.  It seemed sucha novel idea to us that we named the company after it:Viaweb, because our software worked via the Web,instead of running on your desktop computer.Another unusual thing about this software was that itwas written primarily in a programming language calledLisp. It was one of the first big end-userapplications to be written in Lisp, which up till thenhad been used mostly in universities and research labs. [1]The Secret WeaponEric Raymond has written an essay called \"How to Become a Hacker,\"and in it, among other things, he tells would-be hackers whatlanguages they should learn.  He suggests starting with Python andJava, because they are easy to learn.  The serious hacker will alsowant to learn C, in order to hack Unix, and Perl for systemadministration and cgi scripts.  Finally, the truly serious hackershould consider learning Lisp:Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience  you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make  you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you  never actually use Lisp itself a lot.This is the same argument you tend to hear for learning Latin.  Itwon\\'t get you a job, except perhaps as a classics professor, butit will improve your mind, and make you a better writer in languagesyou do want to use, like English.But wait a minute.  This metaphor doesn\\'t stretch that far.  Thereason Latin won\\'t get you a job is that no one speaks it.  If youwrite in Latin, no one can understand you.  But Lisp is a computerlanguage, and computers speak whatever language you, the programmer,tell them to.So if Lisp makes you a better programmer, like he says, why wouldn\\'tyou want to use it? If a painter were offered a brush that wouldmake him a better painter, it seems to me that he would want touse it in all his paintings, wouldn\\'t he? I\\'m not trying to makefun of Eric Raymond here.  On the whole, his advice is good.  Whathe says about Lisp is pretty much the conventional wisdom.  Butthere is a contradiction in the conventional wisdom:  Lisp willmake you a better programmer, and yet you won\\'t use it.Why not?  Programming languages are just tools, after all.  If Lispreally does yield better programs, you should use it.  And if itdoesn\\'t, then who needs it?This is not just a theoretical question.  Software is a verycompetitive business, prone to natural monopolies.  A company thatgets software written faster and better will, all other thingsbeing equal, put its competitors out of business.  And when you\\'restarting a startup, you feel this very keenly.  Startups tend tobe an all or nothing proposition.  You either get rich, or you getnothing.  In a startup, if you bet on the wrong technology, yourcompetitors will crush you.Robert and I both knew Lisp well, and we couldn\\'t see any reasonnot to trust our instincts and go with Lisp.  We knew that everyoneelse was writing their software in C++ or Perl.  But we also knewthat that didn\\'t mean anything.  If you chose technology that way,you\\'d be running Windows.  When you choose technology, you have toignore what other people are doing, and consider only what willwork the best.This is especially true in a startup.  In a big company, you cando what all the other big companies are doing.  But a startup can\\'tdo what all the other startups do.  I don\\'t think a lot of peoplerealize this, even in startups.The average big company grows at about ten percent a year.  So ifyou\\'re running a big company and you do everything the way theaverage big company does it, you can expect to do as well as theaverage big company-- that is, to grow about ten percent a year.The same thing will happen if you\\'re running a startup, of course.If you do everything the way the average startup does it, you shouldexpect average performance.  The problem here is, average performancemeans that you\\'ll go out of business.  The survival rate for startupsis way less than fifty percent.  So if you\\'re running a startup,you had better be doing something odd.  If not, you\\'re in trouble.Back in 1995, we knew something that I don\\'t think our competitorsunderstood, and few understand even now:  when you\\'re writingsoftware that only has to run on your own servers, you can useany language you want.  When you\\'re writing desktop software,there\\'s a strong bias toward writing applications in the samelanguage as the operating system.  Ten years ago, writing applicationsmeant writing applications in C.  But with Web-based software,especially when you have the source code of both the language andthe operating system, you can use whatever language you want.This new freedom is a double-edged sword, however.  Now that youcan use any language, you have to think about which one to use.Companies that try to pretend nothing has changed risk finding thattheir competitors do not.If you can use any language, which do you use?  We chose Lisp.For one thing, it was obvious that rapid development would beimportant in this market.  We were all starting from scratch, soa company that could get new features done before its competitorswould have a big advantage.  We knew Lisp was a really good languagefor writing software quickly, and server-based applications magnifythe effect of rapid development, because you can release softwarethe minute it\\'s done.If other companies didn\\'t want to use Lisp, so much the better.It might give us a technological edge, and we needed all the helpwe could get.  When we started Viaweb, we had no experience inbusiness.  We didn\\'t know anything about marketing, or hiringpeople, or raising money, or getting customers.  Neither of us hadever even had what you would call a real job.  The only thing wewere good at was writing software.  We hoped that would save us.Any advantage we could get in the software department, we wouldtake.So you could say that using Lisp was an experiment.  Our hypothesiswas that if we wrote our software in Lisp, we\\'d be able to getfeatures done faster than our competitors, and also to do thingsin our software that they couldn\\'t do.  And because Lisp was sohigh-level, we wouldn\\'t need a big development team, so our costswould be lower.  If this were so, we could offer a better productfor less money, and still make a profit.  We would end up gettingall the users, and our competitors would get none, and eventuallygo out of business.  That was what we hoped would happen, anyway.What were the results of this experiment?  Somewhat surprisingly,it worked.  We eventually had many competitors, on the order oftwenty to thirty of them, but none of their software could competewith ours.  We had a wysiwyg online store builder that ran on theserver and yet felt like a desktop application.  Our competitorshad cgi scripts.  And we were always far ahead of them in features.Sometimes, in desperation, competitors would try to introducefeatures that we didn\\'t have.  But with Lisp our development cyclewas so fast that we could sometimes duplicate a new feature withina day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release.  Bythe time journalists covering the press release got round to callingus, we would have the new feature too.It must have seemed to our competitors that we had some kind ofsecret weapon-- that we were decoding their Enigma traffic orsomething.  In fact we did have a secret weapon, but it was simplerthan they realized.  No one was leaking news of their features tous.   We were just able to develop software faster than anyonethought possible.When I was about nine I happened to get hold of a copy ofThe Dayof the Jackal,by Frederick Forsyth.  The main character is anassassin who is hired to kill the president of France.  The assassinhas to get past the police to get up to an apartment that overlooksthe president\\'s route.  He walks right by them, dressed up as anold man on crutches, and they never suspect him.Our secret weapon was similar.  We wrote our software in a weirdAI language, with a bizarre syntax full of parentheses.  For yearsit had annoyed me to hear Lisp described that way.  But now itworked to our advantage.  In business, there is nothing more valuablethan a technical advantage your competitors don\\'t understand.  Inbusiness, as in war, surprise is worth as much as force.And so, I\\'m a little embarrassed to say, I never said anythingpublicly about Lisp while we were working on Viaweb.  We nevermentioned it to the press, and if you searched for Lisp on our Website, all you\\'d find were the titles of two books in my bio.  Thiswas no accident.  A startup should give its competitors as littleinformation as possible.  If they didn\\'t know what language oursoftware was written in, or didn\\'t care, I wanted to keep it thatway.[2]The people who understood our technology best were the customers.They didn\\'t care what language Viaweb was written in either, butthey noticed that it worked really well.  It let them build greatlooking online stores literally in minutes.  And so, by word ofmouth mostly, we got more and more users.  By the end of 1996 wehad about 70 stores online.  At the end of 1997 we had 500.  Sixmonths later, when Yahoo bought us, we had 1070 users.  Today, asYahoo Store, this software continues to dominate its market.  It\\'sone of the more profitable pieces of Yahoo, and the stores builtwith it are the foundation of Yahoo Shopping.  I left Yahoo in1999, so I don\\'t know exactly how many users they have now, butthe last I heard there were about 20,000.The Blub ParadoxWhat\\'s so great about Lisp?  And if Lisp is so great, why doesn\\'teveryone use it?  These sound like rhetorical questions, but actuallythey have straightforward answers.  Lisp is so great not becauseof some magic quality visible only to devotees, but because it issimply the most powerful language available.  And the reason everyonedoesn\\'t use it is that programming languages are not merelytechnologies, but habits of mind as well, and nothing changesslower.  Of course, both these answers need explaining.I\\'ll begin with a shockingly controversial statement:  programminglanguages vary in power.Few would dispute, at least, that high level languages are morepowerful than machine language.  Most programmers today would agreethat you do not, ordinarily, want to program in machine language.Instead, you should program in a high-level language, and have acompiler translate it into machine language for you.  This idea iseven built into the hardware now: since the 1980s, instruction setshave been designed for compilers rather than human programmers.Everyone knows it\\'s a mistake to write your whole program by handin machine language.  What\\'s less often understood is that thereis a more general principle here: that if you have a choice ofseveral languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistaketo program in anything but the most powerful one. [3]There are many exceptions to this rule.  If you\\'re writing a programthat has to work very closely with a program written in a certainlanguage, it might be a good idea to write the new program in thesame language.  If you\\'re writing a program that only has to dosomething very simple, like number crunching or bit manipulation,you may as well use a less abstract language, especially since itmay be slightly faster.  And if you\\'re writing a short, throwawayprogram, you may be better off just using whatever language hasthe best library functions for the task.  But in general, forapplication software, you want to be using the most powerful(reasonably efficient) language you can get, and using anythingelse is a mistake, of exactly the same kind, though possibly in alesser degree, as programming in machine language.You can see that machine language is very low level.  But, at leastas a kind of social convention, high-level languages are often alltreated as equivalent.  They\\'re not.  Technically the term \"high-levellanguage\" doesn\\'t mean anything very definite.  There\\'s no dividingline with machine languages on one side and all the high-levellanguages on the other.  Languages fall along a continuum [4] ofabstractness, from the most powerful all the way down to machinelanguages, which themselves vary in power.Consider Cobol.  Cobol is a high-level language, in the sense thatit gets compiled into machine language.  Would anyone seriouslyargue that Cobol is equivalent in power to, say, Python?  It\\'sprobably closer to machine language than Python.Or how about Perl 4?  Between Perl 4 and Perl 5, lexical closuresgot added to the language.  Most Perl hackers would agree that Perl5 is more powerful than Perl 4.  But once you\\'ve admitted that,you\\'ve admitted that one high level language can be more powerfulthan another.  And it follows inexorably that, except in specialcases, you ought to use the most powerful you can get.This idea is rarely followed to its conclusion, though.  After acertain age, programmers rarely switch languages voluntarily.Whatever language people happen to be used to, they tend to considerjust good enough.Programmers get very attached to their favorite languages, and Idon\\'t want to hurt anyone\\'s feelings, so to explain this point I\\'mgoing to use a hypothetical language called Blub.  Blub falls rightin the middle of the abstractness continuum.  It is not the mostpowerful language, but it is more powerful than Cobol or machinelanguage.And in fact, our hypothetical Blub programmer wouldn\\'t use eitherof them.  Of course he wouldn\\'t program in machine language.  That\\'swhat compilers are for.  And as for Cobol, he doesn\\'t know howanyone can get anything done with it.  It doesn\\'t even have x (Blubfeature of your choice).As long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down thepower continuum, he knows he\\'s looking down.  Languages less powerfulthan Blub are obviously less powerful, because they\\'re missing somefeature he\\'s used to.  But when our hypothetical Blub programmerlooks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn\\'trealize he\\'s looking up.  What he sees are merely weird languages.He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, butwith all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well.  Blub is goodenough for him, because he thinks in Blub.When we switch to the point of view of a programmer using any ofthe languages higher up the power continuum, however, we find thathe in turn looks down upon Blub.  How can you get anything done inBlub? It doesn\\'t even have y.By induction, the only programmers in a position to see all thedifferences in power between the various languages are those whounderstand the most powerful one.  (This is probably what EricRaymond meant about Lisp making you a better programmer.) You can\\'ttrust the opinions of the others, because of the Blub paradox:they\\'re satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, becauseit dictates the way they think about programs.I know this from my own experience, as a high school kid writingprograms in Basic.  That language didn\\'t even support recursion.It\\'s hard to imagine writing programs without using recursion, butI didn\\'t miss it at the time.  I thought in Basic.  And I was awhiz at it.  Master of all I surveyed.The five languages that Eric Raymond recommends to hackers fall atvarious points on the power continuum.  Where they fall relativeto one another is a sensitive topic.  What I will say is that Ithink Lisp is at the top.  And to support this claim I\\'ll tell youabout one of the things I find missing when I look at the otherfour languages.  How can you get anything done in them, I think,without macros? [5]Many languages have something called a macro.  But Lisp macros areunique.  And believe it or not, what they do is related to theparentheses.  The designers of Lisp didn\\'t put all those parenthesesin the language just to be different.  To the Blub programmer, Lispcode looks weird.  But those parentheses are there for a reason.They are the outward evidence of a fundamental difference betweenLisp and other languages.Lisp code is made out of Lisp data objects.  And not in the trivialsense that the source files contain characters, and strings areone of the data types supported by the language.  Lisp code, afterit\\'s read by the parser, is made of data structures that you cantraverse.If you understand how compilers work, what\\'s really going on isnot so much that Lisp has a strange syntax as that Lisp has nosyntax.  You write programs in the parse trees that get generatedwithin the compiler when other languages are parsed.  But theseparse trees are fully accessible to your programs.  You can writeprograms that manipulate them.  In Lisp, these programs are calledmacros.  They are programs that write programs.Programs that write programs?  When would you ever want to do that?Not very often, if you think in Cobol.  All the time, if you thinkin Lisp.  It would be convenient here if I could give an exampleof a powerful macro, and say there! how about that?  But if I did,it would just look like gibberish to someone who didn\\'t know Lisp;there isn\\'t room here to explain everything you\\'d need to know tounderstand what it meant.  InAnsi Common LispI tried to movethings along as fast as I could, and even so I didn\\'t get to macrosuntil page 160.But I think I can give a kind of argument that might be convincing.The source code of the Viaweb editor was probably about 20-25%macros.  Macros are harder to write than ordinary Lisp functions,and it\\'s considered to be bad style to use them when they\\'re notnecessary.  So every macro in that code is there because it has tobe.  What that means is that at least 20-25% of the code in thisprogram is doing things that you can\\'t easily do in any otherlanguage.  However skeptical the Blub programmer might be about myclaims for the mysterious powers of Lisp, this ought to make himcurious.  We weren\\'t writing this code for our own amusement.  Wewere a tiny startup, programming as hard as we could in order toput technical barriers between us and our competitors.A suspicious person might begin to wonder if there was somecorrelation here.  A big chunk of our code was doing things thatare very hard to do in other languages.  The resulting softwaredid things our competitors\\' software couldn\\'t do.  Maybe there wassome kind of connection.  I encourage you to follow that thread.There may be more to that old man hobbling along on his crutchesthan meets the eye.Aikido for StartupsBut I don\\'t expect to convince anyone (over 25) to go out and learnLisp.  The purpose of this article is not to change anyone\\'s mind,but to reassure people already interested in using Lisp-- peoplewho know that Lisp is a powerful language, but worry because itisn\\'t widely used.  In a competitive situation, that\\'s an advantage.Lisp\\'s power is multiplied by the fact that your competitors don\\'tget it.If you think of using Lisp in a startup, you shouldn\\'t worry thatit isn\\'t widely understood.  You should hope that it stays thatway. And it\\'s likely to.  It\\'s the nature of programming languagesto make most people satisfied with whatever they currently use.Computer hardware changes so much faster than personal habits thatprogramming practice is usually ten to twenty years behind theprocessor.  At places like MIT they were writing programs inhigh-level languages in the early 1960s, but many companies continuedto write code in machine language well into the 1980s.  I bet alot of people continued to write machine language until the processor,like a bartender eager to close up and go home, finally kicked themout by switching to a risc instruction set.Ordinarily technology changes fast.  But programming languages aredifferent: programming languages are not just technology, but whatprogrammers think in.  They\\'re half technology and half religion.[6]And so the median language, meaning whatever language the medianprogrammer uses, moves as slow as an iceberg.  Garbage collection,introduced by Lisp in about 1960, is now widely considered to bea good thing.  Runtime typing, ditto, is growing in popularity.Lexical closures, introduced by Lisp in the early 1970s, are now,just barely, on the radar screen.  Macros, introduced by Lisp in themid 1960s, are still terra incognita.Obviously, the median language has enormous momentum.  I\\'m notproposing that you can fight this powerful force.  What I\\'m proposingis exactly the opposite: that, like a practitioner of Aikido, youcan use it against your opponents.If you work for a big company, this may not be easy.  You will havea hard time convincing the pointy-haired boss to let you buildthings in Lisp, when he has just read in the paper that some otherlanguage is poised, like Ada was twenty years ago, to take overthe world.  But if you work for a startup that doesn\\'t havepointy-haired bosses yet, you can, like we did, turn the Blubparadox to your advantage:  you can use technology that yourcompetitors, glued immovably to the median language, will never beable to match.If you ever do find yourself working for a startup, here\\'s a handytip for evaluating competitors.  Read their job listings.  Everythingelse on their site may be stock photos or the prose equivalent,but the job listings have to be specific about what they want, orthey\\'ll get the wrong candidates.During the years we worked on Viaweb I read a lot of job descriptions.A new competitor seemed to emerge out of the woodwork every monthor so.  The first thing I would do, after checking to see if theyhad a live online demo, was look at their job listings.  After acouple years of this I could tell which companies to worry aboutand which not to.  The more of an IT flavor the job descriptionshad, the less dangerous the company was.  The safest kind were theones that wanted Oracle experience.  You never had to worry aboutthose.  You were also safe if they said they wanted C++ or Javadevelopers.  If they wanted Perl or Python programmers, that wouldbe a bit frightening-- that\\'s starting to sound like a companywhere the technical side, at least, is run by real hackers.  If Ihad ever seen a job posting looking for Lisp hackers, I would havebeen really worried.'},\n",

The right way to liftheavy things is to let your legs do the work.  Inexperienced foundersmake the same mistake when trying to convince investors.  They tryto convince with their pitch.  Most would be better off if they lettheir startup do the work — if they started by understanding whytheir startup is worth investing in, then simply explained thiswell to investors.Investors are looking for startups that will be very successful.But that test is not as simple as it sounds.  In startups, as in alot of other domains, the distribution of outcomes follows a powerlaw, but in startups the curve is startlingly steep.  The bigsuccesses are so big theydwarfthe rest.  And since there are onlya handful each year (the conventional wisdom is 15), investors treat\"big success\" as if it were binary.  Most are interested in you ifyou seem like you have a chance, however small, of being one of the15 big successes, and otherwise not.(There are a handful of angels who\\'d be interested in a companywith a high probability of being moderately successful.  But angelinvestors like big successes too.)How do you seem like you\\'ll be one of the big successes?  You needthree things: formidable founders, a promising market, and (usually)some evidence of success so far.FormidableThe most important ingredient is formidable founders.  Most investorsdecide in the first few minutes whether you seem like a winner ora loser, and once their opinion is set it\\'s hard to change.Every startup has reasons both to invest and not to invest.  Ifinvestors think you\\'re a winner they focus on the former, and ifnot they focus on the latter.  For example, it might be a richmarket, but with a slow sales cycle.  If investors are impressedwith you as founders, they say they want to invest because it\\'s arich market, and if not, they say they can\\'t invest because of theslow sales cycle.They\\'re not necessarily trying to mislead you.  Most investors aregenuinely unclear in their own minds why they like or dislikestartups.  If you seem like a winner, they\\'ll like your idea more.But don\\'t be too smug about this weakness of theirs, because youhave it too; almost everyone does.There is a role for ideas of course.  They\\'re fuel for the firethat starts with liking the founders.  Once investors like you,you\\'ll see them reaching for ideas: they\\'ll be saying \"yes, and youcould also do x.\"  (Whereas when they don\\'t like you, they\\'ll besaying \"but what about y?\")But the foundation of convincing investors is to seem formidable,and since this isn\\'t a word most people use in conversation much,I should explain what it means.  A formidable person is one whoseems like they\\'ll get what they want, regardless of whateverobstacles are in the way.  Formidable is close to confident, exceptthat someone could be confident and mistaken.  Formidable is roughlyjustifiably confident.There are a handful of people who are really good at seemingformidable — some because they actually are very formidable andjust let it show, and others because they are more or less conartists.But most founders, including many who will go onto start very successful companies, are not that good at seemingformidable the first time they try fundraising.  What should theydo?What they should not do is try to imitate the swagger of moreexperienced founders.  Investors are not always that good at judgingtechnology, but they\\'re good at judging confidence.  If you try toact like something you\\'re not, you\\'ll just end up in an uncannyvalley.  You\\'ll depart from sincere, but never arrive at convincing.TruthThe way to seem most formidable as an inexperienced founder is tostick to the truth.   How formidable you seem isn\\'t a constant.  Itvaries depending on what you\\'re saying.  Most people can seemconfident when they\\'re saying \"one plus one is two,\" because theyknow it\\'s true.  The most diffident person would be puzzled andeven slightly contemptuous if they told a VC \"one plus one is two\"and the VC reacted with skepticism.  The magic ability of peoplewho are good at seeming formidable is that they can do this withthe sentence \"we\\'re going to make a billion dollars a year.\"  Butyou can do the same, if not with that sentence with some fairlyimpressive ones, so long as you convince yourself first.That\\'s the secret.  Convince yourself that your startup is worthinvesting in, and then when you explain this to investors they\\'llbelieve you.  And by convince yourself, I don\\'t mean play mind gameswith yourself to boost your confidence.  I mean truly evaluatewhether your startup is worth investing in.  If it isn\\'t, don\\'t tryto raise money.But if it is, you\\'ll be telling the truthwhen you tell investors it\\'s worth investing in, and they\\'ll sensethat.  You don\\'t have to be a smooth presenter if you understandsomething well and tell the truth about it.To evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in, you haveto be a domain expert.  If you\\'re not a domain expert, you can beas convinced as you like about your idea, and it will seem toinvestors no more than an instance of the Dunning-Kruger effect.Which in fact it will usually be.  And investors can tell fairlyquickly whether you\\'re a domain expert by how well you answer theirquestions.  Know everything about your market.Why do founders persist in trying to convince investors of thingsthey\\'re not convinced of themselves?  Partly because we\\'ve all beentrained to.When my friends Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell were in gradschool, one of their fellow students was on the receiving end of aquestion from their faculty advisor that we still quote today.  Whenthe unfortunate fellow got to his last slide, the professor burstout:Which one of these conclusions do you actually believe?One of the artifacts of the way schools are organized is that weall get trained to talk even when we have nothing to say.  If youhave a ten page paper due, then ten pages you must write, even ifyou only have one page of ideas.  Even if you have no ideas.  Youhave to produce something.  And all too many startups go intofundraising in the same spirit.  When they think it\\'s time to raisemoney, they try gamely to make the best case they can for theirstartup.  Most never think of pausing beforehand to ask whetherwhat they\\'re saying is actually convincing, because they\\'ve allbeen trained to treat the need to present as a given — as an areaof fixed size, over which however much truth they have must needsbe spread, however thinly.The time to raise money is not when you need it, or when you reachsome artificial deadline like a Demo Day.  It\\'s when you can convinceinvestors, and not before.And unless you\\'re a good con artist, you\\'ll never convince investorsif you\\'re not convinced yourself.  They\\'re far better at detectingbullshit than you are at producing it, even if you\\'re producing itunknowingly.  If you try to convince investors before you\\'ve convincedyourself, you\\'ll be wasting both your time.But pausing first to convince yourself will do more than save youfrom wasting your time.  It will force you to organize your thoughts.To convince yourself that your startup is worth investing in, you\\'llhave to figure out why it\\'s worth investing in.   And if you cando that you\\'ll end up with more than added confidence.  You\\'ll alsohave a provisional roadmap of how to succeed.MarketNotice I\\'ve been careful to talk about whether a startup is worthinvesting in, rather than whether it\\'s going to succeed.  No oneknows whether a startup is going to succeed.  And it\\'s a good thingfor investors that this is so, because if you could know in advancewhether a startup would succeed, the stock price would already bethe future price, and there would be no room for investors to makemoney.  Startup investors know that every investment is a bet, andagainst pretty long odds.So to prove you\\'re worth investing in, you don\\'t have to proveyou\\'re going to succeed, just that you\\'re a sufficiently good bet.What makes a startup a sufficiently good bet?  In addition toformidable founders, you need a plausible path to owning a big pieceof a big market.  Founders think of startups as ideas, but investorsthink of them as markets.  If there are x number of customers who\\'dpay an average of $y per year for what you\\'re making, then the totaladdressable market, or TAM, of your company is $xy.  Investors don\\'texpect you to collect all that money, but it\\'s an upper bound onhow big you can get.Your target market has to be big, and it also has to be capturableby you.  But the market doesn\\'t have to be big yet, nor do younecessarily have to be in it yet.  Indeed, it\\'s often better tostart in asmallmarket that will either turn into a big one orfrom which you can move into a big one.  There just has to be someplausible sequence of hops that leads to dominating a big market afew years down the line.The standard of plausibility varies dramatically depending on theage of the startup.  A three month old company at Demo Day onlyneeds to be a promising experiment that\\'s worth funding to see howit turns out.  Whereas a two year old company raising a series Around needs to be able to show the experiment worked.But every company that gets really big is \"lucky\" in the sense thattheir growth is due mostly to some external wave they\\'re riding,so to make a convincing case for becoming huge, you have to identifysome specific trend you\\'ll benefit from.  Usually you can find thisby asking \"why now?\"  If this is such a great idea, why hasn\\'tsomeone else already done it?  Ideally the answer is that it onlyrecently became a good idea, because something changed, and no oneelse has noticed yet.Microsoft for example was not going to grow huge selling Basicinterpreters.  But by starting there they were perfectly poised toexpand up the stack of microcomputer software as microcomputersgrew powerful enough to support one. And microcomputers turned outto be a really huge wave, bigger than even the most optimisticobservers would have predicted in 1975.But while Microsoft did really well and there is thus a temptationto think they would have seemed a great bet a few months in, theyprobably didn\\'t.  Good, but not great.  No company, however successful,ever looks more than a pretty good bet a few months in. Microcomputersturned out to be a big deal, and Microsoft both executed well andgot lucky.  But it was by no means obvious that this was how thingswould play out.  Plenty of companies seem as good a bet a few monthsin.  I don\\'t know about startups in general, but at least half thestartups we fund could make as good a case as Microsoft could havefor being on a path to dominating a large market.  And who canreasonably expect more of a startup than that?RejectionIf you can make as good a case as Microsoft could have, will youconvince investors?  Not always.  A lot of VCs would have rejectedMicrosoft.Certainly some rejected Google.  And gettingrejected will put you in a slightly awkward position, because asyou\\'ll see when you start fundraising, the most common questionyou\\'ll get from investors will be \"who else is investing?\" What doyou say if you\\'ve been fundraising for a while and no one hascommitted yet?The people who are really good at acting formidable often solvethis problem by giving investors the impression that while noinvestors have committed yet, several are about to.  This is arguablya permissible tactic.  It\\'s slightly dickish of investors to caremore about who else is investing than any other aspect of yourstartup, and misleading them about how far along you are with otherinvestors seems the complementary countermove.  It\\'s arguably aninstance of scamming a scammer. But I don\\'t recommend this approachto most founders, because most founders wouldn\\'t be able to carryit off.  This is the single most common lie told to investors, andyou have to be really good at lying to tell members of some professionthe most common lie they\\'re told.If you\\'re not a master of negotiation (and perhaps even if you are)the best solution is to tackle the problem head-on, and to explainwhy investors have turned you down and why they\\'re mistaken.  Ifyou know you\\'re on the right track, then you also know why investorswere wrong to reject you. Experienced investors are well aware thatthe best ideas are also the scariest.  They all know about the VCswho rejected Google.  If instead of seeming evasive and ashamedabout having been turned down (and thereby implicitly agreeing withthe verdict) you talk candidly about what scared investors aboutyou, you\\'ll seem more confident, which they like, and you\\'ll probablyalso do a better job of presenting that aspect of your startup.  Atthe very least, that worry will now be out in the open instead ofbeing a gotcha left to be discovered by the investors you\\'re currentlytalking to, who will be proud of and thus attached to their discovery.This strategy will work best with the best investors, who are bothhard to bluff and who already believe most other investors areconventional-minded drones doomed always to miss the big outliers.Raising money is not like applying to college, where you can assumethat if you can get into MIT, you can also get into Foobar State.Because the best investors are much smarter than the rest, and thebest startup ideas look initially likebad ideas, it\\'s not uncommonfor a startup to be rejected by all the VCs except the best ones.That\\'s what happened to Dropbox.  Y Combinator started in Boston,and for the first 3 years we ran alternating batches in Boston andSilicon Valley.  Because Boston investors were so few and so timid,we used to ship Boston batches out for a second Demo Day in SiliconValley.  Dropbox was part of a Boston batch, which means all thoseBoston investors got the first look at Dropbox, and none of themclosed the deal.  Yet another backup and syncing thing, they allthought.  A couple weeks later, Dropbox raised a series A roundfrom Sequoia.DifferentNot understanding that investors view investments as bets combineswith the ten page paper mentality to prevent founders from evenconsidering the possibility of being certain of what they\\'re saying.They think they\\'re trying to convince investors of something veryuncertain — that their startup will be huge — and convincing anyoneof something like that must obviously entail some wild feat ofsalesmanship.  But in fact when you raise money you\\'re trying toconvince investors of something so much less speculative — whetherthe company has all the elements of a good bet — that you canapproach the problem in a qualitatively different way.  You canconvince yourself, then convince them.And when you convince them, use the same matter-of-fact languageyou used to convince yourself.  You wouldn\\'t use vague, grandiosemarketing-speak among yourselves.  Don\\'t use it with investorseither.  It not only doesn\\'t work on them, but seems a mark ofincompetence.  Just be concise.  Many investors explicitly use thatas a test, reasoning (correctly) that if you can\\'t explain yourplans concisely, you don\\'t really understand them.  But even investorswho don\\'t have a rule about this will be bored and frustrated byunclear explanations.So here\\'s the recipe for impressing investors when you\\'re not alreadygood at seeming formidable:Make something worth investing in.Understand why it\\'s worth investing in.Explain that clearly to investors.If you\\'re saying something you know is true, you\\'ll seem confidentwhen you\\'re saying it.  Conversely, never let pitching draw youinto bullshitting.  As long as you stay on the territory of truth,you\\'re strong.  Make the truth good, then just tell it.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Everyone knows that to do great work you need both natural abilityand determination. But there\\'s a third ingredient that\\'s not aswell understood: an obsessive interest in a particular topic.To explain this point I need to burn my reputation with some groupof people, and I\\'m going to choose bus ticket collectors.  Thereare people who collect old bus tickets. Like many collectors, theyhave an obsessive interest in the minutiae of what they collect.They can keep track of distinctions between different types of bustickets that would be hard for the rest of us to remember.  Becausewe don\\'t care enough. What\\'s the point of spending so much timethinking about old bus tickets?Which leads us to the second feature of this kind of obsession:there is no point. A bus ticket collector\\'s love is disinterested.They\\'re not doing it to impress us or to make themselves rich, butfor its own sake.When you look at the lives of people who\\'ve done great work, yousee a consistent pattern. They often begin with a bus ticketcollector\\'s obsessive interest in something that would have seemedpointless to most of their contemporaries. One of the most strikingfeatures of Darwin\\'s book about his voyage on the Beagle is thesheer depth of his interest in natural history. His curiosity seemsinfinite. Ditto for Ramanujan, sitting by the hour working out onhis slate what happens to series.It\\'s a mistake to think they were \"laying the groundwork\" for thediscoveries they made later. There\\'s too much intention in thatmetaphor. Like bus ticket collectors, they were doing itbecause they liked it.But there is a difference between Ramanujan and a bus ticketcollector. Series matter, and bus tickets don\\'t.If I had to put the recipe for genius into one sentence, that mightbe it: to have a disinterested obsession with something that matters.Aren\\'t I forgetting about the other two ingredients? Less than youmight think. An obsessive interest in a topic is both a proxy forability and a substitute for determination.  Unless you havesufficient mathematical aptitude, you won\\'t find series interesting.And when you\\'re obsessively interested in something, you don\\'t needas much determination: you don\\'t need to push yourself as hard whencuriosity is pulling you.An obsessive interest will even bring you luck, to the extentanything can. Chance, as Pasteur said, favors the prepared mind,and if there\\'s one thing an obsessed mind is, it\\'s prepared.The disinterestedness of this kind of obsession is its most importantfeature. Not just because it\\'s a filter for earnestness, but becauseit helps you discover new ideas.The paths that lead to new ideas tend to look unpromising. If theylooked promising, other people would already have explored them.How do the people who do great work discover these paths that othersoverlook?  The popular story is that they simply have better vision:because they\\'re so talented, they see paths that others miss.  Butif you look at the way great discoveries are made, that\\'s not whathappens. Darwin didn\\'t pay closer attention to individual speciesthan other people because he saw that this would lead to greatdiscoveries, and they didn\\'t. He was just really, really interestedin such things.Darwin couldn\\'t turn it off. Neither could Ramanujan.  They didn\\'tdiscover the hidden paths that they did because they seemed promising,but because they couldn\\'t help it. That\\'s what allowed them tofollow paths that someone who was merely ambitious would haveignored.What rational person would decide that the way to write great novelswas to begin by spending several years creating an imaginary elvishlanguage, like Tolkien, or visiting every household in southwesternBritain, like Trollope? No one, including Tolkien and Trollope.The bus ticket theory is similar to Carlyle\\'s famous definition ofgenius as an infinite capacity for taking pains. But there are twodifferences. The bus ticket theory makes it clear that the sourceof this infinite capacity for taking pains is not infinite diligence,as Carlyle seems to have meant, but the sort of infinite interestthat collectors have. It also adds an important qualification: aninfinite capacity for taking pains about something that matters.So what  matters? You can never be sure. It\\'s precisely because noone can tell in advance which paths are promising that you candiscover new ideas by working on what you\\'re interested in.But there are some heuristics you can use to guess whether anobsession might be one that matters. For example, it\\'s more promisingif you\\'re creating something, rather than just consuming somethingsomeone else creates. It\\'s more promising if something you\\'reinterested in is difficult, especially if it\\'smore difficult forother peoplethan it is for you. And the obsessions of talentedpeople are more likely to be promising. When talented people becomeinterested in random things, they\\'re not truly random.But you can never be sure. In fact, here\\'s an interesting ideathat\\'s also rather alarming if it\\'s true: it may be that to do greatwork, you also have to waste a lot of time.In many different areas, reward is proportionate to risk. If thatrule holds here, then the way to find paths that lead to truly greatwork is to be willing to expend a lot of effort on things that turnout to be every bit as unpromising as they seem.I\\'m not sure if this is true. On one hand, it seems surprisinglydifficult to waste your time so long as you\\'re working hard onsomething interesting. So much of what you do ends up being useful.But on the other hand, the rule about the relationship between riskand reward is so powerful that it seems to hold wherever risk occurs.Newton\\'scase, at least, suggests that the risk/reward rule holdshere. He\\'s famous for one particular obsession of his that turnedout to be unprecedentedly fruitful: using math to describe theworld. But he had two other obsessions, alchemy and theology, thatseem to have been complete wastes of time. He ended up net ahead.His bet on what we now call physics paid off so well that it morethan compensated for the other two. But were the other two necessary,in the sense that he had to take big risks to make such bigdiscoveries? I don\\'t know.Here\\'s an even more alarming idea: might one make all bad bets?  Itprobably happens quite often. But we don\\'t know how often, becausethese people don\\'t become famous.It\\'s not merely that the returns from following a path are hard topredict. They change dramatically over time. 1830 was a really goodtime to be obsessively interested in natural history. If Darwin hadbeen born in 1709 instead of 1809, we might never have heard ofhim.What can one do in the face of such uncertainty?  One solution isto hedge your bets, which in this case means to follow the obviouslypromising paths instead of your own private obsessions. But as withany hedge, you\\'re decreasing reward when you decrease risk.  If youforgo working on what you like in order to follow some moreconventionally ambitious path, you might miss something wonderfulthat you\\'d otherwise have discovered. That too must happen all thetime, perhaps even more often than the genius whose bets all fail.The other solution is to let yourself be interested in lots ofdifferent things. You don\\'t decrease your upside if you switchbetween equally genuine interests based on which seems to be workingso far. But there is a danger here too: if you work on too manydifferent projects, you might not get deeply enough into any ofthem.One interesting thing about the bus ticket theory is that it mayhelp explain why different types of people excel at different kindsof work. Interest is much more unevenly distributed than ability.If natural ability is all you need to do great work, and naturalability is evenly distributed, you have to invent elaborate theoriesto explain the skewed distributions we see among those who actuallydo great work in various fields. But it may be that much of theskew has a simpler explanation: different people are interested indifferent things.The bus ticket theory also explains why people are less likely todo great work after they have children. Here interest has to competenot just with external obstacles, but with another interest, andone that for most people is extremely powerful. It\\'s harder to findtime for work after you have kids, but that\\'s the easy part. Thereal change is that you don\\'twantto.But the most exciting implication of the bus ticket theory is thatit suggests ways to encourage great work. If the recipe for geniusis simply natural ability plus hard work, all we can do is hope wehave a lot of ability, and work as hard as we can. But if interestis a critical ingredient in genius, we may be able, by cultivatinginterest, to cultivate genius.For example, for the very ambitious, the bus ticket theory suggeststhat the way to do great work is to relax a little. Instead ofgritting your teeth and diligently pursuing what all your peersagree is the most promising line of research, maybe you should trydoing something just for fun. And if you\\'re stuck, that may be thevector along which to break out.I\\'ve always likedHamming\\'sfamous double-barrelled question: whatare the most important problems in your field, and why aren\\'t youworking on one of them? It\\'s a great way to shake yourself up. Butit may be overfitting a bit. It might be at least as useful to askyourself: if you could take a year off to work on something thatprobably wouldn\\'t be important but would be really interesting,what would it be?The bus ticket theory also suggests a way to avoid slowing down asyou get older. Perhaps the reason people have fewer new ideas asthey get older is not simply that they\\'re losing their edge. It mayalso be because once you become established, you can no longer messabout with irresponsible side projects the way you could when youwere young and no one cared what you did.The solution to that is obvious: remain irresponsible. It will behard, though, because the apparently random projects you take upto stave off decline will read to outsiders as evidence of it.  Andyou yourself won\\'t know for sure that they\\'re wrong. But it willat least be more fun to work on what you want.It may even be that we can cultivate a habit of intellectual busticket collecting in kids. The usual plan in education is to startwith a broad, shallow focus, then gradually become more specialized.But I\\'ve done the opposite with my kids. I know I can count on theirschool to handle the broad, shallow part, so I take them deep.When they get interested in something, however random, I encouragethem to go preposterously, bus ticket collectorly, deep.  I don\\'tdo this because of the bus ticket theory. I do it because I wantthem to feel the joy of learning, and they\\'re never going to feelthat about something I\\'m making them learn. It has to be somethingthey\\'re interested in. I\\'m just following the path of least resistance;depth is a byproduct. But if in trying to show them the joy oflearning I also end up training them to go deep, so much the better.Will it have any effect? I have no idea. But that uncertainty maybe the most interesting point of all. There is so much more to learnabout how to do great work. As old as human civilization feels,it\\'s really still very young if we haven\\'t nailed something sobasic. It\\'s exciting to think there are still discoveries to makeabout discovery. If that\\'s the sort of thing you\\'re interested in.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'A few days ago, on the way home from school, my nine year old sontold me he couldn\\'t wait to get home to write more of the story hewas working on. This made me as happy as anything I\\'ve heard himsay — not just because he was excited about his story, but becausehe\\'d discovered this way of working. Working on a project of yourown is as different from ordinary work as skating is from walking.It\\'s more fun, but also much more productive.What proportion of great work has been done by people who wereskating in this sense? If not all of it, certainly a lot.There is something special about working on a project of your own.I wouldn\\'t say exactly that you\\'re happier. A better word would beexcited, or engaged. You\\'re happy when things are going well, butoften they aren\\'t. When I\\'m writing an essay, most of the time I\\'mworried and puzzled: worried that the essay will turn out badly,and puzzled because I\\'m groping for some idea that I can\\'t seeclearly enough. Will I be able to pin it down with words? In theend I usually can, if I take long enough, but I\\'m never sure; thefirst few attempts often fail.You have moments of happiness when things work out, but they don\\'tlast long, because then you\\'re on to the next problem. So why doit at all? Because to the kind of people who like working this way,nothing else feels as right. You feel as if you\\'re an animal in itsnatural habitat, doing what you were meant to do — not alwayshappy, maybe, but awake and alive.Many kids experience the excitement of working on projects of theirown. The hard part is making this converge with the work you do asan adult. And our customs make it harder. We treat \"playing\" and\"hobbies\" as qualitatively different from \"work\". It\\'s not clearto a kid building a treehouse that there\\'s a direct (though long)route from that to architecture or engineering. And instead ofpointing out the route, we conceal it, by implicitly treating thestuff kids do as different from real work.Instead of telling kids that their treehouses could be on the pathto the work they do as adults, we tell them the path goes throughschool. And unfortunately schoolwork tends to be very different fromworking on projects of one\\'s own. It\\'s usually neither a project,nor one\\'s own. So as school gets more serious, working on projectsof one\\'s own is something that survives, if at all, as a thin threadoff to the side.It\\'s a bit sad to think of all the high school kids turning theirbacks on building treehouses and sitting in class dutifully learningabout Darwin or Newton to pass some exam, when the work that madeDarwin and Newton famous was actually closer in spirit to buildingtreehouses than studying for exams.If I had to choose between my kids getting good grades and working on ambitious projects of their own, I\\'d pickthe projects. And not because I\\'m an indulgent parent, but becauseI\\'ve been on the other end and I know which has more predictivevalue. When I was picking startups for Y Combinator, I didn\\'t careabout applicants\\' grades. But if they\\'d worked on projects of theirown, I wanted to hear all about those.It may be inevitable that school is the way it is. I\\'m not sayingwe have to redesign it (though I\\'m not saying we don\\'t), just thatwe should understand what it does to our attitudes to work — thatit steers us toward the dutiful plodding kind of work, often usingcompetition as bait, and away from skating.There are occasionally times when schoolwork becomes a project ofone\\'s own. Whenever I had to write a paper, that would become aproject of my own — except in English classes, ironically, becausethe things one has to write in English classes are sobogus. Andwhen I got to college and started taking CS classes, the programsI had to write became projects of my own. Whenever I was writingor programming, I was usually skating, and that has been true eversince.So where exactly is the edge of projects of one\\'s own? That\\'s aninteresting question, partly because the answer is so complicated,and partly because there\\'s so much at stake. There turn out to betwo senses in which work can be one\\'s own: 1) that you\\'re doing itvoluntarily, rather than merely because someone told you to, and2) that you\\'re doing it by yourself.The edge of the former is quite sharp. People who care a lot abouttheir work are usually very sensitive to the difference betweenpulling, and being pushed, and work tends to fall into one categoryor the other. But the test isn\\'t simply whether you\\'re told to dosomething. You can choose to do something you\\'re told to do. Indeed,you can own it far more thoroughly than the person who told you todo it.For example, math homework is for most people something they\\'retold to do. But for my father, who was a mathematician, it wasn\\'t.Most of us think of the problems in a math book as a way to testor develop our knowledge of the material explained in each section.But to my father the problems were the part that mattered, and thetext was merely a sort of annotation. Whenever he got a new mathbook it was to him like being given a puzzle: here was a new setof problems to solve, and he\\'d immediately set about solving allof them.The other sense of a project being one\\'s own — working on it byoneself — has a much softer edge. It shades gradually intocollaboration. And interestingly, it shades into collaboration intwo different ways. One way to collaborate is to share a singleproject. For example, when two mathematicians collaborate on a proofthat takes shape in the course of a conversation between them. Theother way is when multiple people work on separate projects of theirown that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. For example, when oneperson writes the text of a book and another does the graphic design.These two paths into collaboration can of course be combined. Butunder the right conditions, the excitement of working on a projectof one\\'s own can be preserved for quite a while before disintegratinginto the turbulent flow of work in a large organization. Indeed,the history of successful organizations is partly the history oftechniques for preserving that excitement.The team that made the original Macintosh were a great example ofthis phenomenon. People like Burrell Smith and Andy Hertzfeld andBill Atkinson and Susan Kare were not just following orders. Theywere not tennis balls hit by Steve Jobs, but rockets let loose bySteve Jobs. There was a lot of collaboration between them, butthey all seem to have individually felt the excitement ofworking on a project of one\\'s own.In Andy Hertzfeld\\'s book on the Macintosh, he describes how they\\'dcome back into the office after dinner and work late into the night.People who\\'ve never experienced the thrill of working on a projectthey\\'re excited about can\\'t distinguish this kind of working longhours from the kind that happens in sweatshops and boiler rooms,but they\\'re at opposite ends of the spectrum. That\\'s why it\\'s amistake to insist dogmatically on \"work/life balance.\" Indeed, themere expression \"work/life\" embodies a mistake: it assumes work andlife are distinct. For those to whom the word \"work\" automaticallyimplies the dutiful plodding kind, they are. But for the skaters,the relationship between work and life would be better representedby a dash than a slash. I wouldn\\'t want to work on anything that I didn\\'twant to take over my life.Of course, it\\'s easier to achieve this level of motivation whenyou\\'re making something like the Macintosh. It\\'s easy for somethingnew to feel like a project of your own. That\\'s one of the reasonsfor the tendency programmers have to rewrite things that don\\'t needrewriting, and to write their own versions of things that alreadyexist. This sometimes alarms managers, and measured by total numberof characters typed, it\\'s rarely the optimal solution. But it\\'s notalways driven simply by arrogance or cluelessness.Writing code from scratch is also much more rewarding — so muchmore rewarding that a good programmer can end up net ahead, despitethe shocking waste of characters. Indeed, it may be one of theadvantages of capitalism that it encourages such rewriting. A companythat needs software to do something can\\'t use the software alreadywritten to do it at another company, and thus has to write theirown, which often turns out better.The natural alignment between skating and solving new problems isone of the reasons the payoffs from startups are so high. Not onlyis the market price of unsolved problems higher, you also get adiscount on productivity when you work on them. In fact, you get adouble increase in productivity: when you\\'re doing a clean-sheetdesign, it\\'s easier to recruit skaters, and they get to spend alltheir time skating.Steve Jobs knew a thing or two about skaters from having watchedSteve Wozniak. If you can find the right people, you only have totell them what to do at the highest level. They\\'ll handle thedetails. Indeed, they insist on it. For a project to feel like yourown, you must have sufficient autonomy. You can\\'t be working toorder, orslowed downby bureaucracy.One way to ensure autonomy is not to have a boss at all. There aretwo ways to do that: to be the boss yourself, and to work on projectsoutside of work. Though they\\'re at opposite ends of the scalefinancially, startups and open source projects have a lot in common,including the fact that they\\'re often run by skaters. And indeed,there\\'s a wormhole from one end of the scale to the other: one ofthe best ways to discoverstartup ideasis to work on a projectjust for fun.If your projects are the kind that make money, it\\'s easy to workon them. It\\'s harder when they\\'re not. And the hardest part, usually,is morale. That\\'s where adults have it harder than kids. Kids justplunge in and build their treehouse without worrying about whetherthey\\'re wasting their time, or how it compares to other treehouses.And frankly we could learn a lot from kids here. The high standardsmost grownups have for \"real\" work do not always serve us well.The most important phase in a project of one\\'s own is at thebeginning: when you go from thinking it might be cool to do x toactually doing x. And at that point high standards are not merelyuseless but positively harmful. There are a few people who starttoo many new projects, but far more, I suspect, who are deterredby fear of failure from starting projects that would have succeededif they had.But if we couldn\\'t benefit as kids from the knowledge that ourtreehouses were on the path to grownup projects, we can at leastbenefit as grownups from knowing that our projects are on a paththat stretches back to treehouses. Remember that careless confidenceyou had as a kid when starting something new? That would be apowerful thing to recapture.If it\\'s harder as adults to retain that kind of confidence, we atleast tend to be more aware of what we\\'re doing. Kids bounce, orare herded, from one kind of work to the next, barely realizingwhat\\'s happening to them. Whereas we know more about different typesof work and have more control over which we do. Ideally we can havethe best of both worlds: to be deliberate in choosing to work onprojects of our own, and carelessly confident in starting new ones.'},\n",

       "  'date': 'December 2008',\n",
       "  'essay_text': '(I originally wrote this at the request of a company producinga report about entrepreneurship.  Unfortunately after reading itthey decided  it was too controversial to include.)VC funding will probably dry up somewhat during the present recession,like it usually does in bad times.  But this time the result maybe different.  This time the number of new startups may not decrease.And that could be dangerous for VCs.When VC funding dried up after the Internet Bubble, startups driedup too.   There were not a lot of new startups being founded in2003.  But startups aren\\'t tied to VC the way they were 10 yearsago.  It\\'s now possible for VCs and startups to diverge.  And ifthey do, they may not reconverge once the economy gets better.The reason startups no longer depend so much on VCs is one thateveryone in the startup business knows by now: it has gotten muchcheaper to start a startup.  There are four main reasons: Moore\\'slaw has made hardware cheap; open source has made software free;the web has made marketing and distribution free; and more powerfulprogramming languages mean development teams can be smaller.  Thesechanges have pushed the cost of starting a startup down into thenoise.  In a lot of startups—probaby most startups funded byY Combinator—the biggest expense is simply the founders\\'living expenses.  We\\'ve had startups that were profitable on revenuesof $3000 a month.$3000 is insignificant as revenues go.  Why should anyone care abouta startup making $3000 a month?  Because, although insignificantasrevenue, this amount of money can change a startup\\'sfundingsituation completely.Someone running a startup is always calculating in the back of theirmind how much \"runway\" they have—how long they have till themoney in the bank runs out and they either have to be profitable,raise more money, or go out of business.  Once you cross the thresholdof profitability, however low, your runway becomes infinite.  It\\'sa qualitative change, like the stars turning into lines anddisappearing when the Enterprise accelerates to warp speed.  Onceyou\\'re profitable you don\\'t need investors\\' money.  And becauseInternet startups have become so cheap to run, the threshold ofprofitability can be trivially low.  Which means many Internetstartups don\\'t need VC-scale investments anymore.  For many startups,VC funding has, in the language of VCs, gone from a must-have to anice-to-have.This change happened while no one was looking, and its effects havebeen largely masked so far.  It was during the trough after theInternet Bubble that it became trivially cheap to start a startup,but few realized it because startups were so out of fashion.   Whenstartups came back into fashion, around 2005, investors were startingto write checks again.  And while founders may not have needed VCmoney the way they used to, they were willing to take it ifoffered—partly because there was a tradition of startupstaking VC money, and partly because startups, like dogs, tend toeat when given the opportunity.  As long as VCs were writing checks,founders were never forced to explore the limits of how little theyneeded them.  There were a few startups who hit these limitsaccidentally because of their unusual circumstances—mostfamously 37signals, which hit the limit because they crossed intostartup land from the other direction: they started as a consultingfirm, so they had revenue before they had a product.VCs and founders are like two components that used to be boltedtogether.  Around 2000 the bolt was removed.  Because the componentshave so far been subjected to the same forces, they still seem tobe joined together, but really one is just resting on the other.A sharp impact would make them fly apart.  And the present recessioncould be that impact.Because of Y Combinator\\'s position at the extreme end of the spectrum,we\\'d be the first to see signs of a separation between founders andinvestors, and we are in fact seeing it.  For example, though thestock market crash does seem to have made investors more cautious,it doesn\\'t seem to have had any effect on the number of people whowant to start startups.  We take applications for funding every 6months.  Applications for the current funding cycle closed on October17, well after the markets tanked, and even so we got a recordnumber, up 40% from the same cycle a year before.Maybe things will be different a year from now, if the economycontinues to get worse, but so far there is zero slackening ofinterest among potential founders.  That\\'s different from the waythings felt in 2001.  Then there was a widespread feeling amongpotential founders that startups were over, and that one shouldjust go to grad school.   That isn\\'t happening this time, and partof the reason is that even in a bad economy it\\'s not that hard tobuild something that makes $3000 a month.  If investors stop writingchecks, who cares?We also see signs of a divergence between founders and investorsin the attitudes of existing startups we\\'ve funded.  I was talkingto one recently that had a round fall through at the last minuteover the sort of trifle that breaks deals when investors feel theyhave the upper hand—over an uncertainty about whether thefounders had correctly filed their 83(b) forms, if you can believethat.  And yet this startup is obviously going to succeed: theirtraffic and revenue graphs look like a jet taking off.  So I askedthem if they wanted me to introduce them to more investors.  To mysurprise, they said no—that they\\'d just spent four monthsdealing with investors, and they were actually a lot happier nowthat they didn\\'t have to.  There was a friend they wanted to hirewith the investor money, and now they\\'d have to postpone that.  Butotherwise they felt they had enough in the bank to make it toprofitability.  To make sure, they were moving to a cheaper apartment.And in this economy I bet they got a good deal on it.I\\'ve detected this \"investors aren\\'t worth the trouble\" vibe fromseveral YC founders I\\'ve talked to recently.  At least one startupfrom the most recent (summer) cycle may not even raise angel money,let alone VC.Ticketstumblermade it to profitability on Y Combinator\\'s $15,000 investment andthey hope not to need more.  This surprised even us.  Although YCis based on the idea of it being cheap to start a startup, we neveranticipated that founders would grow successful startups on nothingmore than YC funding.If founders decide VCs aren\\'t worth the trouble, that could be badfor VCs.  When the economy bounces back in a few years and they\\'reready to write checks again, they may find that founders have movedon.There is a founder community just as there\\'s a VC community.  Theyall know one another, and techniques spread rapidly between them.If one tries a new programming language or a new hosting providerand gets good results, 6 months later half of them are using it.And the same is true for funding.  The current generation of founderswant to raise money from VCs, and Sequoia specifically, becauseLarry and Sergey took money from VCs, and Sequoia specifically.Imagine what it would do to the VC business if the next hot companydidn\\'t take VC at all.VCs think they\\'re playing a zero sum game.

       "  'essay_text': 'Increcently asked me who I thought were the 5 mostinteresting startup founders of the last 30 years.  How doyou decide who\\'s the most interesting?  The best test seemedto be influence: who are the 5who\\'ve influenced me most?  Who do I use as examples when I\\'mtalking to companies we fund?  Who do I find myself quoting?1. Steve JobsI\\'d guess Steve is the most influential founder not just for me butfor most people you could ask.  A lot of startup culture is Appleculture.  He was the original young founder.  And while the conceptof \"insanely great\" already existed in the arts, it was a novelidea to introduce into a company in the 1980s.More remarkable still, he\\'s stayed interesting for 30 years.  Peopleawait new Apple products the way they\\'d await new books by a popularnovelist.  Steve may not literally design them, but they wouldn\\'thappen if he weren\\'t CEO.Steve is clever and driven, but so are a lot of people in the Valley.What makes him unique is hissense of design.  Before him, mostcompanies treated design as a frivolous extra.  Apple\\'s competitorsnow know better.2. TJ RodgersTJ Rodgers isn\\'t as famous as Steve Jobs, but he may be the bestwriter among Silicon Valley CEOs.  I\\'ve probably learned more fromhim about the startup way of thinking than from anyone else.  Notso much from specific things he\\'s written as by reconstructing themind that produced them: brutally candid; aggressively garbage-collectingoutdated ideas; and yet driven by pragmatism rather than ideology.The first essay of his that I read was so electrifying that Iremember exactly where I was at the time.  It wasHighTechnology Innovation: Free Markets or Government Subsidies?andI was downstairs in the Harvard Square T Station.  It felt as ifsomeone had flipped on a light switch inside my head.3. Larry & SergeyI\\'m sorry to treat Larry and Sergey as one person.  I\\'ve alwaysthought that was unfair to them.  But it does seem as if Google was acollaboration.Before Google, companies in Silicon Valley already knew it wasimportant to have the best hackers.  So they claimed, at least.But Google pushed this idea further than anyone had before.  Theirhypothesis seems to have been that, in the initial stages at least,allyou need is good hackers: if you hire all the smartest peopleand put them to work on a problem where their success can be measured,you win.  All the other stuff—which includes all the stuff thatbusiness schools think business consists of—you can figure outalong the way.  The results won\\'t be perfect, but they\\'ll be optimal.If this was their hypothesis, it\\'s now been verified experimentally.4. Paul BuchheitFew know this, but one person, Paul Buchheit, is responsible forthree of the best things Google has done.  He was the originalauthor of GMail, which is the most impressive thing Google has aftersearch.  He also wrote the first prototype of AdSense, and was theauthor of Google\\'s mantra \"Don\\'t be evil.\"PB made a point in a talk once that I now mention to every startupwe fund: that it\\'s better, initially, to make a small number ofusers really love you than a large number kind of like you.   If Icould tell startups onlyten sentences, this would be one of them.Now he\\'s cofounder of a startup called Friendfeed.  It\\'s only ayear old, but already everyone in the Valley is watching them.Someone responsible for three of the biggest ideas at Google isgoing to come up with more.5. Sam AltmanI was told I shouldn\\'t mention founders of YC-funded companies inthis list.   But Sam Altman can\\'t be stopped by such flimsy rules.If he wants to be on this list, he\\'s going to be.Honestly, Sam is, along with Steve Jobs, the founder I refer tomost when I\\'m advising startups.  On questions of design, I ask\"What would Steve do?\" but on questions of strategy or ambition Iask \"What would Sama do?\"What I learned from meeting Sama is that the doctrine of the electapplies to startups.  It applies way less than most people think:startup investing does not consist of trying to pick winners theway you might in a horse race.

       "  'essay_text': 'When we were in junior high school, my friend Rich and I made a mapof the school lunch tables according to popularity. This was easyto do, because kids only ate lunch with others of about the samepopularity. We graded them from A to E. A tables were full offootball players and cheerleaders and so on. E tables contained thekids with mild cases of Down\\'s Syndrome, what in the language ofthe time we called \"retards.\"We sat at a D table, as low as you could get without lookingphysically different. We were not being especially candid to gradeourselves as D. It would have taken a deliberate lie to say otherwise.Everyone in the school knew exactly how popular everyone else was,including us.My stock gradually rose during high school. Puberty finally arrived;I became a decent soccer player; I started a scandalous undergroundnewspaper.  So I\\'ve seen a good part of the popularity landscape.I know a lot of people who were nerds in school, and they all tellthe same story: there is a strong correlation between being smartand being a nerd, and an even stronger inverse correlation betweenbeing a nerd and being popular. Being smart seems tomakeyouunpopular.Why? To someone in school now, that may seem an odd question toask. The mere fact is so overwhelming that it may seem strange toimagine that it could be any other way. But it could. Being smartdoesn\\'t make you an outcast in elementary school. Nor does it harmyou in the real world. Nor, as far as I can tell, is the problemso bad in most other countries. But in a typical American secondaryschool, being smart is likely to make your life difficult.  Why?The key to this mystery is to rephrase the question slightly. Whydon\\'t smart kids make themselves popular? If they\\'re so smart, whydon\\'t they figure out how popularity works and beat the system,just as they do for standardized tests?One argument says that this would be impossible, that the smartkids are unpopular because the other kids envy them for being smart,and nothing they could do could make them popular. I wish. If theother kids in junior high school envied me, they did a great jobof concealing it. And in any case, if being smart were really anenviable quality, the girls would have broken ranks. The guys thatguys envy, girls like.In the schools I went to, being smart just didn\\'t matter much. Kidsdidn\\'t admire it or despise it. All other things being equal, theywould have preferred to be on the smart side of average rather than thedumb side, but intelligence counted far less than, say, physicalappearance, charisma, or athletic ability.So if intelligence in itself is not a factor in popularity, why aresmart kids so consistently unpopular? The answer, I think, is thatthey don\\'t really want to be popular.If someone had told me that at the time, I would have laughed athim. Being unpopular in school makes kids miserable, some of themso miserable that they commit suicide. Telling me that I didn\\'twant to be popular would have seemed like telling someone dying ofthirst in a desert that he didn\\'t want a glass of water. Of courseI wanted to be popular.But in fact I didn\\'t, not enough. There was something else I wantedmore: to be smart. Not simply to do well in school, though thatcounted for something, but to design beautiful rockets, or to writewell, or to understand how to program computers. In general, tomake great things.At the time I never tried to separate my wants and weigh themagainst one another. If I had, I would have seen that being smartwas more important. If someone had offered me the chance to bethe most popular kid in school, but only at the price of being ofaverage intelligence (humor me here), I wouldn\\'t have taken it.Much as they suffer from their unpopularity, I don\\'t think manynerds would. To them the thought of average intelligence is unbearable.But most kids would take that deal. For half of them, it would bea step up. Even for someone in the eightieth percentile (assuming,as everyone seemed to then, that intelligence is a scalar), whowouldn\\'t drop thirty points in exchange for being loved and admiredby everyone?And that, I think, is the root of the problem. Nerds serve twomasters. They want to be popular, certainly, but they want evenmore to be smart. And popularity is not something you can do inyour spare time, not in the fiercely competitive environment of anAmerican secondary school.Alberti, arguably the archetype of the Renaissance Man, writes that\"no art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if youwant to excel in it.\"I wonder if anyone in the world works harderat anything than American school kids work at popularity. Navy SEALsand neurosurgery residents seem slackers by comparison. Theyoccasionally take vacations; some even have hobbies. An Americanteenager may work at being popular every waking hour, 365 days ayear.I don\\'t mean to suggest they do this consciously. Some of them trulyare little Machiavellis, but what I really mean here is that teenagersare always on duty as conformists.For example, teenage kids pay a great deal of attention to clothes.They don\\'t consciously dress to be popular. They dress to look good.But to who? To the other kids. Other kids\\' opinions become theirdefinition of right, not just for clothes, but for almost everythingthey do, right down to the way they walk. And so every effort theymake to do things \"right\" is also, consciously or not, an effortto be more popular.Nerds don\\'t realize this. They don\\'t realize that it takes work tobe popular. In general, people outside some very demanding fielddon\\'t realize the extent to which success depends on constant (thoughoften unconscious) effort. For example, most people seem to considerthe ability to draw as some kind of innate quality, like being tall.In fact, most people who \"can draw\" like drawing, and have spentmany hours doing it; that\\'s why they\\'re good at it. Likewise, popularisn\\'t just something you are or you aren\\'t, but something you makeyourself.The main reason nerds are unpopular is that they have other thingsto think about. Their attention is drawn to books or the naturalworld, not fashions and parties. They\\'re like someone trying toplay soccer while balancing a glass of water on his head. Otherplayers who can focus their whole attention on the game beat themeffortlessly, and wonder why they seem so incapable.Even if nerds cared as much as other kids about popularity, beingpopular would be more work for them. The popular kids learned tobe popular, and to want to be popular, the same way the nerds learnedto be smart, and to want to be smart: from their parents. While thenerds were being trained to get the right answers, the popular kidswere being trained to please.So far I\\'ve been finessing the relationship between smart and nerd,using them as if they were interchangeable. In fact it\\'s only thecontext that makes them so. A nerd is someone who isn\\'t sociallyadept enough. But \"enough\" depends on where you are. In a typicalAmerican school, standards for coolness are so high (or at least,so specific) that you don\\'t have to be especially awkward to lookawkward by comparison.Few smart kids can spare the attention that popularity requires.Unless they also happen to be good-looking, natural athletes, orsiblings of popular kids, they\\'ll tend to become nerds. And that\\'swhy smart people\\'s lives are worst between, say, the ages of elevenand seventeen. Life at that age revolves far more around popularitythan before or after.Before that, kids\\' lives are dominated by their parents, not byother kids. Kids do care what their peers think in elementary school,but this isn\\'t their whole life, as it later becomes.Around the age of eleven, though, kids seem to start treating theirfamily as a day job. They create a new world among themselves, andstanding in this world is what matters, not standing in their family.Indeed, being in trouble in their family can win them points in theworld they care about.The problem is, the world these kids create for themselves is atfirst a very crude one. If you leave a bunch of eleven-year-oldsto their own devices, what you get isLord of the Flies.Likea lot of American kids, I read this book in school. Presumably itwas not a coincidence. Presumably someone wanted to point out tous that we were savages, and that we had made ourselves a cruel andstupid world. This was too subtle for me. While the book seemedentirely believable, I didn\\'t get the additional message. I wishthey had just told us outright that we were savages and our worldwas stupid.Nerds would find their unpopularity more bearable if it merelycaused them to be ignored. Unfortunately, to be unpopular in schoolis to be actively persecuted.Why? Once again, anyone currently in school might think this astrange question to ask. How could things be any other way? Butthey could be. Adults don\\'t normally persecute nerds. Why do teenagekids do it?Partly because teenagers are still half children, and manychildren are just intrinsically cruel. Some torture nerds for thesame reason they pull the legs off spiders. Before you develop aconscience, torture is amusing.Another reason kids persecute nerds is to make themselves feelbetter. When you tread water, you lift yourself up by pushing waterdown. Likewise, in any social hierarchy, people unsure of their ownposition will try to emphasize it by maltreating those they thinkrank below. I\\'ve read that this is why poor whites in the UnitedStates are the group most hostile to blacks.But I think the main reason other kids persecute nerds is that it\\'spart of the mechanism of popularity. Popularity is only partiallyabout individual attractiveness. It\\'s much more about alliances.To become more popular, you need to be constantly doing things thatbring you close to other popular people, and nothing brings peoplecloser than a common enemy.Like a politician who wants to distract voters from bad times athome, you can create an enemy if there isn\\'t a real one. By singlingout and persecuting a nerd, a group of kids from higher in thehierarchy create bonds between themselves. Attacking an outsidermakes them all insiders. This is why the worst cases of bullyinghappen with groups. Ask any nerd: you get much worse treatment froma group of kids than from any individual bully, however sadistic.If it\\'s any consolation to the nerds, it\\'s nothing personal. Thegroup of kids who band together to pick on you are doing the samething, and for the same reason, as a bunch of guys who get togetherto go hunting. They don\\'t actually hate you. They just need somethingto chase.Because they\\'re at the bottom of the scale, nerds are a safe targetfor the entire school. If I remember correctly, the most popularkids don\\'t persecute nerds; they don\\'t need to stoop to such things.Most of the persecution comes from kids lower down, the nervousmiddle classes.The trouble is, there are a lot of them. The distribution ofpopularity is not a pyramid, but tapers at the bottom like a pear.The least popular group is quite small. (I believe we were the onlyD table in our cafeteria map.) So there are more people who wantto pick on nerds than there are nerds.As well as gaining points by distancing oneself from unpopular kids,one loses points by being close to them. A woman I know says thatin high school she liked nerds, but was afraid to be seen talkingto them because the other girls would make fun of her. Unpopularityis a communicable disease; kids too nice to pick on nerds will stillostracize them in self-defense.It\\'s no wonder, then, that smart kids tend to be unhappy in middleschool and high school. Their other interests leave them littleattention to spare for popularity, and since popularity resemblesa zero-sum game, this in turn makes them targets for the wholeschool. And the strange thing is, this nightmare scenario happenswithout any conscious malice, merely because of the shape of thesituation.For me the worst stretch was junior high, when kid culture was newand harsh, and the specialization that would later gradually separatethe smarter kids had barely begun. Nearly everyone I\\'ve talked toagrees: the nadir is somewhere between eleven and fourteen.In our school it was eighth grade, which was ages twelve and thirteenfor me. There was a brief sensation that year when one of ourteachers overheard a group of girls waiting for the school bus, andwas so shocked that the next day she devoted the whole class to aneloquent plea not to be so cruel to one another.It didn\\'t have any noticeable effect. What struck me at the timewas that she was surprised. You mean she doesn\\'t know the kind ofthings they say to one another? You mean this isn\\'t normal?It\\'s important to realize that, no, the adults don\\'t know what thekids are doing to one another. They know, in the abstract, thatkids are monstrously cruel to one another, just as we know in theabstract that people get tortured in poorer countries. But, likeus, they don\\'t like to dwell on this depressing fact, and they don\\'tsee evidence of specific abuses unless they go looking for it.Public school teachers are in much the same position as prisonwardens. Wardens\\' main concern is to keep the prisoners on thepremises. They also need to keep them fed, and as far as possibleprevent them from killing one another. Beyond that, they want tohave as little to do with the prisoners as possible, so they leavethem to create whatever social organization they want. From whatI\\'ve read, the society that the prisoners create is warped, savage,and pervasive, and it is no fun to be at the bottom of it.In outline, it was the same at the schools I went to. The mostimportant thing was to stay on the premises. While there, theauthorities fed you, prevented overt violence, and made some effortto teach you something. But beyond that they didn\\'t want to havetoo much to do with the kids. Like prison wardens, the teachersmostly left us to ourselves. And, like prisoners, the culture wecreated was barbaric.Why is the real world more hospitable to nerds? It might seem thatthe answer is simply that it\\'s populated by adults, who are toomature to pick on one another. But I don\\'t think this is true.Adults in prison certainly pick on one another. And so, apparently,do society wives; in some parts of Manhattan, life for women soundslike a continuation of high school, with all the same petty intrigues.I think the important thing about the real world is not that it\\'spopulated by adults, but that it\\'s very large, and the things youdo have real effects. That\\'s what school, prison, and ladies-who-lunchall lack. The inhabitants of all those worlds are trapped in littlebubbles where nothing they do can have more than a local effect.Naturally these societies degenerate into savagery. They have nofunction for their form to follow.When the things you do have real effects, it\\'s no longer enoughjust to be pleasing. It starts to be important to get the rightanswers, and that\\'s where nerds show to advantage. Bill Gates willof course come to mind. Though notoriously lacking in social skills,he gets the right answers, at least as measured in revenue.The other thing that\\'s different about the real world is that it\\'smuch larger. In a large enough pool, even the smallest minoritiescan achieve a critical mass if they clump together. Out in the realworld, nerds collect in certain places and form their own societieswhere intelligence is the most important thing. Sometimes the currenteven starts to flow in the other direction: sometimes, particularlyin university math and science departments, nerds deliberatelyexaggerate their awkwardness in order to seem smarter. John Nashso admired Norbert Wiener that he adopted his habit of touching thewall as he walked down a corridor.As a thirteen-year-old kid, I didn\\'t have much more experience ofthe world than what I saw immediately around me. The warped littleworld we lived in was, I thought,the world.The world seemed crueland boring, and I\\'m not sure which was worse.Because I didn\\'t fit into this world, I thought that something mustbe wrong with me. I didn\\'t realize that the reason we nerds didn\\'tfit in was that in some wayswe were a step ahead. We were already thinking aboutthe kind of things that matter in the real world, instead of spendingall our time playing an exacting but mostly pointless game like theothers.We were a bit like an adult would be if he were thrust back intomiddle school. He wouldn\\'t know the right clothes to wear, the rightmusic to like, the right slang to use. He\\'d seem to the kids acomplete alien. The thing is, he\\'d know enough not to care whatthey thought. We had no such confidence.A lot of people seem to think it\\'s good for smart kids to be throwntogether with \"normal\" kids at this stage of their lives. Perhaps.But in at least some cases the reason the nerds don\\'t fit in reallyis that everyone else is crazy. I remember sitting in the audienceat a \"pep rally\" at my high school, watching as the cheerleadersthrew an effigy of an opposing player into the audience to be tornto pieces. I felt like an explorer witnessing some bizarre tribalritual.If I could go back and give my thirteen year old self some advice,the main thing I\\'d tell him would be to stick his head up and lookaround. I didn\\'t really grasp it at the time, but the whole worldwe lived in was as fake as a Twinkie. Not just school, but theentire town. Why do people move to suburbia? To have kids! So nowonder it seemed boring and sterile. The whole place was a giantnursery, an artificial town created explicitly for the purpose ofbreeding children.Where I grew up, it felt as if there was nowhere to go, and nothingto do. This was no accident. Suburbs are deliberately designed toexclude the outside world, because it contains things that couldendanger children.And as for the schools, they were just holding pens within thisfake world. Officially the purpose of schools is to teach kids. Infact their primary purpose is to keep kids locked up in oneplace for a big chunk of the day so adults can get things done. AndI have no problem with this: in a specialized industrial society,it would be a disaster to have kids running around loose.What bothers me is not that the kids are kept in prisons, but that(a) they aren\\'t told about it, and (b) the prisons are run mostlyby the inmates. Kids are sent off to spend six years memorizingmeaningless facts in a world ruled by a caste of giants who runafter an oblong brown ball, as if this were the most natural thingin the world. And if they balk at this surreal cocktail, they\\'recalled misfits.Life in this twisted world is stressful for the kids. And not justfor the nerds. Like any war, it\\'s damaging even to the winners.Adults can\\'t avoid seeing that teenage kids are tormented. So whydon\\'t they do something about it? Because they blame it on puberty.The reason kids are so unhappy, adults tell themselves, is thatmonstrous new chemicals,hormones, are now coursing through theirbloodstream and messing up everything. There\\'s nothing wrong withthe system; it\\'s just inevitable that kids will be miserable atthat age.This idea is so pervasive that even the kids believe it, whichprobably doesn\\'t help. Someone who thinks his feet naturally hurtis not going to stop to consider the possibility that he is wearingthe wrong size shoes.I\\'m suspicious of this theory that thirteen-year-old kids areintrinsically messed up. If it\\'s physiological, it should beuniversal. Are Mongol nomads all nihilists at thirteen? I\\'ve reada lot of history, and I have not seen a single referenceto this supposedly universal fact before the twentieth century.Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance seem to have been cheerfuland eager. They got in fights and played tricks on one another ofcourse (Michelangelo had his nose broken by a bully), but theyweren\\'t crazy.As far as I can tell, the concept of the hormone-crazed teenageris coeval with suburbia. I don\\'t think this is a coincidence. Ithink teenagers are driven crazy by the life they\\'re made to lead.Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance were working dogs. Teenagersnow are neurotic lapdogs. Their craziness is the craziness of theidle everywhere.When I was in school, suicide was a constant topic among the smarterkids. No one I knew did it, but several planned to, andsome may have tried. Mostly this was just a pose. Like otherteenagers, we loved the dramatic, and suicide seemed very dramatic.But partly it was because our lives were at times genuinely miserable.Bullying was only part of the problem. Another problem, and possiblyan even worse one, was that we never had anything real to work on.Humans like to work; in most of the world, your work is your identity.And all the work we did waspointless, or seemed so at the time.At best it was practice for real work we might do far in the future,so far that we didn\\'t even know at the time what we were practicingfor. More often it was just an arbitrary series of hoops to jumpthrough, words without content designed mainly for testability.(The three main causes of the Civil War were....Test: List the three main causes of the Civil War.)And there was no way to opt out. The adults had agreed amongthemselves that this was to be the route to college. The only wayto escape this empty life was to submit to it.Teenage kids used to have a more active role in society. Inpre-industrial times, they were all apprentices of one sort oranother, whether in shops or on farms or even on warships. Theyweren\\'t left to create their own societies. They were junior membersof adult societies.Teenagers seem to have respected adults more then, becausethe adults were the visible experts in the skills they were tryingto learn. Now most kids have little idea what their parents do intheir distant offices, and see no connection (indeed, there isprecious little) between schoolwork and the work they\\'ll do asadults.And if teenagers respected adults more, adults also had more usefor teenagers. After a couple years\\' training, an apprentice couldbe a real help. Even the newest apprentice could be made to carrymessages or sweep the workshop.Now adults have no immediate use for teenagers. They would be inthe way in an office. So they drop them off at school on their wayto work, much as they might drop the dog off at a kennel if they  were going away for the weekend.What happened? We\\'re up against a hard one here. The cause of thisproblem is the same as the cause of so many present ills: specialization.As jobs become more specialized, we have to train longer for them.Kids in pre-industrial times started working at about 14 atthe latest; kids on farms, where most people lived, began far  earlier. Now kids who go to college don\\'t start working full-time till 21 or 22. With some degrees, like MDs and PhDs, you may notfinish your training till 30.Teenagers now are useless, except as cheap labor in industries likefast food, which evolved to exploit precisely this fact. In almostany other kind of work, they\\'d be a net loss. But they\\'re also too young to be left unsupervised. Someone has to watch over them, andthe most efficient way to do this is to collect them together inone place. Then a few adults can watch all of them.If you stop there, what you\\'re describing is literally a prison,albeit a part-time one. The problem is, many schools practicallydo stop there. The stated purpose of schools is to educate the kids.But there is no external pressure to do this well. And so mostschools do such a bad job of teaching that the kids don\\'t reallytake it seriously-- not even the smart kids. Much of the time wewere all, students and teachers both, just going through the motions.In my high school French class we were supposed to read Hugo\\'sLesMiserables.I don\\'t think any of us knew French well enough to makeour way through this enormous book.

I wouldn\\'t know about itnow except that a few months ago, while visiting Yahoo, I happenedto run into a Big Cheese I knew from working there in the latenineties.  He brought up something called Revenue Loop, which Viawebhad been working on when they bought us.The idea is basically that you sort search results not in order oftextual \"relevance\" (as search engines did then) nor in order ofhow much advertisers bid (as Overture did) but in order of the bidtimes the number of transactions.  Ordinarily you\\'d do this forshopping searches, though in fact one of the features of our schemeis that it automatically detects which searches are shopping searches.If you just order the results in order of bids, you can make thesearch results useless, because the first results could be dominatedby lame sites that had bid the most.  But if you order results bybid multiplied by transactions, far from selling out, you\\'re gettingabettermeasure of relevance.  What could be a better sign thatsomeone was satisfied with a search result than going to the siteand buying something?And, of course, this algorithm automatically maximizes the revenueof the search engine.Everyone is focused on this type of approach now, but few were in1998.  In 1998 it was all about selling banner ads.  We didn\\'t knowthat, so we were pretty excited when we figured out what seemed tous the optimal way of doing shopping searches.When Yahoo was thinking of buying us, we had a meeting with JerryYang in New York.  For him, I now realize, this was supposed to beone of those meetings when you check out a company you\\'ve prettymuch decided to buy, just to make sure they\\'re ok guys.  We weren\\'texpected to do more than chat and seem smart and reasonable.  Hemust have been dismayed when I jumped up to the whiteboard andlaunched into a presentation of our exciting new technology.I was just as dismayed when he didn\\'t seem to care at all about it.At the time I thought, \"boy, is this guy poker-faced.  We presentto him what has to be the optimal way of sorting product searchresults, and he\\'s not even curious.\"  I didn\\'t realize till much laterwhy he didn\\'t care.  In 1998, advertisers were overpaying enormouslyfor ads on web sites.  In 1998, if advertisers paid the maximum that traffic was worth tothem, Yahoo\\'s revenues would havedecreased.Things are different now, of course.  Now this sort of thing is allthe rage.  So when I ran into the Yahoo exec I knew from the olddays in the Yahoo cafeteria a few months ago, the first thing heremembered was not (fortunately) all the fights I had with him, butRevenue Loop.\"Well,\" I said, \"I think we actually applied for a patent on it.I\\'m not sure what happened to the application after I left.\"\"Really?  That would be an important patent.\"So someone investigated, and sure enough, that patent applicationhad continued in the pipeline for several years after, and finallyissued in 2003.The main thing that struck me on reading it, actually, is thatlawyers at some point messed up my nice clear writing.  Some cleverperson with a spell checker reduced one section to Zen-like incomprehensibility:Also, common spelling errors will tend to get fixed. For example,  if users searching for \"compact disc player\" end up spending  considerable money at sites offering compact disc players, then  those pages will have a higher relevance for that search phrase,  even though the phrase \"compact disc player\" is not present on  those pages.(That \"compat disc player\" wasn\\'t a typo, guys.)For the fine prose of the original, see the provisional applicationof February 1998, back when we were still Viaweb and couldn\\'t affordto pay lawyers to turn every \"a lot of\" into \"considerable.\"'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.August 2006, rev. April 2007, September 2010In a few days it will be Demo Day, when the startups we fundedthis summer present to investors.  Y Combinator funds startups twicea year, in January and June.  Ten weeks later we invite all theinvestors we know to hear them present what they\\'ve built so far.Ten weeks is not much time.  The average startup probably doesn\\'thave much to show for itself after ten weeks.  But the averagestartup fails.  When you look at the ones that went on to do greatthings, you find a lot that began with someone pounding out aprototype in a week or two of nonstop work.  Startups are acounterexample to the rule that haste makes waste.(Too much money seems to be as bad for startups as too much time,so we don\\'t give them much money either.)A week before Demo Day, we have a dress rehearsal called Rehearsal Day.At other Y Combinator events we allow outside guests, but not atRehearsal Day.  No one except the other founders gets to see the rehearsals.The presentations on Rehearsal Day are often pretty rough.  But this isto be expected.  We try to pick founders who are good at buildingthings, not ones who are slick presenters.  Some of the foundersare just out of college, or even still in it, and have never spokento a group of people they didn\\'t already know.So we concentrate on the basics.  On Demo Day each startup willonly get ten minutes, so we encourage them to focus on just twogoals: (a) explain what you\\'re doing, and (b) explain why userswill want it.That might sound easy, but it\\'s not when the speakers have noexperience presenting, and they\\'re explaining technical matters toan audience that\\'s mostly non-technical.This situation is constantly repeated when startups present toinvestors: people who are bad at explaining, talking to people whoare bad at understanding.  Practically every successful startup,including stars like Google, presented at some point to investorswho didn\\'t get it and turned them down.  Was it because the founderswere bad at presenting, or because the investors were obtuse?  It\\'sprobably always some of both.At the most recent Rehearsal Day, we four Y Combinator partners foundourselves saying a lot of the same things we said at the last two.So at dinner afterward we collected all our tips about presentingto investors.  Most startups face similar challenges, so we hopethese will be useful to a wider audience.1. Explain what you\\'re doing.Investors\\' main question when judging a very early startup is whetheryou\\'ve made a compelling product.  Before they can judge whetheryou\\'ve built a good x, they have to understand what kind of x you\\'vebuilt.  They will get very frustrated if instead of telling themwhat you do, you make them sit through some kind of preamble.Say what you\\'re doing as soon as possible, preferably in the firstsentence. \"We\\'re Jeff and Bob and we\\'ve built an easy to use web-baseddatabase.  Now we\\'ll show it to you and explain why people needthis.\"If you\\'re a great public speaker you may be able to violate thisrule.  Last year one founder spent the whole first half of his talkon a fascinating analysis of the limits of the conventional desktopmetaphor.  He got away with it, but unless you\\'re a captivatingspeaker, which most hackers aren\\'t, it\\'s better to play it safe.2. Get rapidly to demo.This section is now obsolete for YC founders presentingat Demo Day, because Demo Day presentations are now so shortthat they rarely include much if any demo.  They seem to workjust as well without, however, which makes me think I waswrong to emphasize demos so much before.A demo explains what you\\'ve made more effectively than any verbaldescription.  The only thing worth talking about first is the problemyou\\'re trying to solve and why it\\'s important.  But don\\'t spendmore than a tenth of your time on that.  Then demo.When you demo, don\\'t run through a catalog of features.  Insteadstart with the problem you\\'re solving, and then show how your productsolves it.  Show features in an order driven by some kind of purpose,rather than the order in which they happen to appear on the screen.If you\\'re demoing something web-based, assume that the networkconnection will mysteriously die 30 seconds into your presentation,and come prepared with a copy of the server software running onyour laptop.3. Better a narrow description than a vague one.One reason founders resist describing their projects concisely isthat, at this early stage, there are all kinds of possibilities.The most concise descriptions seem misleadingly narrow.  So forexample a group that has built an easy web-based database mightresist calling their applicaton that, because it could be so muchmore.  In fact, it could be anything...The problem is, as you approach (in the calculus sense) a descriptionof something that could be anything, the content of your descriptionapproaches zero.  If you describe your web-based database as \"asystem to allow people to collaboratively leverage the value ofinformation,\" it will go in one investor ear and out the other.They\\'ll just discard that sentence as meaningless boilerplate, andhope, with increasing impatience, that in the next sentence you\\'llactually explain what you\\'ve made.Your primary goal is not to describe everything your system mightone day become, but simply to convince investors you\\'re worth talkingto further.  So approach this like an algorithm that gets the rightanswer by successive approximations.  Begin with a descriptionthat\\'s gripping but perhaps overly narrow, then flesh it out to theextent you can.  It\\'s the same principle as incremental development:start with a simple prototype, then add features, but at every pointhave working code.  In this case, \"working code\" means a workingdescription in the investor\\'s head.4. Don\\'t talk and drive.Have one person talk while another uses the computer.  If the sameperson does both, they\\'ll inevitably mumble downwards at the computerscreen instead of talking clearly at the audience.As long as you\\'re standing near the audience and looking at them,politeness (and habit) compel them to pay attention to you.  Onceyou stop looking at them to fuss with something on your computer,their minds drift off to the errands they have to run later.5. Don\\'t talk about secondary matters at length.If you only have a few minutes, spend them explaining what yourproduct does and why it\\'s great.  Second order issues like competitorsor resumes should be single slides you go through quickly at theend.  If you have impressive resumes, just flash them on the screenfor 15 seconds and say a few words.  For competitors, list the top3 and explain in one sentence each what they lackthat you have.  And put this kind of thing at the end, after you\\'vemade it clear what you\\'ve built.6. Don\\'t get too deeply into business models.It\\'s good to talk about how you plan to make money, but mainlybecause it shows you care about that and have thought about it.Don\\'t go into detail about your business model, because (a) that\\'snot what smart investors care about in a brief presentation, and(b) any business model you have at this point is probably wronganyway.Recently a VC who came to speak at Y Combinator talked about acompany he just invested in.  He said their business model was wrongand would probably change three times before they got it right.The founders were experienced guys who\\'d done startups before andwho\\'d just succeeded in getting millions from one of the top VCfirms, and even their business model was crap.  (And yet he investedanyway, because he expected it to be crap at this stage.)If you\\'re solving an important problem, you\\'re going to sound a lotsmarter talking about that than the business model.  The businessmodel is just a bunch of guesses, and guesses about stuff that\\'sprobably not your area of expertise.  So don\\'t spend your preciousfew minutes talking about crap when you could be talking aboutsolid, interesting things you know a lot about: the problem you\\'resolving and what you\\'ve built so far.As well as being a bad use of time, if your business model seemsspectacularly wrong, that will push the stuff you want investorsto remember out of their heads.  They\\'ll just remember you as thecompany with the boneheaded plan for making money, rather than thecompany that solved that important problem.7. Talk slowly and clearly at the audience.Everyone at Rehearsal Day could see the difference between the peoplewho\\'d been out in the world for a while and had presented to groups,and those who hadn\\'t.You need to use a completely different voice and manner talking toa roomful of people than you would in conversation.  Everyday lifegives you no practice in this.  If you can\\'t already do it, thebest solution is to treat it as a consciously artificial trick,like juggling.However, that doesn\\'t mean you should talk like some kind ofannouncer.  Audiences tune that out.  What you need to do is talkin this artificial way, and yet make it seem conversational.  (Writingis the same.  Good writing is an elaborate effort to seem spontaneous.)If you want to write out your whole presentation beforehand andmemorize it, that\\'s ok.  That has worked for some groups in thepast.  But make sure to write something that sounds like spontaneous,informal speech, and deliver it that way too.Err on the side of speaking slowly.  At Rehearsal Day, one of the foundersmentioned a rule actors use: if you feel you\\'re speaking too slowly,you\\'re speaking at about the right speed.8. Have one person talk.Startups often want to show that all the founders are equal partners.This is a good instinct; investors dislike unbalanced teams.  Buttrying to show it by partitioning the presentation is going toofar.  It\\'s distracting.  You can demonstrate your respectfor one another in more subtle ways.  For example, when one of thegroups presented at Demo Day, the more extroverted of the twofounders did most of the talking, but he described his co-founderas the best hacker he\\'d ever met, and you could tell he meant it.Pick the one or at most two best speakers, and have them do mostof the talking.Exception: If one of the founders is an expert in some specifictechnical field, it can be good for them to talk about that for aminute or so.  This kind of \"expert witness\" can add credibility,even if the audience doesn\\'t understand all the details.  If Jobsand Wozniak had 10 minutes to present the Apple II, it might be a good planto have Jobs speak for 9 minutes and have Woz speak for a minutein the middle about some of the technical feats he\\'d pulled off inthe design.  (Though of course if it were actually those two, Jobswould speak for the entire 10 minutes.)9. Seem confident.Between the brief time available and their lack of technicalbackground, many in the audience will have a hard time evaluatingwhat you\\'re doing.  Probably the single biggest piece of evidence,initially, will be your own confidence in it.   You haveto show you\\'re impressed with what you\\'ve made.And I mean show, not tell.  Never say \"we\\'re passionate\" or \"ourproduct is great.\"  People just ignore that—or worse, write youoff as bullshitters.  Such messages must be implicit.What you must not do is seem nervous and apologetic.  If you\\'vetruly made something good, you\\'re doing investors afavorbytelling them about it.  If you don\\'t genuinely believe that, perhapsyou ought to change what your company is doing.  If you don\\'t believeyour startup has such promise that you\\'d be doing them a favor byletting them invest, why are you investing your time in it?10. Don\\'t try to seem more than you are.Don\\'t worry if your company is just a few months old and doesn\\'thave an office yet, or your founders are technical people with nobusiness experience.  Google was like that once, and they turned outok.  Smart investors can see past such superficial flaws.  They\\'renot looking for finished, smooth presentations.  They\\'re lookingfor raw talent.  All you need to convince them of is that you\\'resmart and that you\\'re onto something good.  If you try too hard toconceal your rawness—by trying to seem corporate, or pretendingto know about stuff you don\\'t—you may just conceal your talent.You can afford to be candid about what you haven\\'t figured out yet.Don\\'t go out of your way to bring it up (e.g. by having a slideabout what might go wrong), but don\\'t try to pretend either thatyou\\'re further along than you are.  If you\\'re a hacker and you\\'representing to experienced investors, they\\'re probably better atdetecting bullshit than you are at producing it.11. Don\\'t put too many words on slides.When there are a lot of words on a slide, people just skip readingit.  So look at your slides and ask of each word \"could I crossthis out?\"  This includes gratuitous clip art.  Try to get yourslides under 20 words if you can.Don\\'t read your slides.  They should be something in the backgroundas you face the audience and talk to them, not something you faceand read to an audience sitting behind you.Cluttered sites don\\'t do well in demos, especially when they\\'reprojected onto a screen.  At the very least, crank up the font sizebig enough to make all the text legible.  But cluttered sites arebad anyway, so perhaps you should use this opportunity to make yourdesign simpler.12. Specific numbers are good.If you have any kind of data, however preliminary, tell the audience.Numbers stick in people\\'s heads.  If you can claim that the medianvisitor generates 12 page views, that\\'s great.But don\\'t give them more than four or five numbers, and only givethem numbers specific to you.  You don\\'t need to tell them the sizeof the market you\\'re in.  Who cares, really, if it\\'s 500 millionor 5 billion a year?  Talking about that is like an actor at thebeginning of his career telling his parents how much Tom Hanksmakes.  Yeah, sure, but first you have to become Tom Hanks.  Theimportant part is not whether he makes ten million a year or ahundred, but how you get there.13. Tell stories about users.The biggest fear of investors looking at early stage startups isthat you\\'ve built something based on your own a priori theories ofwhat the world needs, but that no one will actually want.  So it\\'sgood if you can talk about problems specific users have and how yousolve them.Greg Mcadoo said one thing Sequoia looks for is the \"proxy fordemand.\"  What are people doing now, using inadequate tools, thatshows they need what you\\'re making?Another sign of user need is when people pay a lot for something.It\\'s easy to convince investors there will be demand fora cheaper alternative to something popular, if you preservethe qualities that made it popular.The best stories about user needs are about your own.  A remarkablenumber of famous startups grew out of some need the founders had:Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, Google.  Experienced investors know that,so stories of this type will get their attention.  The next bestthing is to talk about the needs of people you know personally,like your friends or siblings.14. Make a soundbite stick in their heads.Professional investors hear a lot of pitches.  After a while theyall blur together.  The first cut is simply to be one of thosethey remember.  And the way to ensure that is to create a descriptivephrase about yourself that sticks in their heads.In Hollywood, these phrases seem to be of the form \"x meets y.\"In the startup world, they\\'re usually \"the x of y\" or \"the x y.\"Viaweb\\'s was \"the Microsoft Word of ecommerce.\"Find one and launch it clearly (but apparently casually) in yourtalk, preferably near the beginning.It\\'s a good exercise for you, too, to sit down and try to figureout how to describe your startup in one compelling phrase.  If youcan\\'t, your plans may not be sufficiently focused.How to Fund a StartupHackers\\' Guide to InvestorsSpanish TranslationJapanese TranslationRussian TranslationImage: Casey Muller: Trevor Blackwell at Rehearsal Day, summer 2006'},\n",

       "  'date': 'May 2008',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'Adults lie constantly to kids.  I\\'m not saying we should stop, butI think we should at least examine which lies we tell and why.There may also be a benefit to us.  We were all lied to as kids,and some of the lies we were told still affect us.  So by studyingthe ways adults lie to kids, we may be able to clear our heads oflies we were told.I\\'m using the word \"lie\" in a very general sense: not just overtfalsehoods, but also all the more subtle ways we mislead kids.Though \"lie\" has negative connotations, I don\\'t mean to suggest weshould never do this—just that we should pay attention whenwe do.One of the most remarkable things about the way we lie to kids ishow broad the conspiracy is.  All adults know what their culture lies to kids about: they\\'re the questions you answer \"Askyour parents.\"  If a kid asked who won the World Series in 1982or what the atomic weight of carbon was, you could just tell him.But if a kid asks you \"Is there a God?\" or \"What\\'s a prostitute?\"you\\'ll probably say \"Ask your parents.\"Since we all agree, kids see few cracks in the view of the worldpresented to them.  The biggest disagreements are between parentsand schools, but even those are small. Schools are careful whatthey say about controversial topics, and if they do contradict whatparents want their kids to believe, parents either pressure theschool into keepingquietor move their kids to a new school.The conspiracy is so thorough that most kids who discover it do soonly by discovering internal contradictions in what they\\'re told.It can be traumatic for the ones who wake up during the operation.Here\\'s what happened to Einstein:Through the reading of popular scientific books I soon reached  the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not  be true.  The consequence was a positively fanatic freethinking  coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being  deceived by the state through lies: it was a crushing impression.I remember that feeling.  By 15 I was convinced the world was corruptfrom end to end.  That\\'s why movies likeThe Matrixhave suchresonance.  Every kid grows up in a fake world.  In a way it wouldbe easier if the forces behind it were as clearly differentiatedas a bunch of evil machines, and one could make a clean break just bytaking a pill.ProtectionIf you ask adults why they lie to kids, the most common reason theygive is to protect them.  And kids do need protecting.  The environmentyou want to create for a newborn child will be quite unlike thestreets of a big city.That seems so obvious it seems wrong to call it a lie.  It\\'s certainlynot a bad lie to tell, to give a baby the impression the world isquiet and warm and safe.  But this harmless type of lie can turnsour if left unexamined.Imagine if you tried to keep someone in as protected an environmentas a newborn till age 18.  To mislead someone so grossly about theworld would seem not protection but abuse.  That\\'s an extremeexample, of course; when parents do that sort of thing it becomesnational news.  But you see the same problem on a smaller scale inthe malaise teenagers feel in suburbia.The main purpose of suburbia is to provide a protected environmentfor children to grow up in.  And it seems great for 10 year olds.I liked living in suburbia when I was 10.  I didn\\'t notice howsterile it was.  My whole world was no bigger than a few friends\\'houses I bicycled to and some woods I ran around in.  On a log scaleI was midway between crib and globe.  A suburban street was justthe right size.  But as I grew older, suburbia started to feelsuffocatingly fake.Life can be pretty good at 10 or 20, but it\\'s often frustrating at15.  This is too big a problem to solve here, but certainly onereason life sucks at 15 is that kids are trapped in a world designedfor 10 year olds.What do parents hope to protect their children from by raising themin suburbia?  A friend who moved out of Manhattan said merely thather 3 year old daughter \"saw too much.\"  Off the top of my head,that might include: people who are high or drunk, poverty, madness,gruesome medical conditions, sexual behavior of various degrees ofoddness, and violent anger.I think it\\'s the anger that would worry me most if I had a 3 yearold.  I was 29 when I moved to New York and I was surprised eventhen.  I wouldn\\'t want a 3 year old to see some of the disputes Isaw.  It would be too frightening.  A lot of the things adultsconceal from smaller children, they conceal because they\\'d befrightening, not because they want to conceal the existence of suchthings.  Misleading the child is just a byproduct.This seems one of the most justifiable types of lying adults do tokids.  But because the lies are indirect we don\\'t keep a very strictaccounting of them.  Parents know they\\'ve concealed the facts aboutsex, and many at some point sit their kids down and explain more.But few tell their kids about the differences between the real worldand the cocoon they grew up in.  Combine this with the confidenceparents try to instill in their kids, and every year you get a newcrop of 18 year olds who think they know how to run the world.Don\\'t all 18 year olds think they know how to run the world?  Actuallythis seems to be a recent innovation, no more than about 100 years old.In preindustrial times teenage kids were junior members of the adultworld and comparatively well aware of their shortcomings.  Theycould see they weren\\'t as strong or skillful as the village smith.In past times people lied to kids about some things more than wedo now, but the lies implicit in an artificial, protected environmentare a recent invention.  Like a lot of new inventions, the rich gotthis first.  Children of kings and great magnates were the firstto grow up out of touch with the world.  Suburbia means half thepopulation can live like kings in that respect.Sex (and Drugs)I\\'d have different worries about raising teenage kids in New York.I\\'d worry less about what they\\'d see, and more about what they\\'ddo.  I went to college with a lot of kids who grew up in Manhattan,and as a rule they seemed pretty jaded.  They seemed to have losttheir virginity at an average of about 14 and by college had triedmore drugs than I\\'d even heard of.The reasons parents don\\'t want their teenage kids having sex arecomplex.  There are some obvious dangers: pregnancy and sexuallytransmitted diseases.  But those aren\\'t the only reasons parentsdon\\'t want their kids having sex.  The average parents of a 14 yearold girl would hate the idea of her having sex even if there werezero risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases.Kids can probably sense they aren\\'t being told the whole story.After all, pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases are just asmuch a problem for adults, and they have sex.What really bothers parents about their teenage kids having sex?Their dislike of the idea is so visceral it\\'s probably inborn.  Butif it\\'s inborn it should be universal, and there are plenty ofsocieties where parents don\\'t mind if their teenage kids havesex—indeed, where it\\'s normal for 14 year olds to becomemothers.  So what\\'s going on?  There does seem to be a universaltaboo against sex with prepubescent children.  One can imagineevolutionary reasons for that.  And I think this is the main reasonparents in industrialized societies dislike teenage kids havingsex.  They still think of them as children, even though biologicallythey\\'re not, so the taboo against child sex still has force.One thing adults conceal about sex they also conceal about drugs:that it can cause great pleasure.  That\\'s what makes sex and drugsso dangerous. The desire for them can cloud one\\'s judgement—whichis especially frightening when the judgement being clouded is thealready wretched judgement of a teenage kid.Here parents\\' desires conflict.  Older societies told kids they hadbad judgement, but modern parents want their children to be confident.This may well be a better plan than the old one of putting them intheir place, but it has the side effect that after having implicitlylied to kids about how good their judgement is, we then have to lieagain about all the things they might get into trouble with if theybelieved us.If parents told their kids the truth about sex and drugs, it wouldbe: the reason you should avoid these things is that you have lousyjudgement.  People with twice your experience still get burned bythem.  But this may be one of those cases where the truth wouldn\\'tbe convincing, because one of the symptoms of bad judgement isbelieving you have good judgement.  When you\\'re too weak to liftsomething, you can tell, but when you\\'re making a decision impetuously,you\\'re all the more sure of it.InnocenceAnother reason parents don\\'t want their kids having sex is thatthey want to keep them innocent.  Adults have a certain model ofhow kids are supposed to behave, and it\\'s different from what theyexpect of other adults.One of the most obvious differences is the words kids are allowedto use.  Most parents use words when talking to other adults thatthey wouldn\\'t want their kids using.  They try to hide even theexistence of these words for as long as they can.  And this isanother of those conspiracies everyone participates in: everyoneknows you\\'re not supposed to swear in front of kids.I\\'ve never heard more different explanations for anything parentstell kids than why they shouldn\\'t swear.  Every parent I know forbidstheir children to swear, and yet no two of them have the samejustification.  It\\'s clear most start with not wanting kids toswear, then make up the reason afterward.So my theory about what\\'s going on is that thefunctionofswearwords is to mark the speaker as an adult.  There\\'s no differencein the meaning of \"shit\" and \"poopoo.\"  So why should one be ok forkids to say and one forbidden?  The only explanation is: by definition.Why does it bother adults so much when kids do things reserved foradults?   The idea of a foul-mouthed, cynical 10 year old leaningagainst a lamppost with a cigarette hanging out of the corner ofhis mouth is very disconcerting.  But why?One reason we want kids to be innocent is that we\\'re programmed tolike certain kinds of helplessness.  I\\'ve several times heard motherssay they deliberately refrained from correcting their young children\\'smispronunciations because they were so cute.  And if you think aboutit, cuteness is helplessness. Toys and cartoon characters meant tobe cute always have clueless expressions and stubby, ineffectuallimbs.It\\'s not surprising we\\'d have an inborn desire to love and protecthelpless creatures, considering human offspring are so helpless forso long.  Without the helplessness that makes kids cute, they\\'d bevery annoying.  They\\'d merely seem like incompetent adults.  Butthere\\'s more to it than that.  The reason our hypothetical jaded10 year old bothers me so much is not just that he\\'d be annoying,but that he\\'d have cut off his prospects for growth so early.  Tobe jaded you have to think you know how the world works, and anytheory a 10 year old had about that would probably be a prettynarrow one.Innocence is also open-mindedness.  We want kids to be innocent sothey can continue to learn.  Paradoxical as it sounds, there aresome kinds of knowledge that get in the way of other kinds ofknowledge.  If you\\'re going to learn that the world is a brutalplace full of people trying to take advantage of one another, you\\'rebetter off learning it last.  Otherwise you won\\'t bother learningmuch more.Very smart adults often seem unusually innocent, and I don\\'t thinkthis is a coincidence.  I think they\\'ve deliberately avoided learningabout certain things.  Certainly I do.  I used to think I wantedto know everything.  Now I know I don\\'t.DeathAfter sex, death is the topic adults lie most conspicuously aboutto kids.  Sex I believe they conceal because of deep taboos.  Butwhy do we conceal death from kids?   Probably because small childrenare particularly horrified by it.  They want to feel safe, and deathis the ultimate threat.One of the most spectacular lies our parents told us was about thedeath of our first cat.  Over the years, as we asked for moredetails, they were compelled to invent more, so the story grew quiteelaborate.  The cat had died at the vet\\'s office.  Of what?  Of theanaesthesia itself.  Why was the cat at the vet\\'s office?  To befixed.  And why had such a routine operation killed it?  It wasn\\'tthe vet\\'s fault; the cat had a congenitally weak heart; the anaesthesiawas too much for it; but there was no way anyone could haveknown this in advance.  It was not till we were in our twentiesthat the truth came out: my sister, then about three, had accidentallystepped on the cat and broken its back.They didn\\'t feel the need to tell us the cat was now happily in catheaven.  My parents never claimed that people or animals who diedhad \"gone to a better place,\" or that we\\'d meet them again.  Itdidn\\'t seem to harm us.My grandmother told us an edited version of the death of mygrandfather.  She said they\\'d been sitting reading one day, andwhen she said something to him, he didn\\'t answer.  He seemed to beasleep, but when she tried to rouse him, she couldn\\'t.  \"He wasgone.\" Having a heart attack sounded like falling asleep.  Later Ilearned it hadn\\'t been so neat, and the heart attack had taken mostof a day to kill him.Along with such outright lies, there must have been a lot of changingthe subject when death came up.  I can\\'t remember that, of course,but I can infer it from the fact that I didn\\'t really grasp I wasgoing to die till I was about 19.  How could I have missed somethingso obvious for so long?  Now that I\\'ve seen parents managing thesubject, I can see how: questions about death are gently but firmlyturned aside.On this topic, especially, they\\'re met half-way by kids.  Kids oftenwant to be lied to.  They want to believe they\\'re living in acomfortable, safe world as much as their parents want them to believeit.IdentitySome parents feel a strong adherence to an ethnic or religious groupand want their kids to feel it too.  This usually requires twodifferent kinds of lying: the first is to tell the child that heor she is an X, and the second is whatever specific lies Xesdifferentiate themselves by believing.Telling a child they have a particular ethnic or religious identityis one of the stickiest things you can tell them.  Almost anythingelse you tell a kid, they can change their mind about later whenthey start to think for themselves.  But if you tell a kid they\\'rea member of a certain group, that seems nearly impossible to shake.This despite the fact that it can be one of the most premeditatedlies parents tell.  When parents are of different religions, they\\'lloften agree between themselves that their children will be \"raisedas Xes.\"  And it works. The kids obligingly grow up consideringthemselves as Xes, despite the fact that if their parents had chosenthe other way, they\\'d have grown up considering themselves as Ys.One reason this works so well is the second kind of lie involved.The truth is common property.  You can\\'t distinguish your group bydoing things that are rational, and believing things that are true.If you want to set yourself apart from other people, you have todo things that are arbitrary, and believe things that are false.And after having spent their whole lives doing things that are arbitraryand believing things that are false, and being regarded as odd by\"outsiders\" on that account, the cognitive dissonance pushingchildren to regard themselves as Xes must be enormous.  If theyaren\\'t an X, why are they attached to all these arbitrary beliefsand customs?  If they aren\\'t an X, why do all the non-Xes call themone?This form of lie is not without its uses.  You can use it to carrya payload of beneficial beliefs, and they will also become part ofthe child\\'s identity.  You can tell the child that in addition tonever wearing the color yellow, believing the world was created bya giant rabbit, and always snapping their fingers before eatingfish, Xes are also particularly honest and industrious.  Then Xchildren will grow up feeling it\\'s part of their identity to behonest and industrious.This probably accounts for a lot of the spread of modern religions,and explains why their doctrines are a combination of the usefuland the bizarre.  The bizarre half is what makes the religion stick,and the useful half is the payload.AuthorityOne of the least excusable reasons adults lie to kids is to maintainpower over them.  Sometimes these lies are truly sinister, like achild molester telling his victims they\\'ll get in trouble if theytell anyone what happened to them.  Others seem more innocent; itdepends how badly adults lie to maintain their power, and what theyuse it for.Most adults make some effort to conceal their flaws from children.Usually their motives are mixed.  For example, a father who has anaffair generally conceals it from his children.  His motive ispartly that it would worry them, partly that this would introducethe topic of sex, and partly (a larger part than he would admit)that he doesn\\'t want to tarnish himself in their eyes.If you want to learn what lies are told to kids, read almost anybook written to teach them about \"issues.\"Peter Mayle wroteone calledWhy Are We Getting a Divorce?It begins with the threemost important things to remember about divorce, one of which is:You shouldn\\'t put the blame on one parent, because divorce is  never only one person\\'s fault.Really?  When a man runs off with his secretary, is it always partlyhis wife\\'s fault?  But I can see why Mayle might have said this.Maybe it\\'s more important for kids to respect their parents thanto know the truth about them.But because adults conceal their flaws, and at the same time insiston high standards of behavior for kids, a lot of kids grow up feelingthey fall hopelessly short.  They walk around feeling horribly evilfor having used a swearword, while in fact most of the adults aroundthem are doing much worse things.This happens in intellectual as well as moral questions.  The moreconfident people are, the more willing they seem to be to answer aquestion \"I don\\'t know.\"  Less confident people feel they have tohave an answer or they\\'ll look bad.  My parents were pretty goodabout admitting when they didn\\'t know things, but I must have beentold a lot of lies of this type by teachers, because I rarely hearda teacher say \"I don\\'t know\" till I got to college.  I rememberbecause it was so surprising to hear someone say that in front ofa class.The first hint I had that teachers weren\\'t omniscient came in sixthgrade, after my father contradicted something I\\'d learned in school.When I protested that the teacher had said the opposite, my fatherreplied that the guy had no idea what he was talking about—thathe was just an elementary school teacher, after all.Justa teacher?  The phrase seemed almost grammatically ill-formed.Didn\\'t teachers know everything about the subjects they taught?And if not, why were they the ones teaching us?The sad fact is, US public school teachers don\\'t generally understandthe stuff they\\'re teaching very well.  There are some sterlingexceptions, but as a rule people planning to go into teaching rankacademically near the bottom of the college population.  So thefact that I still thought at age 11 that teachers were infallibleshows what a job the system must have done on my brain.SchoolWhat kids get taught in school is a complex mix of lies.  The mostexcusable are those told to simplify ideas to make them easy tolearn.  The problem is, a lot of propaganda gets slipped into thecurriculum in the name of simplification.Public school textbooks represent a compromise between what variouspowerful groups want kids to be told.  The lies are rarely overt.Usually they consist either of omissions or of over-emphasizingcertain topics at the expense of others.  The view of history wegot in elementary school was a crude hagiography, with at least onerepresentative of each powerful group.The famous scientists I remember were Einstein, Marie Curie, andGeorge Washington Carver.   Einstein was a big deal because hiswork led to the atom bomb.  Marie Curie was involved with X-rays.But I was mystified about Carver.  He seemed to have done stuffwith peanuts.It\\'s obvious now that he was on the list because he was black (andfor that matter that Marie Curie was on it because she was a woman),but as a kid I was confused for years about him.  I wonder if itwouldn\\'t have been better just to tell us the truth: that thereweren\\'t any famous black scientists.  Ranking George WashingtonCarver with Einstein misled us not only about science, but aboutthe obstacles blacks faced in his time.As subjects got softer, the lies got more frequent.  By the timeyou got to politics and recent history, what we were taught waspretty much pure propaganda.  For example, we were taught to regardpolitical leaders as saints—especially the recently martyredKennedy and King.  It was astonishing to learn later that they\\'dboth been serial womanizers, and that Kennedy was a speed freak toboot.  (By the time King\\'s plagiarism emerged, I\\'d lost the abilityto be surprised by the misdeeds of famous people.)I doubt you could teach kids recent history without teaching themlies, because practically everyone who has anything to say aboutit has some kind of spin to put on it.  Much recent historyconsistsof spin.  It would probably be better just to teach them metafactslike that.Probably the biggest lie told in schools, though, is that the wayto succeed is through following \"the rules.\"  In fact most suchrules are just hacks to manage large groups efficiently.PeaceOf all the reasons we lie to kids, the most powerful is probablythe same mundane reason they lie to us.Often when we lie to people it\\'s not part of any conscious strategy,but because they\\'d react violently to the truth.  Kids, almost bydefinition, lack self-control.  They react violently to things—andso they get lied to a lot.A few '},\n",

At thetime I had a self-interested motive for exploring the question. Atthat age (like most succeeding ages) I was always in trouble withthe authorities, and it seemed to me that there might possibly besome way to get out of trouble by arguing that I wasn\\'t responsiblefor my actions. I gradually lost hope of that, but the puzzleremained: How do you reconcile being a machine made of matter withthe feeling that you\\'re free to choose what you do?The best way to explain the answer may be to start with a slightlywrong version, and then fix it. The wrong version is: You can dowhat you want, but you can\\'t want what you want. Yes, you can controlwhat you do, but you\\'ll do what you want, and you can\\'t controlthat.The reason this is mistaken is that people do sometimes change whatthey want. People who don\\'t want to want something — drug addicts,for example — can sometimes make themselves stop wanting it. Andpeople who want to want something — who want to like classicalmusic, or broccoli — sometimes succeed.So we modify our initial statement: You can do what you want, butyou can\\'t want to want what you want.That\\'s still not quite true. It\\'s possible to change what you wantto want. I can imagine someone saying \"I decided to stop wantingto like classical music.\" But we\\'re getting closer to the truth.It\\'s rare for people to change what they want to want, and the more\"want to\"s we add, the rarer it gets.We can get arbitrarily close to a true statement by adding more \"wantto\"s in much the same way we can get arbitrarily close to 1 by addingmore 9s to a string of 9s following a decimal point. In practicethree or four \"want to\"s must surely be enough. It\\'s hard even toenvision what it would mean to change what you want to want to wantto want, let alone actually do it.So one way to express the correct answer is to use a regularexpression. You can do what you want, but there\\'s some statementof the form \"you can\\'t (want to)* want what you want\" that\\'s true.Ultimately you get back to a want that you don\\'t control.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'It might not seem there\\'s much to learn about how to work hard.Anyone who\\'s been to school knows what it entails, even if theychose not to do it. There are 12 year olds who work amazingly hard. Andyet when I ask if I know more about working hard now than when Iwas in school, the answer is definitely yes.One thing I know is that if you want to do great things, you\\'llhave to work very hard. I wasn\\'t sure of that as a kid. Schoolworkvaried in difficulty; one didn\\'t always have to work super hard todo well. And some of the things famous adults did, they seemed todo almost effortlessly. Was there, perhaps, some way to evade hardwork through sheer brilliance? Now I know the answer to that question.There isn\\'t.The reason some subjects seemed easy was that my school had lowstandards. And the reason famous adults seemed to do thingseffortlessly was years of practice; they made it look easy.Of course, those famous adults usually had a lot of natural abilitytoo. There are three ingredients in great work: natural ability,practice, and effort. You can do pretty well with just two, but todo the best work you need all three: you need great natural abilityandto have practiced a lotandto be trying very hard.Bill Gates, for example, was among the smartest people in businessin his era, but he was also among the hardest working. \"I nevertook a day off in my twenties,\" he said. \"Not one.\" It was similarwith Lionel Messi. He had great natural ability, but when his youthcoaches talk about him, what they remember is not his talent buthis dedication and his desire to win. P. G. Wodehouse would probablyget my vote for best English writer of the 20th century, if I hadto choose. Certainly no one ever made it look easier. But no oneever worked harder. At 74, he wrotewith each new book of mine I have, as I say, the feeling that  this time I have picked a lemon in the garden of literature. A  good thing, really, I suppose. Keeps one up on one\\'s toes and  makes one rewrite every sentence ten times. Or in many cases  twenty times.Sounds a bit extreme, you think. And yet Bill Gates sounds evenmore extreme. Not one day off in ten years?  These two had aboutas much natural ability as anyone could have, and yet they alsoworked about as hard as anyone could work. You need both.That seems so obvious, and yet in practice we find it slightly hardto grasp. There\\'s a faint xor between talent and hard work. It comespartly from popular culture, where it seems to run very deep, andpartly from the fact that the outliers are so rare. If great talentand great drive are both rare, then people with both are raresquared. Most people you meet who have a lot of one will have lessof the other. But you\\'ll need both if you want to be an outlieryourself. And since you can\\'t really change how much natural talentyou have, in practice doing great work, insofar as you can, reducesto working very hard.It\\'s straightforward to work hard if you have clearly defined,externally imposed goals, as you do in school. There is some techniqueto it: you have to learn not to lie to yourself, not to procrastinate(which is a form of lying to yourself), not to get distracted, andnot to give up when things go wrong. But this level of disciplineseems to be within the reach of quite young children, if they wantit.What I\\'ve learned since I was a kid is how to work toward goalsthat are neither clearly defined nor externally imposed. You\\'llprobably have to learn both if you want to do really great things.The most basic level of which is simply to feel you should be workingwithout anyone telling you to. Now, when I\\'m not working hard, alarmbells go off. I can\\'t be sure I\\'m getting anywhere when I\\'m workinghard, but I can be sure I\\'m getting nowhere when I\\'m not, and itfeels awful.There wasn\\'t a single point when I learned this. Like most littlekids, I enjoyed the feeling of achievement when I learned or didsomething new. As I grew older, this morphed into a feeling ofdisgust when I wasn\\'t achieving anything. The one precisely dateablelandmark I have is when I stopped watching TV, at age\\xa013.Several people I\\'ve talked to remember getting serious about workaround this age. When I asked Patrick Collison when he started tofind idleness distasteful, he saidI think around age 13 or 14. I have a clear memory from around  then of sitting in the sitting room, staring outside, and wondering  why I was wasting my summer holiday.Perhaps something changes at adolescence. That would make sense.Strangely enough, the biggest obstacle to getting serious aboutwork was probably school, which made work (what they called work)seem boring and pointless. I had to learn what real work was beforeI could wholeheartedly desire to do it. That took a while, becauseeven in college a lot of the work is pointless; there are entiredepartments that are pointless. But as I learned the shape of realwork, I found that my desire to do it slotted into it as if they\\'dbeen made for each other.I suspect most people have to learn what work is before they canlove it. Hardy wrote eloquently about this inA Mathematician\\'sApology:I do not remember having felt, as a boy, anypassionfor  mathematics, and such notions as I may have had of the career of  a mathematician were far from noble. I thought of mathematics in  terms of examinations and scholarships: I wanted to beat other  boys, and this seemed to be the way in which I could do so most  decisively.He didn\\'t learn what math was really about till part way throughcollege, when he read Jordan\\'sCours d\\'analyse.I shall never forget the astonishment with which I read that  remarkable work, the first inspiration for so many mathematicians  of my generation, and learnt for the first time as I read it what  mathematics really meant.There are two separate kinds of fakeness you need to learn todiscount in order to understand what real work is. One is the kindHardy encountered in school. Subjects get distorted when they\\'readapted to be taught to kids — often so distorted that they\\'renothing like the work done by actual practitioners.The otherkind of fakeness is intrinsic to certain types of work. Some typesof work are inherently bogus, or at best mere busywork.There\\'s a kind of solidity to real work. It\\'s not all writing thePrincipia, but it all feels necessary. That\\'s a vague criterion,but it\\'s deliberately vague, because it has to cover a lot ofdifferent types.Once you know the shape of real work, you have to learn how manyhours a day to spend on it. You can\\'t solve this problem by simplyworking every waking hour, because in many kinds of work there\\'s apoint beyond which the quality of the result will start to decline.That limit varies depending on the type of work and the person.I\\'ve done several different kinds of work, and the limits weredifferent for each. My limit for the harder types of writing orprogramming is about five hours a day. Whereas when I was runninga startup, I couldwork all the time. At least for the three years I did it; if I\\'dkept going much longer, I\\'d probably have needed to take occasionalvacations.The only way to find the limit is by crossing it. Cultivate asensitivity to the quality of the work you\\'re doing, and then you\\'llnotice if it decreases because you\\'re working too hard. Honesty iscritical here, in both directions: you have to notice when you\\'rebeing lazy, but also when you\\'re working too hard. And if you thinkthere\\'s something admirable about working too hard, get that ideaout of your head. You\\'re not merely getting worse results, butgetting them because you\\'re showing off — if not to other people,then to yourself.Finding the limit of working hard is a constant, ongoing process,not something you do just once. Both the difficulty of the work andyour ability to do it can vary hour to hour, so you need to beconstantly judging both how hard you\\'re trying and how well you\\'redoing.Trying hard doesn\\'t mean constantly pushing yourself to work, though.There may be some people who do, but I think my experience is fairlytypical, and I only have to push myself occasionally when I\\'mstarting a project or when I encounter some sort of check. That\\'swhen I\\'m in danger of procrastinating. But once I get rolling, Itend to keep going.What keeps me going depends on the type of work. When I was workingon Viaweb, I was driven by fear of failure. I barely procrastinatedat all then, because there was always something that needed doing,and if I could put more distance between me and the pursuing beastby doing it, why wait?Whereas what drives me now, writingessays, is the flaws in them. Between essays I fuss for a few days,like a dog circling while it decides exactly where to lie down. Butonce I get started on one, I don\\'t have to push myself to work,because there\\'s always some error or omission already pushing me.I do make some amount of effort to focus on important topics. Manyproblems have a hard core at the center, surrounded by easier stuffat the edges. Working hard means aiming toward the center to theextent you can. Some days you may not be able to; some days you\\'llonly be able to work on the easier, peripheral stuff. But you shouldalways be aiming as close to the center as you can without stalling.The bigger question of what to do with your life is one of theseproblems with a hard core. There are important problems at thecenter, which tend to be hard, and less important, easier ones atthe edges. So as well as the small, daily adjustments involved inworking on a specific problem, you\\'ll occasionally have to makebig, lifetime-scale adjustments about which type of work to do.And the rule is the same: working hard means aiming toward thecenter — toward the most ambitious problems.By center, though, I mean the actual center, not merely the currentconsensus about the center. The consensus about which problems aremost important is often mistaken, both in general and within specificfields. If you disagree with it, and you\\'re right, that couldrepresent a valuable opportunity to do something new.The more ambitious types of work will usually be harder, but althoughyou should not be in denial about this, neither should you treatdifficulty as an infallible guide in deciding what to do. If youdiscover some ambitious type of work that\\'s a bargain in the senseof being easier for you than other people, either because of theabilities you happen to have, or because of some new way you\\'vefound to approach it, or simply because you\\'re more excited aboutit, by all means work on that. Some of the best work is done bypeople who find an easy way to do something hard.As well as learning the shape of real work, you need to figure outwhich kind you\\'re suited for. And that doesn\\'t just mean figuringout which kind your natural abilities match the best; it doesn\\'tmean that if you\\'re 7 feet tall, you have to play basketball. Whatyou\\'re suited for depends not just on your talents but perhaps evenmore on your interests. Adeep interestin a topic makes peoplework harder than any amount of discipline can.It can be harder to discover your interests than your talents.There are fewer types of talent than interest, and they start tobe judged early in childhood, whereas interest in a topic is asubtle thing that may not mature till your twenties, or even later.The topic may not even exist earlier. Plus there are some powerfulsources of error you need to learn to discount. Are you reallyinterested in x, or do you want to work on it because you\\'ll makea lot of money, or because other people will be impressed with you,or because your parents want you to?The difficulty of figuring out what to work on varies enormouslyfrom one person to another. That\\'s one of the most important thingsI\\'ve learned about work since I was a kid. As a kid, you get theimpression that everyone has a calling, and all they have to do isfigure out what it is. That\\'s how it works in movies, and in thestreamlined biographies fed to kids. Sometimes it works that wayin real life. Some people figure out what to do as children andjust do it, like Mozart. But others, like Newton, turn restlesslyfrom one kind of work to another. Maybe in retrospect we can identifyone as their calling — we can wish Newton spent more time on mathand physics and less on alchemy and theology — but this is anillusioninduced by hindsight bias. There was no voice calling to him that he could have heard.So while some people\\'s lives converge fast, there will be otherswhose lives never converge. And for these people, figuring out whatto work on is not so much a prelude to working hard as an ongoingpart of it, like one of a set of simultaneous equations. For thesepeople, the process I described earlier has a third component: alongwith measuring both how hard you\\'re working and how well you\\'redoing, you have to think about whether you should keep working inthis field or switch to another. If you\\'re working hard but notgetting good enough results, you should switch. It sounds simpleexpressed that way, but in practice it\\'s very difficult. You shouldn\\'tgive up on the first day just because you work hard and don\\'t getanywhere. You need to give yourself time to get going. But how muchtime? And what should you do if work that was going well stops goingwell? How much time do you give yourself then?What even counts as good results? That can be really hard to decide.If you\\'re exploring an area few others have worked in, you may noteven know what good results look like. History is full of examplesof people who misjudged the importance of what they were workingon.The best test of whether it\\'s worthwhile to work on something iswhether you find it interesting. That may sound like a dangerouslysubjective measure, but it\\'s probably the most accurate one you\\'regoing to get. You\\'re the one working on the stuff. Who\\'s in a betterposition than you to judge whether it\\'s important, and what\\'s abetter predictor of its importance than whether it\\'s interesting?For this test to work, though, you have to be honest with yourself.Indeed, that\\'s the most striking thing about the whole question ofworking hard: how at each point it depends on being honest withyourself.Working hard is not just a dial you turn up to 11. It\\'s a complicated,dynamic system that has to be tuned just right at each point. Youhave to understand the shape of real work, see clearly what kindyou\\'re best suited for, aim as close to the true core of it as youcan, accurately judge at each moment both what you\\'re capable ofand how you\\'re doing, and put in as many hours each day as you canwithout harming the quality of the result. This network is toocomplicated to trick. But if you\\'re consistently honest andclear-sighted, it will automatically assume an optimal shape, andyou\\'ll be productive in a way few people are.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Publishers of all types, from news to music, are unhappy thatconsumers won\\'t pay for content anymore.  At least, that\\'s how theysee it.In fact consumers never really were paying for content, and publishersweren\\'t really selling it either.  If the content was what theywere selling, why has the price of books or music or movies alwaysdepended mostly on the format?  Why didn\\'t better content cost more?A copy ofTimecosts $5 for 58 pages, or 8.6 cents a page.The Economistcosts $7 for 86 pages, or 8.1 cents a page.  Betterjournalism is actually slightly cheaper.Almost every form of publishing has been organized as if the mediumwas what they were selling, and the content was irrelevant.  Bookpublishers, for example, set prices based on the cost of producingand distributing books.  They treat the words printed in the bookthe same way a textile manufacturer treats the patterns printed onits fabrics.Economically, the print media are in the business of marking uppaper.  We can all imagine an old-style editor getting a scoop andsaying \"this will sell a lot of papers!\" Cross out that final S andyou\\'re describing their business model.  The reason they make lessmoney now is that people don\\'t need as much paper.A few months ago I ran into a friend in a cafe.  I had a copy oftheNew York Times, which I still occasionally buy on weekends.  AsI was leaving I offered it to him, as I\\'ve done countless timesbefore in the same situation.  But this time something new happened.I felt that sheepish feeling you get when you offer someone somethingworthless.  \"Do you, er, want a printout of yesterday\\'s news?\" Iasked.  (He didn\\'t.)Now that the medium is evaporating, publishers have nothing leftto sell.  Some seem to think they\\'re going to sell content—thatthey were always in the content business, really.  But they weren\\'t,and it\\'s unclear whether anyone could be.SellingThere have always been people in the business of selling information,but that has historically been a distinct business from publishing.And the business of selling information to consumers has alwaysbeen a marginal one.  When I was a kid there were people who usedto sell newsletters containing stock tips, printed on colored paperthat made them hard for the copiers of the day to reproduce.  Thatis a different world, both culturally and economically, from theone publishers currently inhabit.People will pay for information they think they can make money from.That\\'s why they paid for those stock tip newsletters, and whycompanies pay now for Bloomberg terminals and Economist IntelligenceUnit reports.  But will people pay for information otherwise?History offers little encouragement.If audiences were willing to pay more for better content, why wasn\\'tanyone already selling it to them?  There was no reason you couldn\\'thave done that in the era of physical media.  So were the printmedia and the music labels simply overlooking this opportunity?  Oris it, rather, nonexistent?What about iTunes?  Doesn\\'t that show people will pay for content?Well, not really. iTunes is more of a tollbooth than a store.  Applecontrols the default path onto the iPod.  They offer a convenientlist of songs, and whenever you choose one they ding your creditcard for a small amount, just below the threshold of attention.Basically, iTunes makes money by taxing people, not selling themstuff.  You can only do that if you own the channel, and even thenyou don\\'t make much from it, because a toll has to be ignorable towork.  Once a toll becomes painful, people start to find ways aroundit, and that\\'s pretty easy with digital content.The situation is much the same with digital books.  Whoever controlsthe device sets the terms.  It\\'s in their interest for content tobe as cheap as possible, and since they own the channel, there\\'s alot they can do to drive prices down.  Prices will fall even furtheronce writers realize they don\\'t need publishers.  Getting a bookprinted and distributed is a daunting prospect for a writer, butmost can upload a file.Is software a counterexample?  People pay a lot for desktop software,and that\\'s just information.  True, but I don\\'t think publisherscan learn much from software.  Software companies can charge a lotbecause (a) many of the customers are businesses, who get introubleif they use pirated versions, and (b) though in form merelyinformation, software is treated by both maker and purchaser as adifferent type of thing from a song or an article.   A Photoshopuser needs Photoshop in a way that no one needs a particular songor article.That\\'s why there\\'s a separate word, \"content,\" for informationthat\\'s not software.  Software is a different business.  Softwareand content blur together in some of the most lightweight software,like casual games.  But those are usually free.   To make money theway software companies do, publishers would have to become softwarecompanies, and being publishers gives them no particular head startin that domain.The most promising countertrend is the premium cable channel.  Peoplestill pay for those.  But broadcasting isn\\'t publishing: you\\'re notselling a copy of something.  That\\'s one reason the movie businesshasn\\'t seen their revenues decline the way the news and musicbusinesses have.  They only have one foot in publishing.To the extent the movie business can avoid becoming publishers,they may avoid publishing\\'s problems.  But there are limits to howwell they\\'ll be able to do that.  Once publishing—giving peoplecopies—becomes the most natural way of distributing your content,it probably doesn\\'t work to stick to old forms of distribution justbecause you make more that way.  If free copies of your content areavailable online, then you\\'re competing with publishing\\'s form ofdistribution, and that\\'s just as bad as being a publisher.Apparently some people in the music business hope to retroactivelyconvert it away from publishing, by getting listeners to pay forsubscriptions.  It seems unlikely that will work if they\\'re juststreaming the same files you can get as mp3s.NextWhat happens to publishing if you can\\'t sell content?  You have twochoices: give it away and make money from it indirectly, or findways to embody it in things people will pay for.The first is probably the future of most current media.Give musicawayand make money from concerts and t-shirts.  Publish articlesfor free and make money from one of a dozen permutations ofadvertising.  Both publishers and investors are down on advertisingat the moment, but it has more potential than they realize.I\\'m not claiming that potential will be realized by the existingplayers.  Theoptimalways to make money from the written wordprobably require different words written by different people.It\\'s harder to say what will happen to movies.  They could evolveinto ads.  Or they could return to their roots and make going tothe theater a treat.  If they made the experience good enough,audiences might start to prefer it to watching pirated movies athome.Or maybe the movie business will dry up, and the peopleworking in it will go to work for game developers.I don\\'t know how big embodying information in physical form willbe.  It may be surprisingly large; people overvaluephysical stuff.There should remain some market for printed books, at least.I can see the evolution of book publishing in the books on myshelves.  Clearly at some point in the 1960s the big publishinghouses started to ask: how cheaply can we make books before peoplerefuse to buy them?  The answer turned out to be one step short ofphonebooks.  As long as it isn\\'t floppy, consumers still perceiveit as a book.That worked as long as buying printed books was the only way toread them.  If printed books are optional, publishers will have towork harder to entice people to buy them.  There should be somemarket, but it\\'s hard to foresee how big, because its size willdepend not on macro trends like the amount people read, but on theingenuity of individual publishers.Some magazines may thrive by focusing on the magazine as a physicalobject.  Fashion magazines could be made lush in a way that wouldbe hard to match digitally, at least for a while.  But this isprobably not an option for most magazines.I don\\'t know exactly what the future will look like, but I\\'m nottoo worried about it.  This sort of change tends to create as manygood things as it kills.  Indeed, the really interesting question is notwhat will happen to existing forms, but what new forms will appear.The reason I\\'ve been writing about existing forms is that I don\\'tknowwhat new forms will appear.  But though I can\\'t predictspecific winners, I can offer a recipe for recognizing them.  Whenyou see something that\\'s taking advantage of new technology to givepeople something they want that they couldn\\'t have before, you\\'reprobably looking at a winner.  And when you see something that\\'smerely reacting to new technology in an attempt to preserve someexisting source of revenue, you\\'re probably looking at a loser.'},\n",

In a hundred subtle ways, the city sends you amessage: you could do more; you should try harder.The surprising thing is how different these messages can be.  NewYork tells you, above all: you should make more money.  There areother messages too, of course.  You should be hipper.  You shouldbe better looking.  But the clearest message is that you should bericher.What I like about Boston (or rather Cambridge) is that the messagethere is: you should be smarter.  You really should get around toreading all those books you\\'ve been meaning to.When you ask what message a city sends, you sometimes get surprisinganswers.  As much as they respect brains in Silicon Valley, themessage the Valley sends is: you should be more powerful.That\\'s not quite the same message New York sends.  Power mattersin New York too of course, but New York is pretty impressed by abillion dollars even if you merely inherited it.  In Silicon Valleyno one would care except a few real estate agents.  What mattersin Silicon Valley is how much effect you have on the world.  Thereason people there care about Larry and Sergey is not their wealthbut the fact that they control Google, which affects practicallyeveryone._____How much does it matter what message a city sends?  Empirically,the answer seems to be: a lot. You might think that if you hadenough strength of mind to do great things, you\\'d be able to transcendyour environment.  Where you live should make at most a couplepercent difference.  But if you look at the historical evidence,it seems to matter more than that.  Most people who did great thingswere clumped together in a few places where that sort of thing wasdone at the time.You can see how powerful cities are from something I wrote aboutearlier: the case of the Milanese Leonardo.  Practically everyfifteenth century Italian painter you\\'ve heard of was from Florence,even though Milan was just as big.  People in Florence weren\\'tgenetically different, so you have to assume there was someone bornin Milan with as much natural ability as Leonardo.  What happenedto him?If even someone with the same natural ability as Leonardocouldn\\'t beat the force of environment, do you suppose you can?I don\\'t.  I\\'m fairly stubborn, but I wouldn\\'t try to fight thisforce.  I\\'d rather use it.  So I\\'ve thought a lot about where tolive.I\\'d always imagined Berkeley would be the ideal place — thatit would basically be Cambridge with good weather.  But when Ifinally tried living there a couple years ago, it turned out notto be.  The message Berkeley sends is: you should live better.  Lifein Berkeley is very civilized.  It\\'s probably the place in Americawhere someone from Northern Europe would feel most at home.  Butit\\'s not humming with ambition.In retrospect it shouldn\\'t have been surprising that a place sopleasant would attract people interested above all in quality oflife.  Cambridge with good weather, it turns out, is not Cambridge.The people you find in Cambridge are not there by accident.  Youhave to make sacrifices to live there.  It\\'s expensive and somewhatgrubby, and the weather\\'s often bad.  So the kind of people youfind in Cambridge are the kind of people who want to live where thesmartest people are, even if that means living in an expensive,grubby place with bad weather.As of this writing, Cambridge seems to be the intellectual capitalof the world.  I realize that seems a preposterous claim.  Whatmakes it true is that it\\'s more preposterous to claim about anywhereelse.  American universities currently seem to be the best, judgingfrom the flow of ambitious students.  And what US city has a strongerclaim?  New York?  A fair number of smart people, but diluted by amuch larger number of neanderthals in suits.  The Bay Area has alot of smart people too, but again, diluted;  there are two greatuniversities, but they\\'re far apart.  Harvard and MIT are practicallyadjacent by West Coast standards, and they\\'re surrounded by about20 other colleges and universities.Cambridge as a result feels like a town whose main industry isideas, while New York\\'s is finance and Silicon Valley\\'s is startups._____When you talk about cities in the sense we are, what you\\'re reallytalking about is collections of people.  For a long time citieswere the only large collections of people, so you could use the twoideas interchangeably.  But we can see how much things are changingfrom the examples I\\'ve mentioned.  New York is a classic great city.But Cambridge is just part of a city, and Silicon Valley is noteven that.  (San Jose is not, as it sometimes claims, the capitalof Silicon Valley.  It\\'s just 178 square miles at one end of it.)Maybe the Internet will change things further.  Maybe one day themost important community you belong to will be a virtual one, andit won\\'t matter where you live physically.  But I wouldn\\'t bet onit.  The physical world is very high bandwidth, and some of theways cities send you messages are quite subtle.One of the exhilarating things about coming back to Cambridge everyspring is walking through the streets at dusk, when you can seeinto the houses.  When you walk through Palo Alto in the evening,you see nothing but the blue glow of TVs.  In Cambridge you seeshelves full of promising-looking books.  Palo Alto was probablymuch like Cambridge in 1960, but you\\'d never guess now that therewas a university nearby.  Now it\\'s just one of the richer neighborhoodsin Silicon Valley.A city speaks to you mostly by accident — in things you seethrough windows, in conversations you overhear.  It\\'s not somethingyou have to seek out, but something you can\\'t turn off.  One of theoccupational hazards of living in Cambridge is overhearing theconversations of people who use interrogative intonation in declarativesentences.  But on average I\\'ll take Cambridge conversations overNew York or Silicon Valley ones.A friend who moved to Silicon Valley in the late 90s said the worstthing about living there was the low quality of the eavesdropping.At the time I thought she was being deliberately eccentric. Sure,it can be interesting to eavesdrop on people, but is good qualityeavesdropping so important that it would affect where you chose tolive?  Now I understand what she meant.  The conversations youoverhear tell you what sort of people you\\'re among._____No matter how determined you are, it\\'s hard not to be influencedby the people around you.  It\\'s not so much that you do whatever acity expects of you, but that you get discouraged when no one aroundyou cares about the same things you do.There\\'s an imbalance between encouragement and discouragement likethat between gaining and losing money.  Most people overvaluenegative amounts of money: they\\'ll work much harder to avoid losinga dollar than to gain one.  Similarly, although there are plenty ofpeople strong enough to resist doing something just because that\\'swhat one is supposed to do where they happen to be, there are fewstrong enough to keep working on something no one around them caresabout.Because ambitions are to some extent incompatible and admirationis a zero-sum game, each city tends to focus on one type of ambition.The reason Cambridge is the intellectual capital is not just thatthere\\'s a concentration of smart people there, but that there\\'snothingelsepeople there care about more.  Professors inNew York and the Bay area are second class citizens — till theystart hedge funds or startups respectively.This suggests an answer to a question people in New York havewondered about since the Bubble: whether New York could grow intoa startup hub to rival Silicon Valley.  One reason that\\'s unlikelyis that someone starting a startup in New York would feel like asecond class citizen.There\\'s already something else people in New York admire more.In the long term, that could be a bad thing for New York.  The powerof an important new technology does eventually convert to money.So by caring more about money and less about power than SiliconValley, New York is recognizing the same thing, but slower.And in fact it has been losing to Silicon Valley at its own game:the ratio of New York to California residents in the Forbes 400 hasdecreased from 1.45 (81:56) when the list was first published in1982 to .83 (73:88) in 2007._____Not all cities send a message.  Only those that are centers forsome type of ambition do.  And it can be hard to tell exactly whatmessage a city sends without living there.  I understand the messagesof New York, Cambridge, and Silicon Valley because I\\'ve lived forseveral years in each of them.  DC and LA seem to send messagestoo, but I haven\\'t spent long enough in either to say for sure whatthey are.The big thing in LA seems to be fame.  There\\'s an A List of peoplewho are most in demand right now, and what\\'s most admired is to beon it, or friends with those who are.  Beneath that, the message ismuch like New York\\'s, though perhaps with more emphasis on physicalattractiveness.In DC the message seems to be that the most important thing is whoyou know.  You want to be an insider.  In practice this seems towork much as in LA.  There\\'s an A List and you want to be on it orclose to those who are.  The only difference is how the A List isselected.  And even that is not that different.At the moment, San Francisco\\'s message seems to be the same asBerkeley\\'s: you should live better.  But this will change if enoughstartups choose SF over the Valley.  During the Bubble that was apredictor of failure — a self-indulgent choice, like buyingexpensive office furniture.  Even now I\\'m suspicious when startupschoose SF.  But if enough good ones do, it stops being a self-indulgentchoice, because the center of gravity of Silicon Valley will shiftthere.I haven\\'t found anything like Cambridge for intellectual ambition.Oxford and Cambridge (England) feel like Ithaca or Hanover: themessage is there, but not as strong.Paris was once a great intellectual center.  If you went there in1300, it might have sent the message Cambridge does now.  But Itried living there for a bit last year, and the ambitions of theinhabitants are not intellectual ones.  The message Paris sends nowis: do things with style.  I liked that, actually.  Paris is theonly city I\\'ve lived in where people genuinely cared about art.  InAmerica only a few rich people buy original art, and even the moresophisticated ones rarely get past judging it by the brand name ofthe artist.  But looking through windows at dusk in Paris you cansee that people there actually care what paintings look like.Visually, Paris has the best eavesdropping I know.There\\'s one more message I\\'ve heard from cities: in London you canstill (barely) hear the message that one should be more aristocratic.If you listen for it you can also hear it in Paris, New York, andBoston.  But this message is everywhere very faint.  It would havebeen strong 100 years ago, but now I probably wouldn\\'t have pickedit up at all if I hadn\\'t deliberately tuned in to that wavelengthto see if there was any signal left._____So far the complete list of messages I\\'ve picked up from cities is:wealth, style, hipness, physical attractiveness, fame, politicalpower, economic power, intelligence, social class, and quality oflife.My immediate reaction to this list is that it makes me slightlyqueasy.  I\\'d always considered ambition a good thing, but I realizenow that was because I\\'d always implicitly understood it to meanambition in the areas I cared about.  When you list everythingambitious people are ambitious about, it\\'s not so pretty.On closer examination I see a couple things on the list that aresurprising in the light of history.  For example, physicalattractiveness wouldn\\'t have been there 100 years ago (though itmight have been 2400 years ago).  It has always mattered for women,but in the late twentieth century it seems to have started to matterfor men as well.  I\\'m not sure why — probably some combinationof the increasing power of women, the increasing influence of actorsas models, and the fact that so many people work in offices now:you can\\'t show off by wearing clothes too fancy to wear in a factory,so you have to show off with your body instead.Hipness is another thing you wouldn\\'t have seen on the list 100years ago.  Or wouldn\\'t you?  What it means is to know what\\'s what.So maybe it has simply replaced the component of social class thatconsisted of being \"au fait.\"  That could explain why hipness seemsparticularly admired in London: it\\'s version 2 of the traditionalEnglish delight in obscure codes that only insiders understand.Economic power would have been on the list 100 years ago, but whatwe mean by it is changing.  It used to mean the control of vasthuman and material resources.  But increasingly it means the abilityto direct the course of technology, and some of the people in aposition to do that are not even rich — leaders of importantopen source projects, for example.  The Captains of Industry oftimes past had laboratories full of clever people cooking up newtechnologies for them.  The new breed are themselves those people.As this force gets more attention, another is dropping off the list:social class.  I think the two changes are related.  Economic power,wealth, and social class are just names for the same thing atdifferent stages in its life: economic power converts to wealth,and wealth to social class.  So the focus of admiration is simplyshifting upstream._____Does anyone who wants to do great work have to live in a great city?No; all great cities inspire some sort of ambition, but they aren\\'tthe only places that do.  For some kinds of work, all you need isa handful of talented colleagues.What cities provide is an audience, and a funnel for peers.  Thesearen\\'t so critical in something like math or physics, where noaudience matters except your peers, and judging ability is sufficientlystraightforward that hiring and admissions committees can do itreliably.  In a field like math or physics all you need is adepartment with the right colleagues in it.  It could be anywhere — inLos Alamos, New Mexico, for example.It\\'s in fields like the arts or writing or technology that thelarger environment matters.  In these the best practitioners aren\\'tconveniently collected in a few top university departments andresearch labs — partly because talent is harder to judge, andpartly because people pay for these things, so one doesn\\'t need torely on teaching or research funding to support oneself.  It\\'s inthese more chaotic fields that it helps most to be in a great city:you need the encouragement of feeling that people around you careabout the kind of work you do, and since you have to find peers foryourself, you need the much larger intake mechanism of a great city.You don\\'t have to live in a great city your whole life to benefitfrom it.  The critical years seem to be the early and middle onesof your career.  Clearly you don\\'t have to grow up in a great city.Nor does it seem to matter if you go to college in one.  To mostcollege students a world of a few thousand people seems big enough.Plus in college you don\\'t yet have to face the hardest kind ofwork — discovering new problems to solve.It\\'s when you move on to the next and much harder step that it helpsmost to be in a place where you can find peers and encouragement.You seem to be able to leave, if you want, once you\\'ve found both.The Impressionists show the typical pattern: they were born allover France (Pissarro was born in the Carribbean) and died all overFrance, but what defined them were the years they spent togetherin Paris._____Unless you\\'re sure what you want to do and where the leading centerfor it is, your best bet is probably to try living in severalplaces when you\\'re young.  You can never tell what message a citysends till you live there, or even whether it still sends one.Often your information will be wrong: I tried living in Florencewhen I was 25, thinking it would be an art center, but it turnedout I was 450 years too late.Even when a city is still a live center of ambition, you won\\'t knowfor sure whether its message will resonate with you till you hearit.  When I moved to New York, I was very excited at first.  It\\'san exciting place.  So it took me quite a while to realize I justwasn\\'t like the people there.  I kept searching for the Cambridgeof New York.  It turned out it was way, way uptown: an hour uptownby air.Some people know at 16 what sort of work they\\'re going to do, butin most ambitious kids, ambition seems to precede anything specificto be ambitious about.  They know they want to do something great.They just haven\\'t decided yet whether they\\'re going to be a rockstar or a brain surgeon.  There\\'s nothing wrong with that.  But itmeans if you have this most common type of ambition, you\\'ll probablyhave to figure out where to live by trial and error.  You\\'llprobably have to find the city where you feel at home to know what sort ofambition you have.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Yesterday one of the founders we funded asked me why we startedYCombinator.  Or more precisely, he asked if we\\'d started YC mainlyfor fun.Kind of, but not quite.  It is enormously fun to be able to workwith Rtm and Trevor again.  I missed that after we sold Viaweb, andfor all the years after I always had a background process running,looking for something we could do together.  There is definitelyan aspect of a band reunion to Y Combinator.  Every couple days Islip and call it \"Viaweb.\"Viaweb we started very explicitly to make money.  I was sick ofliving from one freelance project to the next, and decided to justwork as hard as I could till I\\'d made enough to solve the problemonce and for all.  Viaweb was sometimes fun, but it wasn\\'t designedfor fun, and mostly it wasn\\'t.  I\\'d be surprised if any startup is.All startups are mostly schleps.The real reason we started Y Combinator is neither selfish norvirtuous.  We didn\\'t start it mainly to make money; we have no ideawhat our average returns might be, and won\\'t know for years.  Nordid we start YC mainly to help out young would-be founders, thoughwe do like the idea, and comfort ourselves occasionally with thethought that if all our investments tank, we will thus have beendoing something unselfish.  (It\\'s oddly nondeterministic.)The real reason we started Y Combinator is one probably only ahackerwould understand.  We did it because it seems such a greathack.  There are thousands of smart people who could start companiesand don\\'t, and with a relatively small amount of force applied atjust the right place, we can spring on the world a stream of newstartups that might otherwise not have existed.In a way this is virtuous, because I think startups are a goodthing.  But really what motivates us is the completely amoral desirethat would motivate any hacker who looked at some complex deviceand realized that with a tiny tweak he could make it run moreefficiently.  In this case, the device is the world\\'s economy, whichfortunately happens to be open source.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'Microsoft is Dead',\n",
       "  'date': 'April 2007',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'A few days ago I suddenly realized Microsoft was dead.  I was talkingto a young startup founder about how Google was different fromYahoo.  I said that Yahoo had been warped from the start bytheir fear of Microsoft.  That was why they\\'d positioned themselvesas a \"media company\" instead of a technology company.  Then I lookedat his face and realized he didn\\'t understand.  It was as if I\\'dtold him how much girls liked Barry Manilow in the mid80s.  Barry who?Microsoft?  He didn\\'t say anything, but I could tell he didn\\'t quitebelieve anyone would be frightened of them.Microsoft casta shadow over the software world for almost 20 yearsstarting in the late 80s.I can remember when it was IBM before them.  I mostly ignored thisshadow.  I never used Microsoft software, so it only affected meindirectly—for example, in the spam I got from botnets.  Andbecause I wasn\\'t paying attention, I didn\\'t notice when the shadowdisappeared.But it\\'s gone now.  I can sense that.  No one is even afraid ofMicrosoft anymore.  They still make a lot of money—so does IBM,for that matter.  But they\\'re not dangerous.When did Microsoft die, and of what?  I know they seemed dangerousas late as 2001, because I wrote anessaythen about how they wereless dangerous than they seemed.   I\\'d guess they were dead by 2005.I know when we started Y Combinator we didn\\'t worry about Microsoftas competition for the startups we funded.  In fact, we\\'ve nevereven invited them to the demo days we organize for startups topresent to investors.  We invite Yahoo and Google and some otherInternet companies, but we\\'ve never bothered to invite Microsoft.Nor has anyone there ever even sent us an email.  They\\'re in adifferent world.What killed them?  Four things, I think, all of them occurringsimultaneously in the mid 2000s.The most obvious is Google.  There can only be one big man in town,and they\\'re clearly it.  Google is the most dangerous companynow by far, in both the good and bad senses of the word.  Microsoftcan at bestlimpalong afterward.When did Google take the lead?  There will be a tendency to pushit back to their IPO in August 2004, but they weren\\'t setting theterms of the debate then.  I\\'d say they took the lead in2005.  Gmail was one of the things that put them over the edge.Gmail showed they could do more than search.Gmail also showed how much you could do with web-based software,if you took advantage of what later came to be called \"Ajax.\" Andthat was the second cause of Microsoft\\'s death: everyone can see thedesktop is over.  It now seems inevitable that applications willlive on the web—not just email, but everything, right up toPhotoshop.  Even Microsoft sees that now.Ironically, Microsoft unintentionally helped create Ajax.  The xin Ajax is from the XMLHttpRequest object, which lets the browsercommunicate with the server in the background while displaying a page.(Originally the only way to communicate with the server was to ask for a new page.) XMLHttpRequest was created by Microsoft in the late 90sbecause they needed it for Outlook.  What they didn\\'t realize wasthat it would be useful to a lot of other people too—in fact, toanyone who wanted to make web apps work like desktop ones.The other critical component of Ajax is Javascript, the programminglanguage that runs in the browser.  Microsoft saw the danger ofJavascript and tried to keep it broken for as long as they could.But eventually the open source world won, by producingJavascript libraries that grew over the brokenness of Explorerthe way a tree grows over barbed wire.The third cause of Microsoft\\'s death was broadband Internet.  Anyonewho cares can have fast Internet accessnow.  And the bigger the pipe to the server, the less you need thedesktop.The last nail in the coffin came, of all places, from Apple.  '},\n",

       "  'date': 'Want to start a startup?',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.January 2012A year ago I noticed a pattern in the least successful startupswe\\'d funded: they all seemed hard to talk to.  It felt as if therewas some kind of wall between us.  I could never quite tell if theyunderstood what I was saying.This caught my attention because earlier we\\'d noticed a patternamong the most successful startups, and it seemed to hinge on adifferent quality.  We found the startups that did best were theones with the sort of founders about whom we\\'d say \"they can takecare of themselves.\"  The startups that do best are fire-and-forgetin the sense that all you have to do is give them a lead, and they\\'llclose it, whatever type of lead it is.  When they\\'re raising money,for example, you can do the initial intros knowing that if youwanted to you could stop thinking about it at that point.  You won\\'thave to babysit the round to make sure it happens.  That type offounder is going to come back with the money; the only question ishow much on what terms.It seemed odd that the outliers at the two ends of the spectrumcould be detected by what appeared to be unrelated tests.  You\\'dexpect that if the founders at one end were distinguished by thepresence of quality x, at the other end they\\'d be distinguished bylack of x.  Was there some kind of inverse relation betweenresourcefulnessand being hard to talk to?It turns out there is, and the key to the mystery is the old adage\"a word to the wise is sufficient.\"   Because this phrase is notonly overused, but overused in an indirect way (by prepending thesubject to some advice), most people who\\'ve heard it don\\'t knowwhat it means.  What it means is that if someone is wise, all youhave to do is say one word to them, and they\\'ll understand immediately.You don\\'t have to explain in detail; they\\'ll chase down all theimplications.In much the same way that all you have to do is give the right sortof founder a one line intro to a VC, and he\\'ll chase down the money.That\\'s the connection.  Understanding all the implications — even theinconvenient implications — of what someone tells you is a subset ofresourcefulness.  It\\'s conversational resourcefulness.Like real world resourcefulness, conversational resourcefulnessoften means doing things you don\\'t want to.  Chasing down all theimplications of what\\'s said to you can sometimes lead to uncomfortableconclusions.  The best word to describe the failure to do so isprobably \"denial,\" though that seems a bit too narrow.  A betterway to describe the situation would be to say that the unsuccessfulfounders had the sort of conservatism that comes from weakness.They traversed idea space as gingerly as a very old persontraverses the physical world.The unsuccessful founders weren\\'t stupid.  Intellectually theywere as capable asthe successful founders of following all the implications of whatone said to them.  They just weren\\'t eager to.So being hard to talk to was not what was killing theunsuccessful startups.  Itwas a sign of an underlying lack of resourcefulness.  That\\'s whatwas killing them.  As well asfailing to chase down the implications of what was said to them,the unsuccessful founders would also fail to chase down funding,and users, and sources of new ideas.  But the most immediate evidenceI had that something was amiss was that I couldn\\'t talk to them.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'A Plan for Spam',\n",
       "  'date': 'Like to build things?',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'TryHackerNews.August 2002(This article describes the spam-filtering techniquesused in the spamproof web-based mail reader webuilt to exerciseArc. Animproved algorithm is described inBetterBayesian Filtering.)I think it\\'s possible to stop spam, and that content-based filters are the way to do it.The Achilles heel of the spammers is their message.They can circumvent any other barrier you set up.  They have so far, atleast.  But they have to deliver their message, whatever itis.  If we can write software that recognizes their messages,there is no way they can get around that._ _ _To the recipient, spam is easily recognizable.  If you hired someone to read your mail and discard the spam, they wouldhave little trouble doing it.  How much do we haveto do, short of AI, to automate this process?I think we will be able to solve the problem with fairlysimple algorithms.  In fact, I\\'ve found that you can filterpresent-day spam acceptably well using nothing more than aBayesian combination of the spam probabilities of individualwords.  Using a slightly tweaked (as described below) Bayesianfilter, we now miss less than 5 per 1000 spams, with 0 false positives.The statistical approach is not usually the first one peopletry when they write spam filters.  Most hackers\\' first instinct isto try to write software that recognizes individual properties ofspam.  You look at spamsand you think, the gall of these guys to try sending me mail that begins \"Dear Friend\" or has a subject line that\\'s alluppercase and ends in eight exclamation points.  I can filterout that stuff with about one line of code.And so you do,and in the beginning it works.  A few simple rules will takea big bite out of your incoming spam.  Merely lookingfor the word \"click\" will catch 79.7% of theemails in my spam corpus, with only 1.2% false positives.I spent about six months writing software that looked forindividual spam features before I tried the statisticalapproach.  What I found was that recognizing that last fewpercent of spams got very hard, and that as Imade the filters stricter I got more false positives.False positives are innocent emails that get mistakenlyidentified as spams.For most users,missing legitimate email isan order of magnitude worse than receiving spam, so afilter that yields false positives is like an acne curethat carries a risk of death to the patient.The more spam a user gets, the lesslikely he\\'ll be to notice one innocent mail sitting in hisspam folder.  And strangely enough, the better your spam filters get,the more dangerous false positives become, because when thefilters are really good, users will be more likely toignore everything they catch.I don\\'t know why I avoided trying the statistical approachfor so long.  I think it was because I got addicted totrying to identify spam features myself, as if I were playingsome kind of competitive game with the spammers.  (Nonhackersdon\\'t often realize this, but most hackers are very competitive.)When I did try statistical analysis, Ifound immediately that it was much cleverer than I had been.It discovered, of course, that terms like \"virtumundo\" and\"teens\" were good indicators of spam.  But it alsodiscovered that \"per\" and \"FL\" and \"ff0000\" are good indicators of spam.  In fact, \"ff0000\" (html for bright red)turns out to be as good an indicator of spam as any  pornographic term._ _ _Here\\'s a sketch of how I do statistical filtering.  I startwith one corpus of spam and one of nonspam mail.  At themoment each one has about 4000 messages in it.  I scanthe entire text, including headers and embedded htmland javascript, of each message in each corpus.I currently consider alphanumeric characters,dashes, apostrophes, and dollar signs to be part of tokens,and everything else to be a token separator.  (There isprobably room for improvement here.)  I ignore tokens thatare all digits, and I also ignore html comments, not evenconsidering them as token separators.I count the numberof times each token (ignoring case, currently) occurs ineach corpus.  At this stage I end up with two large hash   tables, one for each corpus, mapping tokens to numberof occurrences.Next I create a third hash table, this time mappingeach token to the probability that an email containing it is a spam,which I calculate as follows [1]:(let ((g (* 2 (or (gethash word good) 0)))      (b (or (gethash word bad) 0)))   (unless (< (+ g b) 5)     (max .01          (min .99 (float (/ (min 1 (/ b nbad))                             (+ (min 1 (/ g ngood))                                   (min 1 (/ b nbad)))))))))wherewordis the token whose probability we\\'recalculating,goodandbadare the hash tablesI created in the first step, andngoodandnbadare the number of nonspam and spam messages respectively.I explained this as code to show a couple of important details.I want to bias the probabilities slightly to avoid falsepositives, and by trial and error I\\'ve found that a goodway to do it is to double all the numbers ingood.This helps to distinguish between words that occasionallydo occur in legitimate email and words that almost never do. I only consider words that occur more than five times intotal (actually, because of the doubling, occurring three times in nonspam mail would be enough).  And then there isthe question of what probability to assign to words thatoccur in one corpus but not the other.  Again by trial and   error I chose .01 and .99.  There may be room for tuninghere, but as the corpus grows such tuning will happenautomatically anyway.The especially observant will notice that while I considereach corpus to be a single long stream of text for purposesof counting occurrences, I use the number of emails ineach, rather than their combined length, as the divisor     in calculating spam probabilities.  This adds anotherslight bias to protect against false positives.When new mail arrives, it is scanned into tokens, andthe most interesting fifteen tokens, where interesting is  measured by how far their spam probability is from aneutral .5, are used to calculate the probability thatthe mail is spam.  Ifprobsis a list of the fifteen individual probabilities, youcalculate thecombinedprobability thus:(let ((prod (apply #\\'* probs)))  (/ prod (+ prod (apply #\\'* (mapcar #\\'(lambda (x)                                          (- 1 x))                                     probs)))))One question that arises inpractice is what probability to assign to a word you\\'venever seen, i.e. one that doesn\\'t occur in the hash tableof word probabilities.  I\\'ve found, again by trial anderror, that .4 is a good number to use.  If you\\'ve neverseen a word before, it is probably fairly innocent; spamwords tend to be all too familiar.There are examples of this algorithm being applied toactual emails in an appendix at the end.I treat mail as spam if the algorithm above gives it aprobability of more than .9 of being spam.  But in practiceit would not matter much where I put this threshold, becausefew probabilities end up in the middle of the range._ _ _One great advantage of the statistical approach is that youdon\\'t have to read so many spams.  Over the past six months,I\\'ve read literally thousands of spams, and it is reallykind of demoralizing.  Norbert Wiener said if you competewith slaves you become a slave, and there is somethingsimilarly degrading about competing with spammers.   Torecognize individual spam features you have to try to getinto the mind of the spammer, and frankly I want to spendas little time inside the minds of spammers as possible.But the real advantage of the Bayesian approach, of course,is that you know whatyou\\'re measuring.  Feature-recognizing filters likeSpamAssassin assign a spam \"score\" to email.  The Bayesianapproach assigns an actual probability.  The problem witha \"score\" is that no one knows what it means.  The userdoesn\\'t know what it means, but worse still, neither doesthe developer of the filter.  How manypointsshould anemail get for having the word \"sex\" in it?  A probabilitycan of course be mistaken, but there is little ambiguityabout what it means, or how evidence should be combinedto calculate it.  Based on my corpus, \"sex\" indicatesa .97 probability of the containing email being a spam,whereas \"sexy\" indicates .99 probability.And Bayes\\' Rule, equally unambiguous, says that an emailcontaining both words would, in the (unlikely)absence of any other evidence, have a 99.97% chance ofbeing a spam.Because it is measuring probabilities, the Bayesian approachconsiders all the evidence in the email, both good and bad.Words that occur disproportionatelyrarelyin spam (like \"though\" or \"tonight\" or \"apparently\")contribute as much to decreasing the probability asbad words like \"unsubscribe\" and \"opt-in\" do toincreasing it.  So an otherwise innocent email that happensto include the word \"sex\" is not going to get tagged as spam.Ideally, of course, the probabilities should be calculatedindividually for each user.  I get a lot of email containingthe word \"Lisp\", and (so far) no spam that does.  So a wordlike that is effectively a kind of password for sendingmail to me.  In my earlier spam-filtering software, the usercould set up a list of such words and mail containingthem would automatically get past the filters.  On mylist I put words like \"Lisp\" and also my zipcode, sothat (otherwise rather spammy-sounding) receipts fromonline orders would get through.  I thought I was beingvery clever, but I found that the Bayesian filter did thesame thing for me, and moreover discovered of a lot of words Ihadn\\'t thought of.When I said at the start that our filters let through less than5 spams per 1000 with 0 false positives, I\\'m talking aboutfiltering my mail based on a corpus of my mail.  But thesenumbers are not misleading, because that is the approach I\\'madvocating: filter each user\\'s mail based on the spam andnonspam mail he receives.  Essentially, each user shouldhave two delete buttons, ordinary delete and delete-as-spam.Anything deleted as spam goes into the spam corpus,   and everything else goes into the nonspam corpus.You could startusers with a seed filter, but ultimately each user should havehis own per-word probabilities based on the actual mail hereceives.  This (a) makes the filters more effective, (b) letseach user decide their own precise definition of spam,and (c) perhaps best of all makes it hard for spammersto tune mails to get through the filters.  If a lot of the  brain of the filter is in the individual databases, then merely tuning spams to get through the seed filterswon\\'t guarantee anything about how well they\\'ll get throughindividual users\\' varying and much more trained filters.Content-based spam filtering is often combined with a whitelist,a list of senders whose mail can be accepted with no filtering.One easy way to build such awhitelist is to keep a list of every address the user hasever sent mail to.  If a mail reader has a delete-as-spambutton then you could also add the from addressof every email the user has deleted as ordinary trash.I\\'m an advocate of whitelists, but more as a way to save  computation than as a way to improve filtering.  I used to think thatwhitelists would make filtering easier, because you\\'donly have to filter email from people you\\'d never heardfrom, and someone sending you mail for the first time isconstrained by convention in what they can say to you.Someone you already know might send you an email talking about sex,but someone sending you mail for the first time would not   be likely to.  The problem is, people can have more than one email address, so a new from-address doesn\\'t guarantee thatthe sender is writing to you for the first time.It is not unusualfor an old friend (especially if he is a hacker) to suddenlysend you an email with a new from-address, so you can\\'trisk false positives by filtering mail from unknown  addresses especially stringently.In a sense, though, my filters do themselves embody a kindof whitelist (and blacklist) because they are based onentire messages, including the headers.  So to thatextent they \"know\" the email addresses of trusted sendersand even the routes by which mail gets from them to me.   And they know the same about spam, including the server   names, mailer versions, and protocols._ _ _If I thought that I could keep up current rates of spamfiltering, I would consider this problem solved.  But itdoesn\\'t mean much to be able to filter out most present-dayspam, because spam evolves.Indeed, mostantispam techniquesso far have been like pesticides thatdo nothing more than create a new, resistant strain of bugs.I\\'m more hopeful about Bayesian filters, because they evolvewith the spam.  So as spammers start using \"c0ck\"   instead of \"cock\" to evade simple-minded spam filters     based on individual words, Bayesian filters automaticallynotice.  Indeed, \"c0ck\" is far more damning evidence than\"cock\", and Bayesian filters know precisely how much more.Still, anyone who proposes a plan for spam filtering has tobe able to answer the question: if the spammers knewexactly what you were doing,how well could they get past you?  For example, I think that ifchecksum-based spam filtering becomes a serious obstacle,the spammers will justswitch to mad-lib techniques for generating message bodies.To beat Bayesian filters, it would not be enough for spammersto make their emails unique or to stop using individualnaughty words.  They\\'d have to make their mails indistinguishablefrom your ordinary mail.  And this I think would severelyconstrain them.  Spam is mostly salespitches, so unless your regular mail is all sales pitches,spams will inevitably have a different character.  And    the spammers would also, of course, have to change (and keep changing) their whole infrastructure, because otherwisethe headers would look as bad to the Bayesian filters as ever,no matter what they did to the message body.  I don\\'t knowenough about the infrastructure that spammers use to knowhow hard it would be to make the headers look innocent, butmy guess is that it would be even harder than making the    message look innocent.Assuming they could solve the problem of the headers,the spam of the future will probably look something likethis:Hey there.  Thought you should check out the following:http://www.27meg.com/foobecause that is about as much sales pitch as content-basedfiltering will leave the spammer room to make.  (Indeed, itwill be hard even to get this past filters, because if everythingelse in the email is neutral, the spam probability will hinge onthe url, and it will take some effort to make that look neutral.)Spammers range from businesses running so-calledopt-in lists who don\\'t even try to conceal their identities,to guys who hijack mail servers to send out spams promotingporn sites.  If we use filtering to whittle theiroptions down to mails like the one above, that shouldpretty much put the spammers on the \"legitimate\" end ofthe spectrum out of business; they feel obligedby various state laws to include boilerplate about whytheir spam is not spam, and how to cancel your\"subscription,\"  and that kind of text is easy to   recognize.(I used to think it was naive to believe that stricter lawswould decrease spam.  Now I think that while stricter laws  may not decrease the amount of spam that spammerssend,they can certainly help filters to decrease the amount of  spam that recipients actually see.)All along the spectrum, if you restrict the sales pitches spammerscan make, you will inevitably tend to put them out ofbusiness.  That wordbusinessis an important one toremember.  The spammers are businessmen.  They send spam becauseit works.  It works because although the response rateis abominably low (at best 15 per million, vs 3000 permillion for a catalog mailing), the cost, to them, is  practically nothing.  The cost is enormous for the recipients,   about 5 man-weeks for each million recipients who spend  a second to delete the spam, but the spammerdoesn\\'t have to pay that.Sending spam does cost the spammer something, though. [2]So the lower we can get theresponse rate-- whether by filtering, or by using filters to forcespammers to dilute their pitches-- the fewer businesses will find itworth their while to send spam.The reason the spammers use the kinds ofsalespitchesthat they do is to increase response rates.This is possibly even more disgustingthan getting inside the mind of a spammer,but let\\'s take a quick look inside the mind of someonewhorespondsto a spam.  This person is eitherastonishingly credulous or deeply in denial about their   sexual interests.  In either case, repulsive oridiotic as the spam seems to us, it is excitingto them.  The spammers wouldn\\'t say these things if theydidn\\'t sound exciting.  And \"thought youshould check out the following\" is just not going tohave nearly the pull with the spam recipient asthe kinds of things that spammers say now.Result: if it can\\'t contain exciting sales pitches,spam becomes less effective as a marketing vehicle,and fewer businesses want to use it.That is the big win in the end.  I started writing spamfiltering software because I didn\\'t want have to look atthe stuff anymore.But if we get good enough at filteringout spam, it will stop working, and the spammerswill actually stop sending it._ _ _Of all the approaches to fighting spam, from software to laws,I believe Bayesian filtering will be the single mosteffective.  But I alsothink that the more different kinds of antispam effortswe undertake, the better, because any measure thatconstrains spammers will tend to make filtering easier.And even within the world of content-based filtering, I thinkit will be a good thing if there are many different kindsof software being used simultaneously.  The more different filters there are, the harder it will be forspammers to tune spams to get through them.Appendix: Examples of FilteringHereis an example of a spam that arrived while I was writingthis article.  The fifteen most interesting words in this spam are:qvp0045indiramx-05intimail$7500freeyankeedomcdobluefoxmediajpgunsecuredplatinum3d0qves7c57c266675The words are a mix of stuff from the headers and from themessage body, which is typical of spam.  Also typical of spamis that every one of these words has a spam probability,in my database, of .99.  In fact there are more than fifteen wordswith probabilities of .99, and these are just the firstfifteen seen.Unfortunately that makes this email a boring example ofthe use of Bayes\\' Rule.  To see an interesting variety ofprobabilities we have to look atthisactually quiteatypical spam.The fifteen most interesting words in this spam, with their probabilities,are:madam           0.99promotion       0.99republic        0.99shortest        0.047225013mandatory       0.047225013standardization 0.07347802sorry           0.08221981supported       0.09019077people\\'s        0.09019077enter           0.9075001quality         0.8921298organization    0.12454646investment      0.8568143very            0.14758544valuable        0.82347786This time the evidence is a mix of good and bad.  A word like  \"shortest\" is almost as much evidence for innocence as aword like \"madam\" or \"promotion\" is for guilt.  But still thecase for guilt is stronger.  If you combine these numbersaccording to Bayes\\' Rule, the resulting probability is .9027.\"Madam\" is obviously from spams beginning\"Dear Sir or Madam.\"  They\\'re not very common, but theword \"madam\"neveroccurs in my legitimate email, andit\\'s all about the ratio.\"Republic\" scores high becauseit often shows up in Nigerian scam emails, and also occurs onceor twice in spams referring to Korea and South Africa.You might say that it\\'san accident that it thus helps identify this spam.  But I\\'vefound when examining spam probabilities that there area lot of these accidents, and they have an uncanny tendency topush things in the right direction rather than the wrong one.In this case, it is not entirely a coincidence that the word\"Republic\" occurs in Nigerian scam emails and this spam.There is a whole class of dubious business propositions involvingless developed countries, and these in turn are more likelyto have names that specify explicitly (because they aren\\'t) that theyare republics.[3]On the other hand, \"enter\" is a genuine miss.  It occursmostly in unsubscribe instructions, but here is used in acompletely innocent way.  Fortunately the statistical approach isfairly robust, and can tolerate quite a lot of missesbefore the results start to be thrown off.For comparison,hereis an example of that rare bird, a spam thatgets through the filters.  Why?  Because by sheer chance it happensto be loaded with words that occur in my actual email:perl       0.01python     0.01tcl        0.01scripting  0.01morris     0.01graham     0.01491078guarantee  0.9762507cgi        0.9734398paul       0.027040077quite      0.030676773pop3       0.042199217various    0.06080265prices     0.9359873managed    0.06451222difficult  0.071706355There are a couple pieces of good news here.  First, this mailprobably wouldn\\'t get through the filters of someone who didn\\'thappen to specialize in programming languages and have a goodfriend called Morris.  For the average user, all the top five words here would be neutral and would not contribute to the spam probability.Second, I think filtering based on word pairs (see below) might wellcatch this one:  \"cost effective\", \"setup fee\", \"money back\" -- prettyincriminating stuff.  And of course if they continued to spam me(or a network I was part of), \"Hostex\" itself would berecognized as  a spam term.Finally,hereis an innocent email.Its  fifteen most interesting words are as follows:continuation  0.01describe      0.01continuations 0.01example       0.033600237programming   0.05214485 i\\'m           0.055427782examples      0.07972858 color         0.9189189  localhost     0.09883721hi            0.116539136california    0.84421706same          0.15981844spot          0.1654587us-ascii      0.16804294what          0.19212411Most of the words here indicate the mail is an innocent one.There are two bad smelling words,  \"color\"(spammers love colored fonts) and \"California\"(which occurs in testimonials and also in menus informs), but they are not enough to outweigh obviouslyinnocent words like \"continuation\" and \"example\".It\\'s interesting that \"describe\" rates as so thoroughlyinnocent.  It hasn\\'t occurred in asingle one of my 4000 spams.  The data turns out to befull of such surprises.  One of the things you learnwhen you analyze spam texts is hownarrow a subset of the language spammers operate in.  It\\'sthat fact, together with the equally characteristic vocabularyof any individual user\\'s mail, that makes Bayesian filteringa good bet.Appendix: More IdeasOne idea that I haven\\'t tried yet is to filter based onword pairs, or even triples, rather than individual words.This should yield a much sharper estimate of the probability.For example, in my current database, the word \"offers\"has a probability of .96.  If you based the probabilities  on word pairs, you\\'d end up with \"special offers\"and \"valuable offers\" having probabilities of .99and, say, \"approach offers\" (as in \"this approach offers\")having a probability of .1 or less.The reason I haven\\'t done this is that filtering based onindividual words already works so well.  But it doesmean that there is room to tighten the filters if spamgets harder to detect.(Curiously, a filter based on word pairs would bein effect a Markov-chaining text generator runningin reverse.)Specific spam features (e.g. not seeing the recipient\\'saddress in the to: field) do of course have value in recognizing spam.  They can be considered in thisalgorithm by treating them as virtual words.  I\\'ll probablydo this in future versions, at least for a handful of themost egregious spam indicators. Feature-recognizingspam filters are right in many details; what they lackis an overall discipline for combining evidence.Recognizing nonspam features may be more important thanrecognizing spam features.  False positives are such aworry that they demand extraordinary measures.  I willprobably in future versions add a second level of testingdesigned specifically to avoid false positives.  If amail triggers this second level of filters it will be acceptedeven if its spam probability is above the threshold.I don\\'t expect this second level of filtering to be Bayesian.It will inevitably be not only ad hoc, but based on guesses, because the number offalse positives will not tend to be large enough to notice patterns.(It is just as well, anyway, if a backup system doesn\\'t rely on the sametechnology as the primary system.)Another thing I may try in the future is to focus extra attentionon specific parts of the email.  For example, about 95% of currentspam includes the url of a site they wantyou to visit.  (The remaining 5% want you to call a phone number,reply by email or to a US mail address, or in a fewcases to buy a certain stock.)   The url is in such casespractically enough by itself to determine whether the emailis spam.Domain names differ from the rest of the text ina (non-German) email in that they often consist of severalwords stuck together.  Though computationally expensive in the general case, it might be worth trying to decompose them.  If a filter has never seen thetoken \"xxxporn\" before it will have an individual spamprobability of .4, whereas \"xxx\" and \"porn\" individuallyhave probabilities (in my corpus) of .9889 and .99respectively, and a combined probability of .9998.I expect decomposing domain names to become moreimportant as spammers are gradually forced to stop usingincriminating words in the text of their messages.  (A urlwith an ip address is of course an extremely incriminating sign,except in the mail of a few sysadmins.)It might be a good idea to have a cooperatively maintainedlist of urls promoted by spammers.  We\\'d need a trust metricof the type studied by Raph Levien to prevent maliciousor incompetent submissions, but if we had such a thing itwould provide a boost to any filtering software.   It wouldalso be a convenient basis for boycotts.Another way to test dubious urls would be to send out acrawler to look at the site before the user looked at theemail mentioning it.  You could use a Bayesian filter torate the site just as you would an email, and whateverwas found on the site could be included in calculatingthe probability of the email being a spam.  A url that ledto a redirect would of course be especially suspicious.One cooperative project that I think really would be a goodidea would be to accumulate a giant corpus of spam.  A large,clean corpus is the key to making Bayesian filtering workwell.  Bayesian filters could actually use the corpus asinput.  But such a corpus would be useful for other kindsof filters too, because it could be used to test them.Creating such a corpus poses some technical problems.  We\\'dneed trust metrics to prevent malicious or incompetentsubmissions, of course.  We\\'d also need ways of erasing   personal information (not just to-addresses and ccs, butalso e.g. the arguments to unsubscribe urls, which oftenencode the to-address) from mails in the corpus.  If anyonewants to take on this project, it would be a good thing forthe world.Appendix: Defining SpamI think there is a roughconsensus on what spam is, but it would be useful to havean explicit definition.  We\\'ll need to do this if we want to establisha central corpus of spam, or even to compare spam filteringrates meaningfully.To start with, spam is not unsolicited commercial email.If someone in my neighborhood heard that I was looking for an oldRaleigh three-speed in good condition, and sent me an emailoffering to sell me one, I\\'d be delighted, and yet thisemail would be both commercial and unsolicited.  Thedefining feature of spam (in fact, itsraison d\\'etre)is not that it is unsolicited, but that it is automated.It is merely incidental, too, that spam is usually commercial.If someone started sending mass email to support some politicalcause, for example, it would be just as much spam as emailpromoting a porn site.I propose we define spam asunsolicited automated email.This definition thus includes some emailthat many legal definitions of spam don\\'t.  Legal definitionsof spam, influenced presumably by lobbyists, tend to excludemail sent by companies that have an \"existing relationship\" withthe recipient.  But buying something from a company, forexample, does not imply that you have solicitedongoing email from them.If I order something from an onlinestore, and they then send me a stream of spam, it\\'s stillspam.Companies sending spam often give you a way to \"unsubscribe,\"or ask you to go to their site and change your \"accountpreferences\" if you want to stop getting spam.  This isnot enough to stop the mail from being spam.  Not opting outis not the same as opting in.  Unless the   recipient explicitly checked a clearly labelled box (whosedefault was no) asking to receive the email, then it is spam.In some business relationships, you do implicitly solicitcertain kinds of mail.   When you order online, I think youimplicitly solicit a receipt, and notification when theorder ships.I don\\'t mind when Verisign sends me mail warning thata domain name is about to expire (at least, if they are theactual registrarfor it).  But when Verisign sends meemail offering a FREE Guide to Building MyE-Commerce Web Site, that\\'s spam.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'An investor wants to give you money for a certain percentage ofyour startup.  Should you take it?  You\\'re about to hire your firstemployee.  How much stock should you give him?These are some of the hardest questions founders face.  And yetboth have the same answer:1/(1 - n)Whenever you\\'re trading stock in your company for anything, whetherit\\'s money or an employee or a deal with another company, the testfor whether to do it is the same.  You should give up n% of yourcompany if what you trade it for improves your average outcomeenough that the (100 - n)% you have left is worth more than thewhole company was before.For example, if an investor wants to buy half your company, howmuch does that investment have to improve your average outcome foryou to break even?  Obviously it has to double: if you trade halfyour company for something that more than doubles the company\\'saverage outcome, you\\'re net ahead.  You have half as big a shareof something worth more than twice as much.In the general case, if n is the fraction of the company you\\'regiving up, the deal is a good one if it makes the company worthmore than 1/(1 - n).For example, suppose Y Combinator offers to fund you in return for7% of your company.  In this case, n is .07 and 1/(1 - n) is 1.075.So you should take the deal if you believe we can improve youraverage outcome by more than 7.5%.  If we improve your outcome by10%, you\\'re net ahead, because the remaining .93 you hold is worth.93 x 1.1 = 1.023.One of the things the equity equation shows us is that, financiallyat least, taking money from a top VC firm can be a really good deal.Greg Mcadoo from Sequoia recently said at a YC dinner that whenSequoia invests alone they like to take about 30% of a company.1/.7 = 1.43, meaning that deal is worth taking if they can improveyour outcome by more than 43%.  For the average startup, that wouldbe an extraordinary bargain.  It would improve the average startup\\'sprospects by more than 43% just to be able tosaythey were fundedby Sequoia, even if they never actually got the money.The reason Sequoia is such a good deal is that the percentage ofthe company they take is artificially low.  They don\\'t even try toget market price for their investment; they limit their holdingsto leave the founders enough stock to feel the company is stilltheirs.The catch is that Sequoia gets about 6000 business plans a year andfunds about 20 of them, so the odds of getting this great deal are1 in 300. The companies that make it through are not average startups.Of course, there are other factors to consider in a VC deal.  It\\'snever just a straight trade of money for stock.  But if it were,taking money from a top firm would generally be a bargain.You can use the same formula when giving stock to employees, butit works in the other direction.  If i is the average outcome forthe company with the addition of some new person, then they\\'re worthn such that i = 1/(1 - n).  Which means n = (i - 1)/i.For example, suppose you\\'re just two founders and you want to hirean additional hacker who\\'s so good you feel he\\'ll increase theaverage outcome of the whole company by 20%.  n = (1.2 - 1)/1.2 =.167.  So you\\'ll break even if you trade 16.7% of the companyfor him.That doesn\\'t mean 16.7% is the right amount of stock to give him.Stock is not the only cost of hiring someone: there\\'s usually salaryand overhead as well.  And if the company merely breaks even on thedeal, there\\'s no reason to do it.I think to translate salary and overhead into stock you shouldmultiply the annual rate by about 1.5.  Most startups grow fast ordie; if you die you don\\'t have to pay the guy, and if you grow fastyou\\'ll be paying next year\\'s salary out of next year\\'s valuation,which should be 3x this year\\'s.  If your valuation grows 3x a year,the total cost in stock of a new hire\\'s salary and overhead is 1.5years\\' cost at the present valuation.How much of an additional margin should the company need as the\"activation energy\" for the deal?  Since this is in effect thecompany\\'s profit on a hire, the market will determine that: ifyou\\'re a hot opportunity, you can charge more.Let\\'s run through an example.  Suppose the company wants to make a\"profit\" of 50% on the new hire mentioned above.  So subtract athird from 16.7% and we have 11.1% as his \"retail\" price.  Supposefurther that he\\'s going to cost $60k a year in salary and overhead,x 1.5 = $90k total.  If the company\\'s valuation is $2 million, $90kis 4.5%.  11.1% - 4.5% = an offer of 6.6%.Incidentally, notice how important it is for early employees totake little salary.  It comes right out of stock that could otherwisebe given to them.Obviously there is a great deal of play in these numbers.  I\\'m notclaiming that stock grants can now be reduced to a formula.  Ultimatelyyou always have to guess.  But at least know what you\\'re guessing.If you choose a number based on your gut feel, or a table of typicalgrant sizes supplied by a VC firm, understand what those are estimatesof.And more generally, when you make any decision involving equity,run it through 1/(1 - n) to see if it makes sense.  You shouldalways feel richer after trading equity.  If the trade didn\\'tincrease the value of your remaining shares enough to put you netahead, you wouldn\\'t have (or shouldn\\'t have) done it.'},\n",

Many are underfunded.  A few areoverfunded, which is like trying to start driving in third gear.I think it would help founders to understand funding better—notjust the mechanics of it, but what investors are thinking.

They were helpful in negotiating deals, for example.

And if trouble withinvestors is one of the biggest threats to a startup, managing themis one of the most important skills founders need to learn.Let\\'s start by talking about the five sources of startup funding.Then we\\'ll trace the life of a hypothetical (very fortunate) startupas it shifts gears through successive rounds.Friends and FamilyA lot of startups get their first funding from friends and family.Excite did, for example: after the founders graduated from college,they borrowed $15,000 from their parents to start a company.  Withthe help of some part-time jobs they made it last 18 months.If your friends or family happen to be rich, the line blurs betweenthem and angel investors.  At Viaweb we got our first $10,000 ofseed money from our friend Julian, but he was sufficiently richthat it\\'s hard to say whether he should be classified as a friendor angel.  He was also a lawyer, which was great, because it meantwe didn\\'t have to pay legal bills out of that initial small sum.The advantage of raising money from friends and family is thatthey\\'re easy to find.  You already know them.  There are three maindisadvantages: you mix together your business and personal life;they will probably not be as well connected as angels or venturefirms; and they may not be accredited investors, which couldcomplicate your life later.The SEC defines an \"accredited investor\" as someone with over amillion dollars in liquid assets or an income of over $200,000 ayear.  The regulatory burden is much lower if a company\\'s shareholdersare all accredited investors.  Once you take money from the generalpublic you\\'re more restricted in what you can do.A startup\\'s life will be more complicated, legally, if any of theinvestors aren\\'t accredited.  In an IPO, it might not merely addexpense, but change the outcome. A lawyer I asked about it said:When the company goes public, the SEC will carefully study all  prior issuances of stock by the company and demand that it take  immediate action to cure any past violations of securities laws.  Those remedial actions can delay, stall or even kill the IPO.Of course the odds of any given startup doing an IPO are small.But not as small as they might seem. A lot of startups that end upgoing public didn\\'t seem likely to at first. (Who could have guessedthat the company Wozniak and Jobs started in their spare time sellingplans for microcomputers would yield one of the biggest IPOs of thedecade?) Much of the value of a startup consists of that tinyprobability multiplied by the huge outcome.It wasn\\'t because they weren\\'t accredited investors that I didn\\'task my parents for seed money, though.  When we were starting Viaweb,I didn\\'t know about the concept of an accredited investor, anddidn\\'t stop to think about the value of investors\\' connections.The reason I didn\\'t take money from my parents was that I didn\\'twant them to lose it.ConsultingAnother way to fund a startup is to get a job.  The best sort ofjob is a consulting project in which you can build whatever softwareyou wanted to sell as a startup.  Then you can gradually transformyourself from a consulting company into a product company, and haveyour clients pay your development expenses.This is a good plan for someone with kids, because it takes mostof the risk out of starting a startup.  There never has to be atime when you have no revenues.  Risk and reward are usuallyproportionate, however: you should expect a plan that cuts the riskof starting a startup also to cut the average return.  In this case,you trade decreased financial risk for increased risk that yourcompany won\\'t succeed as a startup.But isn\\'t the consulting company itself a startup?  No, not generally.A company has to be more than small and newly founded to be astartup.  There are millions of small businesses in America, butonly a few thousand are startups.  To be a startup, a company hasto be a product business, not a service business.  By which I meannot that it has to make something physical, but that it has to haveone thing it sells to many people, rather than doing custom workfor individual clients.  Custom work doesn\\'t scale.  To be a startupyou need to be the band that sells a million copies of a song, notthe band that makes money by playing at individual weddings and barmitzvahs.The trouble with consulting is that clients have an awkward habitof calling you on the phone.  Most startups operate close to themargin of failure, and the distraction of having to deal with clientscould be enough to put you over the edge.  Especially if you havecompetitors who get to work full time on just being a startup.So you have to be very disciplined if you take the consulting route.You have to work actively to prevent your company growing into a\"weed tree,\" dependent on this source of easy but low-margin money.Indeed, the biggest danger of consulting may be that it gives youan excuse for failure.  In a startup, as in grad school, a lot ofwhat ends up driving you are the expectations of your family andfriends.  Once you start a startup and tell everyone that\\'s whatyou\\'re doing, you\\'re now on a path labelled \"get rich or bust.\" Younow have to get rich, or you\\'ve failed.Fear of failure is an extraordinarily powerful force.  Usually itprevents people from starting things, but once you publish somedefinite ambition, it switches directions and starts working inyour favor.  I think it\\'s a pretty clever piece of jiujitsu to setthis irresistible force against the slightly less immovable objectof becoming rich.  You won\\'t have it driving you if your statedambition is merely to start a consulting company that you will oneday morph into a startup.An advantage of consulting, as a way to develop a product, is thatyou know you\\'re making something at least one customer wants.  Butif you have what it takes to start a startup you should havesufficient vision not to need this crutch.Angel InvestorsAngelsare individual rich people.  The word was first usedfor backers of Broadway plays, but now applies to individual investorsgenerally.  Angels who\\'ve made money in technology are preferable,for two reasons: they understand your situation, and they\\'re asource of contacts and advice.The contacts and advice can be more important than the money.  Whendel.icio.us took money from investors, they took money from, amongothers, Tim O\\'Reilly.  The amount he put in was small compared tothe VCs who led the round, but Tim is a smart and influential guyand it\\'s good to have him on your side.You can do whatever you want with money from consulting or friendsand family.  With angels we\\'re now talking about venture fundingproper, so it\\'s time to introduce the concept ofexit strategy.Younger would-be founders are often surprised that investors expectthem either to sell the company or go public.  The reason is thatinvestors need to get their capital back.  They\\'ll only considercompanies that have an exit strategy—meaning companies that couldget bought or go public.This is not as selfish as it sounds.  There are few large, privatetechnology companies.  Those that don\\'t fail all seem to get boughtor go public.  The reason is that employees are investors too—oftheir time—and they want just as much to be able to cash out.  Ifyour competitors offer employees stock options that might make themrich, while you make it clear you plan to stay private, yourcompetitors will get the best people. So the principle of an \"exit\"is not just something forced on startups by investors, but part ofwhat it means to be a startup.Another concept we need to introduce now is valuation.  When someonebuys shares in a company, that implicitly establishes a value forit.  If someone pays $20,000 for 10% of a company, the company isin theory worth $200,000.  I say \"in theory\" because in early stageinvesting, valuations are voodoo.  As a company gets more established,its valuation gets closer to an actual market value.  But in a newlyfounded startup, the valuation number is just an artifact of therespective contributions of everyone involved.Startups often \"pay\" investors who will help the company in someway by letting them invest at low valuations.  If I had a startupand Steve Jobs wanted to invest in it, I\\'d give him the stock for$10, just to be able to brag that he was an investor.  Unfortunately,it\\'s impractical (if not illegal) to adjust the valuation of thecompany up and down for each investor.  Startups\\' valuations aresupposed to rise over time.  So if you\\'re going to sell cheap stockto eminent angels, do it early, when it\\'s natural for the companyto have a low valuation.Some angel investors join together in syndicates.  Any city wherepeople start startups will have one or more of them.  In Boston thebiggest is theCommonAngels.  In the Bay Area it\\'s theBandof Angels.  You can find groups near you through theAngel Capital Association.However, most angel investors don\\'t belong to these groups.  Infact, the more prominent the angel, the less likely they are tobelong to a group.Some angel groups charge you money to pitch your idea to them.Needless to say, you should never do this.One of the dangers of taking investment from individual angels,rather than through an angel group or investment firm, is that theyhave less reputation to protect.  A big-name VC firm will not screwyou too outrageously, because other founders would avoid them ifword got out.  With individual angels you don\\'t have this protection,as we found to our dismay in our own startup.  In many startups\\'lives there comes a point when you\\'re at the investors\\' mercy—when you\\'re out of money and the only place to get more is yourexisting investors.  When we got into such a scrape, our investorstook advantage of it in a way that a name-brand VC probably wouldn\\'thave.Angels have a corresponding advantage, however: they\\'re also notbound by all the rules that VC firms are.  And so they can, forexample, allow founders to cash out partially in a funding round,by selling some of their stock directly to the investors.  I thinkthis will become more common; the average founder is eager to doit, and selling, say, half a million dollars worth of stock willnot, as VCs fear, cause most founders to be any less committed tothe business.The same angels who tried to screw us also let us do this, and soon balance I\\'m grateful rather than angry.  (As in families, relationsbetween founders and investors can be complicated.)The best way to find angel investors is through personal introductions.You could try to cold-call angel groups near you, but angels, likeVCs, will pay more attention to deals recommended by someone theyrespect.Deal terms with angels vary a lot.  There are no generally acceptedstandards.  Sometimes angels\\' deal terms are as fearsome as VCs\\'.Other angels, particularly in the earliest stages, will invest basedon a two-page agreement.Angels who only invest occasionally may not themselves know whatterms they want.  They just want to invest in this startup.  Whatkind of anti-dilution protection do they want?  Hell if they know.In these situations, the deal terms tend to be random: the angelasks his lawyer to create a vanilla agreement, and the terms endup being whatever the lawyer considers vanilla.  Which in practiceusually means, whatever existing agreement he finds lying aroundhis firm.  (Few legal documents are created from scratch.)These heaps o\\' boilerplate are a problem for small startups, becausethey tend to grow into the union of all preceding documents.  Iknow of one startup that got from an angel investor what amountedto a five hundred pound handshake: after deciding to invest, theangel presented them with a 70-page agreement.  The startup didn\\'thave enough money to pay a lawyer even to read it, let alone negotiatethe terms, so the deal fell through.One solution to this problem would be to have the startup\\'s lawyerproduce the agreement, instead of the angel\\'s.  Some angels mightbalk at this, but others would probably welcome it.Inexperienced angels often get cold feet when the time comes towrite that big check.  In our startup, one of the two angels in theinitial round took months to pay us, and only did after repeatednagging from our lawyer, who was also, fortunately, his lawyer.It\\'s obvious why investors delay.  Investing in startups is risky!When a company is only two months old, everydayyou waitgives you 1.7% more data about their trajectory.  But the investoris already being compensated for that risk in the low price of thestock, so it is unfair to delay.Fair or not, investors do it if you let them.  Even VCs do it.  Andfunding delays are a big distraction for founders, who ought to beworking on their company, not worrying about investors.  What\\'s astartup to do?  With both investors and acquirers, the only leverageyou have is competition.  If an investor knows you have otherinvestors lined up, he\\'ll be a lot more eager to close-- and notjust because he\\'ll worry about losing the deal, but because if otherinvestors are interested, you must be worth investing in.  It\\'s thesame with acquisitions.  No one wants to buy you till someone elsewants to buy you, and then everyone wants to buy you.The key to closing deals is never to stop pursuing alternatives.When an investor says he wants to invest in you, or an acquirersays they want to buy you,don\\'t believe it till you get thecheck.Your natural tendency when an investor says yes willbe to relax and go back to writing code.  Alas, you can\\'t; you haveto keep looking for more investors, if only to get this one to act.Seed Funding FirmsSeed firms are like angels in that they invest relatively smallamounts at early stages, but like VCs in that they\\'re companiesthat do it as a business, rather than individuals making occasionalinvestments on the side.Till now, nearly all seed firms have been so-called \"incubators,\"soY Combinatorgets calledone too, though the only thing we have in common is that we investin the earliest phase.According to the National Association of Business Incubators, thereare about 800 incubators in the US.  This is an astounding number,because I know the founders of a lot of startups, and I can\\'t thinkof one that began in an incubator.What is an incubator?  I\\'m not sure myself.  The defining qualityseems to be that you work in their space.  That\\'s where the name\"incubator\" comes from.  They seem to vary a great deal in otherrespects.  At one extreme is the sort of pork-barrel project wherea town gets money from the state government to renovate a vacantbuilding as a \"high-tech incubator,\" as if it were merely lack ofthe right sort of office space that had till now prevented the townfrom becoming astartup hub.  At the other extreme are places likeIdealab, which generates ideas for new startups internally and hirespeople to work for them.The classic Bubble incubators, most of which now seem to be dead,were like VC firms except that they took a much bigger role in thestartups they funded.  In addition to working in their space, youwere supposed to use their office staff, lawyers, accountants, andso on.Whereas incubators tend (or tended) to exert more control than VCs,Y Combinator exerts less.And we think it\\'s better if startups operate out of their ownpremises, however crappy, than the offices of their investors.  Soit\\'s annoying that we keep getting called an \"incubator,\" but perhapsinevitable, because there\\'s only one of us so far and no word yetfor what we are.  If we have to be called something, the obviousname would be \"excubator.\" (The name is more excusable if oneconsiders it as meaning that we enable people to escape cubicles.)Because seed firms are companies rather than individual people,reaching them is easier than reaching angels.  Just go to their website and send them an email.  The importance of personal introductionsvaries, but is less than with angels or VCs.The fact that seed firms are companies also means the investmentprocess is more standardized.  (This is generally true with angelgroups too.) Seed firms will probably have set deal terms they usefor every startup they fund.  The fact that the deal terms arestandard doesn\\'t mean they\\'re favorable to you, but if other startupshave signed the same agreements and things went well for them, it\\'sa sign the terms are reasonable.Seed firms differ from angels and VCs in that they invest exclusivelyin the earliest phases—often when the company is still just anidea.  Angels and even VC firms occasionally do this, but they alsoinvest at later stages.The problems are different in the early stages.  For example, inthe first couple months a startup may completely redefine theiridea.  So seed investors usually care lessabout the idea than the people. This is true of all venture funding,but especially so in the seed stage.Like VCs, one of the advantages of seed firms is the advice theyoffer.  But because seed firms operate in an earlier phase, theyneed to offer different kinds of advice.  For example, a seed firmshould be able to give advice about how to approach VCs, which VCsobviously don\\'t need to do; whereas VCs should be able to giveadvice about how to hire an \"executive team,\" which is not an issuein the seed stage.In the earliest phases, a lot of the problems are technical, soseed firms should be able to help with technical as well as businessproblems.Seed firms and angel investors generally want to invest in theinitial phases of a startup, then hand them off to VC firms for thenext round.  Occasionally startups go from seed funding direct toacquisition, however, and I expect this to become increasinglycommon.Google has been aggressively pursuing this route, and nowYahoois too.  Bothnow compete directly with VCs.  And this is a smart move.  Why waitfor further funding rounds to jack up a startup\\'s price?  When astartup reaches the point where VCs have enough information toinvest in it, the acquirer should have enough information to buyit.  More information, in fact; with their technical depth, theacquirers should be better at picking winners than VCs.Venture Capital FundsVC firms are like seed firms in that they\\'re actual companies, butthey invest other people\\'s money, and much larger amounts of it.VC investments average several million dollars.  So they tend tocome later in the life of a startup, are harder to get, and comewith tougher terms.The word \"venture capitalist\" is sometimes used loosely for anyventure investor, but there is a sharp difference between VCs andother investors: VC firms are organized asfunds, much likehedge funds or mutual funds.  The fund managers, who are called\"general partners,\" get about 2% of the fund annually as a managementfee, plus about 20% of the fund\\'s gains.There is a very sharp dropoff in performance among VC firms, becausein the VC business both success and failure are self-perpetuating.When an investment scores spectacularly, as Google did for Kleinerand Sequoia, it generates a lot of good publicity for the VCs.  Andmany founders prefer to take money from successful VC firms, becauseof the legitimacy it confers.  Hence a vicious (for the losers)cycle:  VC firms that have been doing badly will only get the dealsthe bigger fish have rejected, causing them to continue to do badly.As a result, of the thousand or so VC funds in the US now, onlyabout 50 are likely to make money, and it is very hard for a newfund to break into this group.In a sense, the lower-tier VC firms are a bargain for founders.They may not be quite as smart or as well connected as the big-namefirms, but they are much hungrier for deals.  This means you shouldbe able to get better terms from them.Better how?  The most obvious is valuation: they\\'ll take less ofyour company.  But as well as money, there\\'s power.  I think founderswill increasingly be able to stay on as CEO, and on terms that willmake it fairly hard to fire them later.The most dramatic change, I predict,is that VCs will allow founders to cash out partially bysellingsome of their stock direct to the VC firm.  VCs have traditionallyresisted letting founders get anything before the ultimate \"liquidityevent.\"  But they\\'re also desperate for deals.  And since I knowfrom my own experience that the rule against buying stock fromfounders is a stupid one, this is a natural place for things togive as venture funding becomes more and more a seller\\'s market.The disadvantage of taking money from less known firms is thatpeople will assume, correctly or not, that you were turned down bythe more exalted ones.  But, like where you went to college, thename of your VC stops mattering once you have some performance tomeasure.  So the more confident you are, the less you need abrand-name VC.  We funded Viaweb entirely with angel money; it neveroccurred to us that the backing of a well known VC firm would makeus seem more impressive.Another danger of less known firms is that, like angels, they haveless reputation to protect.   I suspect it\\'s the lower-tier firmsthat are responsible for most of the tricks that have given VCssuch a bad reputation among hackers.  They are doubly hosed: thegeneral partners themselves are less able, and yet they have harderproblems to solve, because the top VCs skim off all the best deals,leaving the lower-tier firms exactly the startups that are likelyto blow up.For example, lower-tier firms are much more likely to pretend towant to do a deal with you just to lock you up while they decideif they really want to.  One experienced CFO said:The better ones usually will not give a term sheet unless they really want to do a deal. The second or third tier firms have a much higher break rate—it could be as high as 50%.It\\'s obvious why: the lower-tier firms\\' biggest fear, when chancethrows them a bone, is that one of the big dogs will notice andtake it away.  The big dogs don\\'t have to worry about that.Falling victim to this trick could really hurt you.  As oneVC told me:If you were talking to four VCs, told three of them that you  accepted a term sheet, and then have to call them back to tell  them you were just kidding, you are absolutely damaged goods.Here\\'s a partial solution: when a VC offers you a term sheet, askhow many of their last 10 term sheets turned into deals.  This willat least force them to lie outright if they want to mislead you.Not all the people who work at VC firms are partners.  Most firmsalso have a handful of junior employees called something likeassociates or analysts.  If you get a call from a VCfirm, go to their web site and check whether the person you talkedto is a partner.  Odds are it will be a junior person; they scourthe web looking for startups their bosses could invest in.  Thejunior people will tend to seem very positive about your company.They\\'re not pretending; theywantto believe you\\'re a hotprospect, because it would be a huge coup for them if their firminvested in a company they discovered.  Don\\'t be misled by thisoptimism.  It\\'s the partners who decide, and they view things witha colder eye.Because VCs invest large amounts, the money comes with morerestrictions.  Most only come into effect if the company gets intotrouble.  For example, VCs generally write it into the deal thatin any sale, they get their investment back first.  So if the companygets sold at a low price, the founders could get nothing.  Some VCsnow require that in any sale they get 4x their investment backbefore the common stock holders (that is, you) get anything, butthis is an abuse that should be resisted.Another difference with large investments is that the founders areusually required to accept \"vesting\"—to surrender their stock andearn it back over the next 4-5 years.  VCs don\\'t want to investmillions in a company the founders could just walk away from.Financially, vesting has little effect, but in some situations itcould mean founders will have less power.  If VCs got de factocontrol of the company and fired one of the founders, he\\'d lose anyunvested stock unless there was specific protection against this.So vesting would in that situation force founders to toe the line.The most noticeable change when a startup takes serious funding isthat the founders will no longer have complete control.  Ten yearsago VCs used to insist that founders step down as CEO and hand thejob over to a business guy they supplied.  This is less the rulenow, partly because the disasters of the Bubble showed that genericbusiness guys don\\'t make such great CEOs.But while founders will increasingly be able to stay on as CEO,they\\'ll have to cede some power, because the board of directorswill become more powerful.  In the seed stage, the board is generallya formality; if you want to talk to the other board members, youjust yell into the next room.  This stops with VC-scale money.  Ina typical VC funding deal, the board of directors might be composedof two VCs, two founders, and one outside person acceptable to both.The board will have ultimate power, which means the founders nowhave to convince instead of commanding.This is not as bad as it sounds, however.  Bill Gates is in thesame position; he doesn\\'t have majority control of Microsoft; inprinciple he also has to convince instead of commanding.  And yethe seems pretty commanding, doesn\\'t he?  As long as things are goingsmoothly, boards don\\'t interfere much.  The danger comes when there\\'sa bump in the road, as happened to Steve Jobs at Apple.Like angels, VCs prefer to invest in deals that come to them throughpeople they know.  So while nearly all VC funds have some addressyou can send your business plan to, VCs privately admit the chanceof getting funding by this route is near zero.  One recently toldme that he did not know a single startup that got funded this way.I suspect VCs accept business plans \"over the transom\" more as away to keep tabs on industry trends than as a source of deals.  Infact, I would strongly advise against mailing your business planrandomly to VCs, because they treat this as evidence of laziness.Do the extra work of getting personal introductions.  As one VC putit:I\\'m not hard to find.  I know a lot of people.  If you can\\'t find  some way to reach me, how are you going to create a successful  company?One of the most difficult problems for startup founders is decidingwhen to approach VCs. You really only get one chance, because theyrely heavily on first impressions.  And you can\\'t approach some andsave others for later, because (a) they ask who else you\\'ve talkedto and when and (b) they talk among themselves.  If you\\'re talkingto one VC and he finds out that you were rejected by another severalmonths ago, you\\'ll definitely seem shopworn.So when do you approach VCs?  When you can convince them.  If thefounders have impressive resumes and the idea isn\\'t hard to understand,you could approach VCs quite early.  Whereas if the founders areunknown and the idea is very novel, you might have to launch thething and show that users loved it before VCs would be convinced.If several VCs are interested in you, they will sometimes be willingto split the deal between them.  They\\'re more likely to do this ifthey\\'re close in the VC pecking order.  Such deals may be a net winfor founders, because you get multiple VCs interested in yoursuccess, and you can ask each for advice about the other.  Onefounder I know wrote:Two-firm deals are great. It costs you a little more equity, but  being able to play the two firms off each other (as well as ask  one if the other is being out of line) is invaluable.When you do negotiate with VCs, remember that they\\'ve done this alot more than you have.  They\\'ve invested in dozens of startups,whereas this is probably the first you\\'ve founded.  But don\\'t letthem or the situation intimidate you. The average founder is smarterthan the average VC.  So just do what you\\'d do in any complex,unfamiliar situation: proceed deliberately, and question anythingthat seems odd.It is, unfortunately, common for VCs to put terms in an agreementwhose consequences surprise founders later, and also common for VCsto defend things they do by saying that they\\'re standard in theindustry.  Standard, schmandard; the whole industry is only a fewdecades old, and rapidly evolving.  The concept of \"standard\" is auseful one when you\\'re operating on a small scale (Y Combinatoruses identical terms for every deal because for tiny seed-stageinvestments it\\'s not worth the overhead of negotiating individualdeals), but it doesn\\'t apply at the VC level.  On that scale, everynegotiation is unique.Most successful startups get money from more than one of the precedingfive sources.And, confusingly, the names of funding sourcesalso tend to be used as the names of different rounds.  The bestway to explain how it all works is to follow the case of a hypotheticalstartup.Stage 1: Seed RoundOur startup begins when a group of three friends have an idea--either an idea for something they might build, or simply the idea\"let\\'s start a company.\"  Presumably they already have some sourceof food and shelter.  But if you have food and shelter, you probablyalso have something you\\'re supposed to be working on: eitherclasswork, or a job.  So if you want to work full-time on a startup,your money situation will probably change too.A lot of startup founders say they started the company without anyidea of what they planned to do.  This is actually less common thanit seems: many have to claim they thought of the idea after quittingbecause otherwise their former employer would own it.The three friends decide to take the leap.  Since most startups arein competitive businesses, you not only want to work full-time onthem, but more than full-time.  So some or all of the friends quittheir jobs or leave school.  (Some of the founders in a startup canstay in grad school, but at least one has to make the company hisfull-time job.)They\\'re going to run the company out of one of their apartments atfirst, and since they don\\'t have any users they don\\'t have to paymuch for infrastructure.  Their main expenses are setting up thecompany, which costs a couple thousand dollars in legal work andregistration fees, and the living expenses of the founders.The phrase \"seed investment\" covers a broad range.  To some VC firmsit means $500,000, but to most startups it means several months\\'living expenses.  We\\'ll suppose our group of friends start with$15,000 from their friend\\'s rich uncle, who they give 5% of thecompany in return.  There\\'s only common stock at this stage.  Theyleave 20% as an options pool for later employees (but they setthings up so that they can issue this stock to themselves if theyget bought early and most is still unissued), and the three founderseach get 25%.By living really cheaply they think they can make the remainingmoney last five months.  When you have five months\\' runway left,how soon do you need to start looking for your next round?  Answer:immediately.  It takes time to find investors, and time (alwaysmore than you expect) for the deal to close even after they sayyes.  So if our group of founders know what they\\'re doing they\\'llstart sniffing around for angel investors right away.  But of coursetheir main job is to build version 1 of their software.The friends might have liked to have more money in this first phase,but being slightly underfunded teaches them an important lesson.For a startup, cheapness is power.  The lower your costs, the moreoptions you have—not just at this stage, but at every point tillyou\\'re profitable.  When you have a high \"burn rate,\" you\\'re alwaysunder time pressure, which means (a) you don\\'t have time for yourideas to evolve, and (b) you\\'re often forced to take deals you don\\'tlike.Every startup\\'s rule should be: spend little, and work fast.After ten weeks\\' work the three friends have built a prototype thatgives one a taste of what their product will do.  It\\'s not whatthey originally set out to do—in the process of writing it, theyhad some new ideas.  And it only does a fraction of what the finishedproduct will do, but that fraction includes stuff that no one elsehas done before.They\\'ve also written at least a skeleton business plan, addressingthe five fundamental questions: what they\\'re going to do, why usersneed it, how large the market is, how they\\'ll make money, and whothe competitors are and why this company is going to beat them.(That last has to be more specific than \"they suck\" or \"we\\'ll workreally hard.\")If you have to choose between spending time on the demo or thebusiness plan, spend most on the demo.   Software is not only moreconvincing, but a better way to explore ideas.Stage 2: Angel RoundWhile writing the prototype, the group has been traversing theirnetwork of friends in search of angel investors.  They find somejust as the prototype is demoable.  When they demo it, one of theangels is willing to invest.  Now the group is looking for moremoney: they want enough to last for a year, and maybe to hire acouple friends.  So they\\'re going to raise $200,000.The angel agrees to invest at a pre-money valuation of $1 million.The company issues $200,000 worth of new shares to the angel; ifthere were 1000 shares before the deal, this means 200 additionalshares.  The angel now owns 200/1200 shares, or a sixth of thecompany, and all the previous shareholders\\' percentage ownershipis diluted by a sixth.  After the deal, the capitalization tablelooks like this:shareholder   shares    percent-------------------------------angel           200       16.7uncle            50        4.2each founder    250       20.8option pool     200       16.7               ----      -----total          1200      100To keep things simple, I had the angel do a straight cash for stockdeal.  In reality the angel might be more likely to make theinvestment in the form of a convertible loan.  A convertible loanis a loan that can be converted into stock later; it works out thesame as a stock purchase in the end, but gives the angel moreprotection against being squashed by VCs in future rounds.Who pays the legal bills for this deal?  The startup, remember,only has a couple thousand left.  In practice this turns out to bea sticky problem that usually gets solved in some improvised way.Maybe the startup can find lawyers who will do it cheaply in thehope of future work if the startup succeeds.  Maybe someone has alawyer friend.  Maybe the angel pays for his lawyer to representboth sides.  (Make sure if you take the latter route that the lawyerisrepresentingyou rather than merely advising you, or hisonly duty is to the investor.)An angel investing $200k would probably expect a seat on the boardof directors.  He might also want preferred stock, meaning a specialclass of stock that has some additional rights over the common stockeveryone else has.  Typically these rights include vetoes over majorstrategic decisions, protection against being diluted in futurerounds, and the right to get one\\'s investment back first if thecompany is sold.Some investors might expect the founders to accept vesting for asum this size, and others wouldn\\'t.  VCs are more likely to requirevesting than angels.  At Viaweb we managed to raise $2.5 millionfrom angels without ever accepting vesting, largely because we wereso inexperienced that we were appalled at the idea.  In practicethis turned out to be good, because it made us harder to push around.Our experience was unusual; vesting is the norm for amounts thatsize.  Y Combinator doesn\\'t require vesting, because (a) we investsuch small amounts, and (b) we think it\\'s unnecessary, and that thehope of getting rich is enough motivation to keep founders at work.But maybe if we were investing millions we would think differently.I should add that vesting is also a way for founders to protectthemselves against one another.  It solves the problem of what todo if one of the founders quits.  So some founders impose it onthemselves when they start the company.The angel deal takes two weeks to close, so we are now three monthsinto the life of the company.The point after you get the first big chunk of angel money willusually be the happiest phase in a startup\\'s life.  It\\'s a lot likebeing a postdoc: you have no immediate financial worries, and fewresponsibilities.  You get to work on juicy kinds of work, likedesigning software.  You don\\'t have to spend time on bureaucraticstuff, because you haven\\'t hired any bureaucrats yet.  Enjoy itwhile it lasts, and get as much done as you can, because you willnever again be so productive.With an apparently inexhaustible sum of money sitting safely in thebank, the founders happily set to work turning their prototype intosomething they can release.  They hire one of their friends—atfirst just as a consultant, so they can try him out—and then amonth later as employee #1. They pay him the smallest salary he canlive on, plus 3% of the company in restricted stock, vesting overfour years.  (So after this the option pool is down to 13.7%).They also spend a little money on a freelance graphic designer.How much stock do you give early employees?  That varies so muchthat there\\'s no conventional number.  If you get someone reallygood, really early, it might be wise to give him as much stock asthe founders.  The one universal rule is that the amount of stockan employee gets decreases polynomially with the age of the company.In other words, you get rich as a power of how early you were.  Soif some friends want you to come work for their startup, don\\'t waitseveral months before deciding.A month later, at the end of month four, our group of founders havesomething they can launch.  Gradually through word of mouth theystart to get users.  Seeing the system in use by real users—peoplethey don\\'t know—gives them lots of new ideas.  Also they findthey now worry obsessively about the status of their server.  (Howrelaxing founders\\' lives must have been when startups wrote VisiCalc.)By the end of month six, the system is starting to have a solidcore of features, and a small but devoted following.  People startto write about it, and the founders are starting to feel like expertsin their field.We\\'ll assume that their startup is one that could put millions moreto use.  Perhaps they need to spend a lot on marketing, or buildsome kind of expensive infrastructure, or hire highly paid salesmen.So they decide to start talking to VCs.  They get introductions toVCs from various sources: their angel investor connects them witha couple; they meet a few at conferences; a couple VCs call themafter reading about them.Step 3: Series A RoundArmed with their now somewhat fleshed-out business plan and ableto demo a real, working system, the founders visit the VCs theyhave introductions to.  They find the VCs intimidating and inscrutable.They all ask the same question: who else have you pitched to?  (VCsare like high school girls: they\\'re acutely aware of their positionin the VC pecking order, and their interest in a company is afunction of the interest other VCs show in it.)One of the VC firms says they want to invest and offers the foundersa term sheet.  A term sheet is a summary of what the deal termswill be when and if they do a deal; lawyers will fill in the detailslater.  By accepting the term sheet, the startup agrees to turnaway other VCs for some set amount of time while this firm does the\"due diligence\" required for the deal.  Due diligence is the corporateequivalent of a background check: the purpose is to uncover anyhidden bombs that might sink the company later, like serious designflaws in the product, pending lawsuits against the company,intellectual property issues, and so on.  VCs\\' legal and financialdue diligence is pretty thorough, but the technical due diligenceis generally a joke.The due diligence discloses no ticking bombs, and six weeks laterthey go ahead with the deal.  Here are the terms: a $2 millioninvestment at a pre-money valuation of $4 million, meaning thatafter the deal closes the VCs will own a third of the company (2 /(4 + 2)).  The VCs also insist that prior to the deal the optionpool be enlarged by an additional hundred shares.  So the totalnumber of new shares issued is 750, and the cap table becomes:shareholder   shares    percent-------------------------------VCs             650       33.3angel           200       10.3uncle            50        2.6each founder    250       12.8employee         36*       1.8     *unvestedoption pool     264       13.5               ----      -----total          1950      100This picture is unrealistic in several respects.  For example, whilethe percentages might end up looking like this, it\\'s unlikely thatthe VCs would keep the existing numbers of shares.  In fact, everybit of the startup\\'s paperwork would probably be replaced, as ifthe company were being founded anew.  Also, the money might comein several tranches, the later ones subject to various conditions—though this is apparently more common in deals with lower-tier VCs(whose lot in life is to fund more dubious startups) than with thetop firms.And of course any VCs reading this are probably rolling on the floorlaughing at how my hypothetical VCs let the angel keep his 10.3 ofthe company.  I admit, this is the Bambi version; in simplifyingthe picture, I\\'ve also made everyone nicer.  In the real world, VCsregard angels the way a jealous husband feels about his wife\\'sprevious boyfriends.  To them the company didn\\'t exist before theyinvested in it.I don\\'t want to give the impression you have to do an angel roundbefore going to VCs.  In this example I stretched things out toshow multiple sources of funding in action. Some startups could godirectly from seed funding to a VC round; several of the companieswe\\'ve funded have.The founders are required to vest their shares over four years, andthe board is now reconstituted to consist of two VCs, two founders,and a fifth person acceptable to both. The angel investor cheerfullysurrenders his board seat.At this point there is nothing new our startup can teach us aboutfunding—or at least, nothing good.The startup will almostcertainly hire more people at this point; those millions must beput to work, after all.  The company may do additional fundingrounds, presumably at higher valuations.  They may if they areextraordinarily fortunate do an IPO, which we should remember isalso in principle a round of funding, regardless of its de factopurpose.  But that, if not beyond the bounds of possibility, isbeyond the scope of this article.Deals Fall ThroughAnyone who\\'s been through a startup will find the preceding portraitto be missing something: disasters.  If there\\'s one thing allstartups have in common, it\\'s that something is always going wrong.And nowhere more than in matters of funding.For example, our hypothetical startup never spent more than halfof one round before securing the next.  That\\'s more ideal thantypical.  Many startups—even successful ones—come close torunning out of money at some point.  Terrible things happen tostartups when they run out of money, because they\\'re designed forgrowth, not adversity.But the most unrealistic thing about the series of deals I\\'vedescribed is that they all closed.  In the startup world, closingis not what deals do.  What deals do is fall through.  If you\\'restarting a startup you would do well to remember that.  Birds fly;fish swim; deals fall through.Why?  Partly the reason deals seem to fall through so often is thatyou lie to yourself.  You want the deal to close, so you start tobelieve it will.  But even correcting for this, startup deals fallthrough alarmingly often—far more often than, say, deals to buyreal estate.  The reason is that it\\'s such a risky environment.People about to fund or acquire a startup are prone to wicked casesof buyer\\'s remorse.  They don\\'t really grasp the risk they\\'re takingtill the deal\\'s about to close.  And then they panic.  And not justinexperienced angel investors, but big companies too.So if you\\'re a startup founder wondering why some angel investorisn\\'t returning your phone calls, you can at least take comfort inthe thought that the same thing is happening to other deals a hundredtimes the size.The example of a startup\\'s history that I\\'ve presented is like askeleton—accurate so far as it goes, but needing to be fleshedout to be a complete picture.  To get a complete picture, just addin every possible disaster.A frightening prospect?  In a way.  And yet also in a way encouraging.The very uncertainty of startups frightens away almost everyone.People overvalue stability—especiallyyoungpeople, who ironically need it least.  And so in starting a startup,as in any really bold undertaking, merely deciding to do it getsyou halfway there.  On the day of the race, most of the other runnerswon\\'t show up.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': \"(This article came about in response to some questions ontheLL1mailing list.  It is nowincorporated inRevenge of the Nerds.)When McCarthy designed Lisp in the late 1950s, it wasa radical departure from existing languages,the most important of which wasFortran.Lisp embodied nine new ideas:1. Conditionals.A conditional is an if-then-elseconstruct.  We take these for granted now.  They wereinventedby McCarthy in the course of developing Lisp. (Fortran at that time only had a conditionalgoto, closely based on the branch instruction in the underlying hardware.)  McCarthy, who was on the Algol committee, gotconditionals into Algol, whence they spread to most otherlanguages.2. A function type.In Lisp, functions are first class objects-- they're a data type just like integers, strings,etc, and have a literal representation, can be stored in variables,can be passed as arguments, and so on.3. Recursion.Recursion existed as a mathematical conceptbefore Lisp of course, but Lisp was the first programming language to supportit.  (It's arguably implicit in making functions first classobjects.)4. A new concept of variables.In Lisp, all variablesare effectively pointers. Values are whathave types, not variables, and assigning or bindingvariables means copying pointers, not what they point to.5. Garbage-collection.6. Programs composed of expressions.Lisp programs are trees of expressions, each of which returns a value.  (In some Lisps expressionscan return multiple values.)  This is in contrast to Fortranand most succeeding languages, which distinguish betweenexpressions and statements.It was natural to have thisdistinction in Fortran because (not surprisingly in a languagewhere the input format was punched cards) the language wasline-oriented.  You could not nest statements.  Andso while you needed expressions for math to work, there wasno point in making anything else return a value, becausethere could not be anything waiting for it.This limitationwent away with the arrival of block-structured languages,but by then it was too late. The distinction betweenexpressions and statements was entrenched.  It spread from Fortran into Algol and thence to both their descendants.When a language is made entirely of expressions, you cancompose expressions however you want.  You can say either(usingArcsyntax)(if foo (= x 1) (= x 2))or(= x (if foo 1 2))7. A symbol type.Symbols differ from strings in thatyou can test equality by comparing a pointer.8. A notation for codeusing trees of symbols.9. The whole language always available.There isno real distinction between read-time, compile-time, and runtime.You can compile or run code while reading, read or run codewhile compiling, and read or compile code at runtime.Running code at read-time lets users reprogram Lisp's syntax;running code at compile-time is the basis of macros; compilingat runtime is the basis of Lisp's use as an extensionlanguage in programs like Emacs; and reading at runtimeenables programs to communicate using s-expressions, anidea recently reinvented as XML.When Lisp was first invented, all these ideas were farremoved from ordinary programming practice, which wasdictated largely by the hardware available in the late 1950s.Over time, the default language, embodiedin a succession of popular languages, hasgradually evolved toward Lisp.  1-5 are now widespread.6 is starting to appear in the mainstream.Python has a form of 7, though there doesn't seem to beany syntax for it.  8, which (with 9) is what makes Lisp macrospossible, is so far still unique to Lisp,perhaps because (a) it requires those parens, or something just as bad, and (b) if you add that final increment of power, you can no longer claim to have invented a new language, but onlyto have designed a new dialect of Lisp ; -)Though useful to present-day programmers, it'sstrange to describe Lisp in terms of itsvariation from the random expedients other languagesadopted.  That was not, probably, how McCarthythought of it.  Lisp wasn't designed to fix the mistakesin Fortran; it came about more as the byproduct of anattempt toaxiomatize computation.Japanese Translation\"},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.October 2010(I wrote this for Forbes, who asked me to write somethingabout the qualities we look for in founders.  In print they had to cutthe last item because they didn\\'t have room.)1. DeterminationThis has turned out to be the most important quality in startupfounders.  We thought when we started Y Combinator that the mostimportant quality would be intelligence.  That\\'s the myth in theValley. And certainly you don\\'t want founders to be stupid.  Butas long as you\\'re over a certain threshold of intelligence, whatmatters most is determination.  You\\'re going to hit a lot ofobstacles.  You can\\'t be the sort of person who getsdemoralizedeasily.Bill Clerico and Rich Aberman ofWePayare a good example.  They\\'redoing a finance startup, which means endless negotiations with big,bureaucratic companies.  When you\\'re starting a startup that dependson deals with big companies to exist, it often feels like they\\'retrying to ignore you out of existence.  But when Bill Clerico startscalling you, you may as well do what he asks, because he is notgoing away.2. FlexibilityYou do not however want the sort of determination implied by phraseslike \"don\\'t give up on your dreams.\"  The world of startups is sounpredictable that you need to be able to modify your dreams on thefly.  The best metaphor I\\'ve found for the combination of determinationand flexibility you need is arunning back.  He\\'s determined to getdownfield, but at any given moment he may need to go sideways oreven backwards to get there.The current record holder for flexibility may be Daniel Gross ofGreplin.  He applied to YC with some bad ecommerce idea.  We toldhim we\\'d fund him if he did something else.  He thought for a second,and said ok.  He then went through two more ideas before settlingon Greplin.  He\\'d only been working on it for a couple days whenhe presented to investors at Demo Day, but he got a lot of interest.He always seems to land on his feet.3. ImaginationIntelligence does matter a lot of course.  It seems like the typethat matters most is imagination.  It\\'s not so important to be ableto solve predefined problems quickly as to be able to come up withsurprising new ideas.  In the startup world, most good ideasseembadinitially.  If they were obviously good, someone would alreadybe doing them.  So you need the kind of intelligence that producesideas with just the right level of craziness.Airbnbis that kind of idea.  In fact, when we funded Airbnb, wethought it was too crazy.  We couldn\\'t believe large numbers ofpeople would want to stay in other people\\'s places.  We funded thembecause we liked the founders so much.  As soon as we heard they\\'dbeen supporting themselves by selling Obama and McCain brandedbreakfast cereal, they were in.  And it turned out the idea was onthe right side of crazy after all.4. NaughtinessThough the most successful founders are usually good people, theytend to have a piratical gleam in their eye.  They\\'re not GoodyTwo-Shoes type good.  Morally, they care about getting the bigquestions right, but not about observing proprieties.  That\\'s whyI\\'d use the word naughty rather than evil.  They delight inbreakingrules, but not rules that matter.  This quality may be redundantthough; it may be implied by imagination.Sam Altman ofLooptis one of the most successful alumni, so weasked him what question we could put on the Y Combinator applicationthat would help us discover more people like him.  He said to askabout a time when they\\'d hacked something to their advantage—hacked in the sense of beating the system, not breaking intocomputers.  It has become one of the questions we pay most attentionto when judging applications.5. FriendshipEmpirically it seems to be hard to start a startup with justonefounder.  Most of the big successes have two or three.  And therelationship between the founders has to be strong.  They mustgenuinely like one another, and work well together.  Startups doto the relationship between the founders what a dog does to a sock:if it can be pulled apart, it will be.Emmett Shear and Justin Kan ofJustin.tvare a good example of closefriends who work well together.  They\\'ve known each other sincesecond grade.  They can practically read one another\\'s minds.  I\\'msure they argue, like all founders, but I have never once sensedany unresolved tension between them.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'Why Startups Condense in America',\n",
       "  'date': 'May 2006',\n",
       "  'essay_text': '(This essay is derived from a keynote at Xtech.)Startups happen in clusters.  There are a lot of them in SiliconValley and Boston, and few in Chicago or Miami.  A country thatwants startups will probably also have to reproduce whatever makesthese clusters form.I\\'ve claimed that therecipeis agreat university near a town smartpeople like.  If you set up those conditions within the US, startupswill form as inevitably as water droplets condense on a cold pieceof metal.  But when I consider what it would take to reproduceSilicon Valley in another country, it\\'s clear the US is a particularlyhumid environment.  Startups condense more easily here.It is by no means a lost cause to try to create a silicon valleyin another country.  There\\'s room not merely to equal Silicon Valley,but to surpass it.  But if you want to do that, you have tounderstand the advantages startups get from being in America.1. The US Allows Immigration.For example, I doubt it would be possible to reproduce SiliconValley in Japan, because one of Silicon Valley\\'s most distinctivefeatures is immigration.  Half the people there speak with accents.And the Japanese don\\'t like immigration.  When they think about howto make a Japanese silicon valley, I suspect they unconsciouslyframe it as how to make one consisting only of Japanese people.This way of framing the question probably guarantees failure.A silicon valley has to be a mecca for the smart and the ambitious,and you can\\'t have a mecca if you don\\'t let people into it.Of course, it\\'s not saying much that America is more open toimmigration than Japan.  Immigration policy is one area where acompetitor could do better.2. The US Is a Rich Country.I could see India one day producing a rival to Silicon Valley.Obviously they have the right people: you can tell that by thenumber of Indians in the current Silicon Valley.  The problem withIndia itself is that it\\'s still so poor.In poor countries, things we take for granted are missing.  A friendof mine visiting India sprained her ankle falling down the stepsin a railway station.  When she turned to see what had happened,she found the steps were all different heights.  In industrializedcountries we walk down steps our whole lives and never think aboutthis, because there\\'s an infrastructure that prevents such a staircasefrom being built.The US has never been so poor as some countries are now.  Therehave never been swarms of beggars in the streets of American cities.So we have no data about what it takes to get from the swarms-of-beggarsstage to the silicon-valley stage.  Could you have both at once,or does there have to be some baseline prosperity before you get asilicon valley?I suspect there is some speed limit to the evolutionof an economy.  Economies are made out of people, and attitudes canonly change a certain amount per generation.3. The US Is Not (Yet) a Police State.Another country I could see wanting to have a silicon valley isChina.  But I doubt they could do it yet either.  China still seemsto be a police state, and although present rulers seem enlightenedcompared to the last, even enlightened despotism can probably onlyget you part way toward being a great economic power.It can get you factories for building things designed elsewhere.Can it get you the designers, though?  Can imagination flourishwhere people can\\'t criticize the government?  Imagination meanshaving odd ideas, and it\\'s hard to have odd ideas about technologywithout also having odd ideas about politics.  And in any case,many technical ideas do have political implications.  So if yousquash dissent, the back pressure will propagate into technicalfields.Singapore would face a similar problem.  Singapore seems very awareof the importance of encouraging startups.  But while energeticgovernment intervention may be able to make a port run efficiently,it can\\'t coax startups into existence.  A state that bans chewinggum has a long way to go before it could create a San Francisco.Do you need a San Francisco?  Might there not be an alternate routeto innovation that goes through obedience and cooperation insteadof individualism?  Possibly, but I\\'d bet not.  Most imaginativepeople seem to share a certain pricklyindependence,whenever and wherever they lived.  You see it in Diogenes tellingAlexander to get out of his light and two thousand years later inFeynman breaking into safes at Los Alamos.Imaginative peopledon\\'t want to follow or lead.  They\\'re most productive when everyonegets to do what they want.Ironically, of all rich countries the US has lost the most civilliberties recently.  But I\\'m not too worried yet.  I\\'m hoping oncethe present administration is out, the natural openness of Americanculture will reassert itself.4. American Universities Are Better.You need a great university to seed a silicon valley, and so farthere are few outside the US.  I asked a handful of American computerscience professors which universities in Europe were most admired,and they all basically said \"Cambridge\" followed by a long pausewhile they tried to think of others.  There don\\'t seem to be manyuniversities elsewhere that compare with the best in America, atleast in technology.In some countries this is the result of a deliberate policy.  TheGerman and Dutch governments, perhaps from fear of elitism, try toensure that all universities are roughly equal in quality.  Thedownside is that none are especially good.   The best professorsare spread out, instead of being concentrated as they are in theUS.  This probably makes them less productive, because they don\\'thave good colleagues to inspire them.  It also means no one universitywill be good enough to act as a mecca, attracting talent from abroadand causing startups to form around it.The case of Germany is a strange one.  The Germans invented themodern university, and up till the 1930s theirs were the best inthe world.  Now they have none that stand out.  As I was mullingthis over, I found myself thinking: \"I can understand why Germanuniversities declined in the 1930s, after they excluded Jews.  Butsurely they should have bounced back by now.\"  Then I realized:maybe not.  There are few Jews left in Germany and most Jews I knowwould not want to move there.  And if you took any great Americanuniversity and removed the Jews, you\\'d have some pretty big gaps.So maybe it would be a lost cause trying to create a silicon valleyin Germany, because you couldn\\'t establish the level of universityyou\\'d need as a seed.It\\'s natural for US universities to compete with one another becauseso many are private.  To reproduce the quality of American universitiesyou probably also have to reproduce this.  If universities arecontrolled by the central government, log-rolling will pull themall toward the mean: the new Institute of X will end up at theuniversity in the district of a powerful politician, instead ofwhere it should be.5. You Can Fire People in America.I think one of the biggest obstacles to creating startups in Europeis the attitude toward employment.  The famously rigid labor lawshurt every company, but startups especially, because startups havethe least time to spare for bureaucratic hassles.The difficulty of firing people is a particular problem for startupsbecause they have no redundancy.  Every person has to do theirjob well.But the problem is more than just that some startup might have aproblem firing someone they needed to.  Across industries andcountries, there\\'s a strong inverse correlation between performanceand job security.  Actors and directors are fired at the end ofeach film, so they have to deliver every time.  Junior professorsare fired by default after a few years unless the university choosesto grant them tenure.  Professional athletes know they\\'ll be pulledif they play badly for just a couple games.  At the other end ofthe scale (at least in the US) are auto workers, New York Cityschoolteachers, and civil servants, who are all nearly impossibleto fire.  The trend is so clear that you\\'d have to be willfullyblind not to see it.Performance isn\\'t everything, you say?  Well, are auto workers,schoolteachers, and civil servantshappierthan actors,professors, and professional athletes?European public opinion will apparently tolerate people being firedin industries where they really care about performance.  Unfortunatelythe only industry they care enough about so far is soccer.  Butthat is at least a precedent.6. In America Work Is Less Identified with Employment.The problem in more traditional places like Europe and Japan goesdeeper than the employment laws.  More dangerous is the attitudethey reflect: that an employee is a kind of servant, whom theemployer has a duty to protect.  It used to be that way in Americatoo.  In 1970 you were still supposed to get a job with a bigcompany, for whom ideally you\\'d work your whole career.  In returnthe company would take care of you: they\\'d try not to fire you,cover your medical expenses, and support you in old age.Gradually employment has been shedding such paternalistic overtonesand becoming simply an economic exchange.  But the importance ofthe new model is not just that it makes it easier for startups togrow.  More important, I think, is that it it makes it easier forpeople tostartstartups.Even in the US most kids graduating from college still think they\\'resupposed to get jobs, as if you couldn\\'t be productive without beingsomeone\\'s employee.  But the less you identify work with employment,the easier it becomes to start a startup.  When you see your careeras a series of different types of work, instead of a lifetime\\'sservice to a single employer, there\\'s less risk in starting yourown company, because you\\'re only replacing one segment instead ofdiscarding the whole thing.The old ideas are so powerful that even the most successful startupfounders have had to struggle against them.  A year after thefounding of Apple, Steve Wozniak still hadn\\'t quit HP.  He stillplanned to work there for life.  And when Jobs found someone togive Apple serious venture funding, on the condition that Woz quit,he initially refused, arguing that he\\'d designed both the Apple Iand the Apple II while working at HP, and there was no reason hecouldn\\'t continue.7.  America Is Not Too Fussy.If there are any laws regulating businesses, you can assume larvalstartups will break most of them, because they don\\'t know what thelaws are and don\\'t have time to find out.For example, many startups in America begin in places where it\\'snot really legal to run a business.  Hewlett-Packard, Apple, andGoogle were all run out of garages.  Many more startups, includingours, were initially run out of apartments.  If the laws againstsuch things were actually enforced, most startups wouldn\\'t happen.That could be a problem in fussier countries.  If Hewlett and Packardtried running an electronics company out of their garage inSwitzerland, the old lady next door would report them to the municipalauthorities.But the worst problem in other countries is probably the effortrequired just to start a company.  A friend of mine started a companyin Germany in the early 90s, and was shocked to discover, amongmany other regulations, that you needed $20,000 in capital toincorporate.  That\\'s one reason I\\'m not typing this on an Apfellaptop.  Jobs and Wozniak couldn\\'t have come up with that kind ofmoney in a company financed by selling a VW bus and an HP calculator.We couldn\\'t have started Viaweb either.Here\\'s a tip for governments that want to encourage startups: readthe stories of existing startups, and then try to simulate whatwould have happened in your country.  When you hit something thatwould have killed Apple, prune it off.Startups aremarginal.They\\'re started by the poor and thetimid; they begin in marginal space and spare time; they\\'re startedby people who are supposed to be doing something else; and thoughbusinesses, their founders often know nothing about business.  Youngstartups are fragile.  A society that trims its margins sharplywill kill them all.8. America Has a Large Domestic Market.What sustains a startup in the beginning is the prospect of gettingtheir initial product out.  The successful ones therefore make thefirst version as simple as possible.  In the US they usually beginby making something just for the local market.This works in America, because the local market is 300 millionpeople.  It wouldn\\'t work so well in Sweden.  In a small country,a startup has a harder task: they have to sell internationally fromthe start.The EU was designed partly to simulate a single, large domesticmarket.  The problem is that the inhabitants still speak manydifferent languages.  So a software startup in Sweden is still ata disadvantage relative to one in the US, because they have to dealwith internationalization from the beginning.  It\\'s significantthat the most famous recent startup in Europe, Skype, worked on aproblem that was intrinsically international.However, for better or worse it looks as if Europe will in a fewdecades speak a single language.  When I was a student in Italy in1990, few Italians spoke English.  Now all educated people seem tobe expected to-- and Europeans do not like to seem uneducated.  Thisis presumably a taboo subject, but if present trends continue,French and German will eventually go the way of Irish and Luxembourgish:they\\'ll be spoken in homes and by eccentric nationalists.9. America Has Venture Funding.Startups are easier to start in America because funding is easierto get.  There are now a few VC firms outside the US, but startupfunding doesn\\'t only come from VC firms.  A more important source,because it\\'s more personal and comes earlier in the process, ismoney from individual angel investors.  Google might never have gotto the point where they could raise millions from VC funds if theyhadn\\'t first raised a hundred thousand from Andy Bechtolsheim.  Andhe could help them because he was one of the founders of Sun.  Thispattern is repeated constantly in startup hubs.  It\\'s this patternthatmakesthem startup hubs.The good news is, all you have to do to get the process rolling isget those first few startups successfully launched.  If they stickaround after they get rich, startup founders will almost automaticallyfund and encourage new startups.The bad news is that the cycle is slow.  It probably takes fiveyears, on average, before a startup founder can make angel investments.And while governmentsmightbe able to set up local VC fundsby supplying the money themselves and recruiting people from existingfirms to run them, only organic growth can produce angel investors.Incidentally, America\\'s private universities are one reason there\\'sso much venture capital.  A lot of the money in VC funds comes fromtheir endowments.  So another advantage of private universities isthat a good chunk of the country\\'s wealth is managed by enlightenedinvestors.10. America Has Dynamic Typing for Careers.Compared to other industrialized countries the US is disorganizedabout routing people into careers.  For example, in America peopleoften don\\'t decide to go to medical school till they\\'ve finishedcollege.  In Europe they generally decide in high school.The European approach reflects the old idea that each person has asingle, definite occupation-- which is not far from the idea thateach person has a natural \"station\" in life.  If this were true,the most efficient plan would be to discover each person\\'s stationas early as possible, so they could receive the training appropriateto it.In the US things are more haphazard.  But that turns out to be anadvantage as an economy gets more liquid, just as dynamic typingturns out to work better than static for ill-defined problems.  Thisis particularly true with startups.  \"Startup founder\" is not thesort of career a high school student would choose.  If you ask atthat age, people will choose conservatively.  They\\'ll choosewell-understood occupations like engineer, or doctor, or lawyer.Startups are the kind of thing people don\\'t plan, so you\\'re morelikely to get them in a society where it\\'s ok to make career decisionson the fly.For example, in theory the purpose of a PhD program is to train youto do research.  But fortunately in the US this is another rulethat isn\\'t very strictly enforced.  In the US most people in CS PhDprograms are there simply because they wanted to learn more.  Theyhaven\\'t decided what they\\'ll do afterward.  So American grad schoolsspawn a lot of startups, because students don\\'t feel they\\'re failingif they don\\'t go into research.Those worried about America\\'s \"competitiveness\" often suggestspending more on public schools.  But perhaps America\\'s lousy publicschools have a hidden advantage.  Because they\\'re so bad, the kidsadopt an attitude of waiting for college.  I did; I knew I waslearning so little that I wasn\\'t even learning what the choiceswere, let alone which to choose.  This is demoralizing, but it doesat least make you keep an open mind.Certainly if I had to choose between bad high schools and gooduniversities, like the US, and good high schools and bad universities,like most other industrialized countries, I\\'d take the US system.Better to make everyone feel like a late bloomer than a failed childprodigy.AttitudesThere\\'s one item conspicuously missing from this list: Americanattitudes.  Americans are said to be more entrepreneurial, and lessafraid of risk.  But America has no monopoly on this.  Indians andChinese seem plenty entrepreneurial, perhaps more than Americans.Some say Europeans are less energetic, but I don\\'t believe it.  Ithink the problem with Europe is not that they lack balls, but thatthey lack examples.Even in the US, the most successful startup founders are oftentechnical people who are quite timid, initially, about the idea ofstarting their own company. Few are the sort of backslappingextroverts one thinks of as typically American.  They can usuallyonly summon up the activation energy to start a startup when theymeet people who\\'ve done it and realize they could too.I think what holds back European hackers is simply that they don\\'tmeet so many people who\\'ve done it. You see that variation evenwithin the US.  Stanford students are more entrepreneurial thanYale students, but not because of some difference in their characters;the Yale students just have fewer examples.I admit there seem to be different attitudes toward ambition inEurope and the US.  In the US it\\'s ok to be overtly ambitious, andin most of Europe it\\'s not.  But this can\\'t be an intrinsicallyEuropean quality; previous generations of Europeans were as ambitiousas Americans.  What happened?  My hypothesis is that ambition wasdiscredited by the terrible things ambitious people did in the firsthalf of the twentieth century.  Now swagger is out. (Even now theimage of a very ambitious German presses a button or two, doesn\\'tit?)It would be surprising if European attitudes weren\\'t affected bythe disasters of the twentieth century.  It takes a while to beoptimistic after events like that.  But ambition is human nature.Gradually it will re-emerge.How To Do BetterI don\\'t mean to suggest by this list that America is the perfectplace for startups.  It\\'s the best place so far, but the samplesize is small, and \"so far\" is not very long.   On historical time scales, what we have now is just aprototype.So let\\'s look at Silicon Valley the way you\\'d look at a productmade by a competitor.  What weaknesses could you exploit?  How couldyou make something users would like better?  The users in this caseare those critical few thousand people you\\'d like to move to yoursilicon valley.To start with, Silicon Valley is too far from San Francisco.  PaloAlto, the original ground zero, is about thirty miles away, and thepresent center more like forty.  So people who come to work inSilicon Valley face an unpleasant choice: either live in the boringsprawl of the valley proper, or live in San Francisco and endurean hour commute each way.The best thing would be if the silicon valley were not merely closerto the interesting city, but interesting itself.  And there is alot of room for improvement here.  Palo Alto is not so bad, buteverything built since is the worst sort of strip development.  Youcan measure how demoralizing it is by the number of people who willsacrifice two hours a day commuting rather than live there.Another area in which you could easily surpass Silicon Valley ispublic transportation.  There is a train running the length of it,and by American standards it\\'s not bad.  Which is to say that toJapanese or Europeans it would seem like something out of the thirdworld.The kind of people you want to attract to your silicon valley liketo get around by train, bicycle, and on foot.  So if you want tobeat America, design a town that puts cars last.  It will be a whilebefore any American city can bring itself to do that.Capital GainsThere are also a couple things you could do to beat America at thenational level.  One would be to have lower capital gains taxes.It doesn\\'t seem critical to have the lowestincometaxes,because to take advantage of those, people have to move.Butif capital gains rates vary, you move assets, not yourself, sochanges are reflected at market speeds.  The lower the rate, thecheaper it is to buy stock in growing companies as opposed to realestate, or bonds, or stocks bought for the dividends they pay.So if you want to encourage startups you should have a low rate oncapital gains.  Politicians are caught between a rock and a hardplace here, however: make the capital gains rate low and be accusedof creating \"tax breaks for the rich,\" or make it high and starvegrowing companies of investment capital.   As Galbraith said,politics is a matter of choosing between the unpalatable and thedisastrous.  A lot of governments experimented with the disastrousin the twentieth century; now the trend seems to be toward themerely unpalatable.Oddly enough, the leaders now are European countries like Belgium,which has a capital gains tax rate of zero.ImmigrationThe other place you could beat the US would be with smarter immigrationpolicy.  There are huge gains to be made here.  Silicon valleys aremade of people, remember.Like a company whose software runs on Windows, those in the currentSilicon Valley are all too aware of the shortcomings of the INS,but there\\'s little they can do about it.  They\\'re hostages of theplatform.America\\'s immigration system has never been well run, and since2001 there has been an additional admixture of paranoia.  Whatfraction of the smart people who want to come to America can evenget in?  I doubt even half.  Which means if you made a competingtechnology hub that let in all smart people, you\\'d immediately getmore than half the world\\'s top talent, for free.US immigration policy is particularly ill-suited to startups, becauseit reflects a model of work from the 1970s.  It assumes good technicalpeople have college degrees, and that work means working for a bigcompany.If you don\\'t have a college degree you can\\'t get an H1B visa, thetype usually issued to programmers.  But a test that excludes SteveJobs, Bill Gates, and Michael Dell can\\'t be a good one.  Plus youcan\\'t get a visa for working on your own company, only for workingas an employee of someone else\\'s.  And if you want to apply forcitizenship you daren\\'t work for a startup at all, because if yoursponsor goes out of business, you have to start over.American immigration policy keeps out most smart people, and channelsthe rest into unproductive jobs.  It would be easy to do better.Imagine if, instead, you treated immigration like recruiting-- ifyou made a conscious effort to seek out the smartest people and getthem to come to your country.A country that got immigration right would have a huge advantage.At this point you could become a mecca for smart people simply byhaving an immigration system that let them in.A Good VectorIf you look at the kinds of things you have to do to create anenvironment where startups condense, none are great sacrifices.Great universities?  Livable towns?  Civil liberties?  Flexibleemployment laws?  Immigration policies that let in smart people?Tax laws that encourage growth?  It\\'s not as if you have to riskdestroying your country to get a silicon valley; these are all goodthings in their own right.And then of course there\\'s the question, can you afford not to?  Ican imagine a future in which the default choice of ambitious youngpeople is to start theirowncompanyrather than work for someone else\\'s.  I\\'m not sure that will happen,but it\\'s where the trend points now.  And if that is the future,places that don\\'t have startups will be a whole step behind,like those that missed the Industrial Revolution.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': '(I originally intended this for startup founders, who are oftensurprised by the attention they get as their companies grow, butit applies equally to anyone who becomes famous.)If you become sufficiently famous, you\\'ll acquire some fans wholike you too much. These people are sometimes called \"fanboys,\" andthough I dislike that term, I\\'m going to have to use it here.  Weneed some word for them, because this is a distinct phenomenon fromsomeone simply liking your work.A fanboy is obsessive and uncritical. Liking you becomes part oftheir identity, and they create an image of you in their own headthat is much better than reality. Everything you do is good, becauseyou do it. If you do something bad, they find a way to see it asgood. And their love for you is not, usually, a quiet, private one.They want everyone to know how great you are.Well, you may be thinking, I could do without this kind of obsessivefan, but I know there are all kinds of people in the world, and ifthis is the worst consequence of fame, that\\'s not so bad.Unfortunately this is not the worst consequence of fame. As wellas fanboys, you\\'ll have haters.A hater is obsessive and uncritical. Disliking you becomes part oftheir identity, and they create an image of you in their own headthat is much worse than reality. Everything you do is bad, becauseyou do it. If you do something good, they find a way to see it asbad. And their dislike for you is not, usually, a quiet, privateone. They want everyone to know how awful you are.If you\\'re thinking of checking, I\\'ll save you the trouble. Thesecond and fifth paragraphs are identical except for \"good\" beingswitched to \"bad\" and so on.I spent years puzzling about haters.  What are they, and where dothey come from? Then one day it dawned on me. Haters are just fanboyswith the sign switched.Note that by haters, I don\\'t simply mean trolls. I\\'m not talking about people who say bad things about you and then move on. I\\'m talkingabout the much smaller group of people for whom this becomes a kind of obsession and who do it repeatedly over a long period.Like fans, haters seem to be an automatic consequence of fame.Anyone sufficiently famous will have them. And like fans, hatersare energized by the fame of whoever they hate. They hear a songby some pop singer. They don\\'t like it much. If the singer were anobscure one, they\\'d just forget about it. But instead they keephearing her name, and this seems to drive some people crazy.Everyone\\'s always going on about this singer, but she\\'s no good!She\\'s a fraud!That word \"fraud\" is an important one. It\\'s the spectral signatureof a hater to regard the object of their hatred as afraud. Theycan\\'t deny their fame. Indeed, their fame is if anything exaggeratedin the hater\\'s mind. They notice every mention of the singer\\'s name,because every mention makes them angrier. In their own minds theyexaggerate both the singer\\'s fame and her lack of talent, and theonly way to reconcile those two ideas is to conclude that she hastricked everyone.What sort of people become haters? Can anyone become one? I\\'m notsure about this, but I\\'ve noticed some patterns. Haters are generallylosers in a very specific sense: although they are occasionallytalented, they have never achieved much. And indeed, anyonesuccessful enough to have achieved significant fame would be unlikelyto regard another famous person as a fraud on that account, becauseanyone famous knows how random fame is.But haters are not always complete losers. They are not always theproverbial guy living in his mom\\'s basement. Many are, but somehave some amount of talent. In fact I suspect that a sense offrustrated talent is what drives some people to become haters.They\\'re not just saying \"It\\'s unfair that so-and-so is famous,\" but\"It\\'s unfair that so-and-so is famous, and not me.\"Could a hater be cured if they achieved something impressive? Myguess is that\\'s a moot point, because theynever will. I\\'ve beenable to observe for long enough that I\\'m fairly confident the patternworks both ways: not only do people who do great work never becomehaters, haters never do great work. Although I dislike the word\"fanboy,\" it\\'s evocative of something important about both hatersand fanboys. It implies that the fanboy is so slavishly predictable in his admirationthat he\\'s diminished as a result, that he\\'s less than a man.Haters seem even more diminished. I can imagine being a fanboy.I can think of people whose work I admire so much that I could abasemyself before them out of sheer gratitude. If P. G.  Wodehouse werestill alive, I could see myself being a Wodehouse fanboy. But Icould not imagine being a hater.Knowing that haters are just fanboys with the sign bit flipped makesit much easier to deal with them. We don\\'t need a separate theoryof haters. We can just use existing techniques for dealing withobsessive fans.The most important of which is simply not to think much about them.If you\\'re like most people who become famous enough to acquirehaters, your initial reaction will be one of mystification. Whydoes this guy seem to have it in for me? Where does his obsessiveenergy come from, and what makes him so appallingly nasty? What didI do to set him off? Is it something I can fix?The mistake here is to think of the hater as someone you have adispute with. When you have a dispute with someone, it\\'s usually agood idea to try to understand why they\\'re upset and then fix thingsif you can. Disputes are distracting. But it\\'s a false analogy tothink of a hater as someone you have a dispute with.  It\\'s anunderstandable mistake, if you\\'ve never encountered haters before.But when you realize that you\\'re dealing with a hater, and what ahater is, it\\'s clear that it\\'s a waste of time even to think aboutthem. If you have obsessive fans, do you spend any time wonderingwhat makes them love you so much? No, you just think \"somepeople are kind of crazy,\" and that\\'s the end of it.Since haters are equivalent to fanboys, that\\'s the way to deal withthem too. There may have been something that set them off. But it\\'snot something that would have set off a normal person, so there\\'sno reason to spend any time thinking about it. It\\'s not you, it\\'sthem.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.October 2010Silicon Valley proper is mostly suburban sprawl.  At first glanceit doesn\\'t seem there\\'s anything to see.  It\\'s not the sort of placethat has conspicuous monuments.  But if you look, there are subtlesigns you\\'re in a place that\\'s different from other places.1.StanfordUniversityStanford is a strange place.  Structurally it is to an ordinaryuniversity what suburbia is to a city.  It\\'s enormously spread out,and feels surprisingly empty much of the time.  But notice theweather.  It\\'s probably perfect.  And notice the beautiful mountainsto the west.  And though you can\\'t see it, cosmopolitan San Franciscois 40 minutes to the north.  That combination is much of the reasonSilicon Valley grew up around this university and not some otherone.2.UniversityAveA surprising amount of the work of the Valley is done in the cafeson or just off University Ave in Palo Alto.  If you visit on aweekday between 10 and 5, you\\'ll often see founders pitchinginvestors.  In case you can\\'t tell, the founders are the ones leaningforward eagerly, and the investors are the ones sitting back withslightly pained expressions.3.The LuckyOfficeThe office at 165 University Ave was Google\\'s first.  Then it wasPaypal\\'s.  (Now it\\'sWepay\\'s.)  The interesting thing about it isthe location.  It\\'s a smart move to put a startup in a place withrestaurants and people walking around instead of in an office park,because then the people who work there want to stay there, insteadof fleeing as soon as conventional working hours end.  They go outfor dinner together, talk about ideas, and then come back andimplement them.It\\'s important to realize that Google\\'s current location in anoffice park is not where they started; it\\'s just where they wereforced to move when they needed more space.  Facebook was tillrecently across the street, till they too had to move because theyneeded more space.4.OldPalo AltoPalo Alto was not originally a suburb.  For the first 100 years orso of its existence, it was a college town out in the countryside.Then in the mid 1950s it was engulfed in a wave of suburbia thatraced down the peninsula.  But Palo Alto north of Oregon expresswaystill feels noticeably different from the area around it.  It\\'s oneof the nicest places in the Valley.  The buildings are old (thoughincreasingly they are being torn down and replaced with genericMcMansions) and the trees are tall.  But houses are veryexpensive—around $1000 per square foot. This is post-exitSilicon Valley.5.SandHill RoadIt\\'s interesting to see the VCs\\' offices on the north side of SandHill Road precisely because they\\'re so boringly uniform.  Thebuildings are all more or less the same, their exteriors expressvery little, and they are arranged in a confusing maze.  (I\\'ve beenvisiting them for years and I still occasionally get lost.) It\\'snot a coincidence.  These buildings are a pretty accurate reflectionof the VC business.If you go on a weekday you may see groups of founders there to meetVCs. But mostly you won\\'t see anyone; bustling is the last wordyou\\'d use to describe the atmos.  Visiting Sand Hill Road remindsyou that the opposite of \"down and dirty\" would be \"up and clean.\"6.CastroStreetIt\\'s a tossup whether Castro Street or University Ave should beconsidered the heart of the Valley now.  University Ave would havebeen 10 years ago.  But Palo Alto is getting expensive.  Increasinglystartups are located in Mountain View, and Palo Alto is a placethey come to meet investors.  Palo Alto has a lot of differentcafes, but there is one that clearly dominates in Mountain View:RedRock.7.GoogleGoogle spread out from its first building in Mountain View to a lot of the surrounding ones.  But because thebuildings were built at different times by different people,the place doesn\\'t have the sterile, walled-off feel that a typicallarge company\\'s headquarters have.  It definitely has a flavor ofits own though.  You sense there is something afoot.  The generalatmos is vaguely utopian; there are lots of Priuses, and people wholook like they drive them.You can\\'t get into Google unless you know someone there.  It\\'s verymuch worth seeing inside if you can, though.   Ditto for Facebook,at the end of California Ave in Palo Alto, though there is nothingto see outside.8.SkylineDriveSkyline Drive runs along the crest of the Santa Cruz mountains.  Onone side is the Valley, and on the other is the sea—whichbecause it\\'s cold and foggy and has few harbors, plays surprisinglylittle role in the lives of people in the Valley, considering howclose it is.  Along some parts of Skyline the dominant trees arehuge redwoods, and in others they\\'re live oaks.  Redwoods mean thoseare the parts where the fog off the coast comes in at night; redwoodscondense rain out of fog.  The MROSD manages a collection ofgreat walking trailsoffSkyline.9.280Silicon Valley has two highways running the length of it: 101, whichis pretty ugly, and 280, which is one of the more beautiful highwaysin the world.  I always take 280 when I have a choice.  Notice thelong narrow lake to the west? That\\'s the San Andreas Fault.  Itruns along the base of the hills, then heads uphill through PortolaValley.  One of the MROSD trails runsright alongthe fault.  A string of rich neighborhoods runs along thefoothills to the west of 280: Woodside, Portola Valley, Los AltosHills, Saratoga, Los Gatos.SLACgoes right under 280 a little bit south of Sand Hill Road.

       "  'essay_text': 'For nearly all of history the success of a society was proportionateto its ability to assemble large and disciplined organizations.Those who bet on economies of scale generally won, which meant thelargest organizations were the most successful ones.Things have already changed so much that this is hard for us tobelieve, but till just a few decades ago the largest organizationstended to be the most progressive.  An ambitious kid graduatingfrom college in 1960 wanted to work in the huge, gleaming officesof Ford, or General Electric, or NASA.  Small meant small-time.Small in 1960 didn\\'t mean a cool little startup.  It meant uncleSid\\'s shoe store.When I grew up in the 1970s, the idea of the \"corporate ladder\" wasstill very much alive.  The standard plan was to try to get into agood college, from which one would be drafted into some organizationand then rise to positions of gradually increasing responsibility.The more ambitious merely hoped to climb the same ladder faster.But in the late twentieth century something changed.  It turned outthat economies of scale were not the only force at work.  Particularlyin technology, the increase in speed one could get from smallergroups started to trump the advantages of size.The future turned out to be different from the one we were expectingin 1970.  The domed cities and flying cars we expected have failedto materialize.  But fortunately so have the jumpsuits with badgesindicating our specialty and rank.  Instead of being dominated bya few, giant tree-structured organizations, it\\'s now looking likethe economy of the future will be a fluid network of smaller,independent units.It\\'s not so much that large organizations stopped working.  There\\'sno evidence that famously successful organizations like the Romanarmy or the British East India Company were any less afflicted byprotocol and politics than organizations of the same size today.But they were competing against opponents who couldn\\'t change therules on the fly by discovering new technology.  Now it turns outthe rule \"large and disciplined organizations win\" needs to have aqualification appended: \"at games that change slowly.\" No one knewtill change reached a sufficient speed.Large organizationswillstart to do worse now, though,because for the first time in history they\\'re no longer getting thebest people.  An ambitious kid graduating from college now doesn\\'twant to work for a big company.  They want to work for the hotstartup that\\'s rapidly growing into one.  If they\\'re really ambitious,they want to start it.This doesn\\'t mean big companies will disappear.  To say thatstartups will succeed implies that big companies will exist, becausestartups that succeed either become big companies or are acquiredby them.But large organizations will probably never againplay the leading role they did up till the last quarter of thetwentieth century.It\\'s kind of surprising that a trend that lasted so long would everrun out.  How often does it happen that a rule works for thousandsof years, then switches polarity?The millennia-long run of bigger-is-better left us with a lot oftraditionsthat are now obsolete, but extremely deeply rooted.Which means the ambitious can now do arbitrage on them.  It willbe very valuable to understand precisely which ideas to keep andwhich can now be discarded.The place to look is where the spread of smallness began: in theworld of startups.There have always been occasional cases, particularly in the US,of ambitious people who grew the ladder under them instead ofclimbing it.  But till recently this was an anomalous route thattended to be followed only by outsiders.  It was no coincidencethat the great industrialists of the nineteenth century had solittle formal education.  As huge as their companies eventuallybecame, they were all essentially mechanics and shopkeepers atfirst.  That was a social step no one with a college education wouldtake if they could avoid it.  Till the rise of technology startups,and in particular, Internet startups, it was very unusual foreducated people to start their own businesses.The eight men who left Shockley Semiconductor to found FairchildSemiconductor, the original Silicon Valley startup, weren\\'t eventrying to start a company at first.  They were just looking for acompany willing to hire them as a group.  Then one of their parentsintroduced them to a small investment bank that offered to findfunding for them to start their own, so they did.  But starting acompany was an alien idea to them; it was something they backedinto.Now I would guess that practically every Stanford or Berkeleyundergrad who knows how to program has at least considered the ideaof starting a startup.  East Coast universities are not far behind,and British universities only a little behind them.  This patternsuggests that attitudes at Stanford and Berkeley are not an anomaly,but a leading indicator.  This is the way the world is going.Of course, Internet startups are still only a fraction of the world\\'seconomy.  Could a trend based on them be that powerful?I think so.  There\\'s no reason to suppose there\\'s any limit to theamount of work that could be done in this area.  Like science,wealth seems to expand fractally.  Steam power was a sliver of theBritish economy when Watt started working on it.  But his work ledto more work till that sliver had expanded into something biggerthan the whole economy of which it had initially been a part.The same thing could happen with the Internet.  If Internet startupsoffer the best opportunity for ambitious people, then a lot ofambitious people will start them, and this bit of the economy willballoon in the usual fractal way.Even if Internet-related applications only become a tenth of theworld\\'s economy, this component will set the tone for the rest.The most dynamic part of the economy always does, in everythingfrom salaries to standards of dress.  Not just because of itsprestige, but because the principles underlying the most dynamicpart of the economy tend to be ones that work.For the future, the trend to bet on seems to be networks of small,autonomous groups whose performance is measured individually.  Andthe societies that win will be the ones with the least impedance.As with the original industrial revolution, some societies are goingto be better at this than others.  Within a generation of its birthin England, the Industrial Revolution had spread to continentalEurope and North America.  But it didn\\'t spread everywhere.  Thisnew way of doing things could only take root in places that wereprepared for it.  It could only spread to places that already hada vigorous middle class.There is a similar social component to the transformation that beganin Silicon Valley in the 1960s.  Two new kinds of techniques weredeveloped there: techniques for building integrated circuits, andtechniques for building a new type of company designed to grow fastby creating new technology.  The techniques for building integratedcircuits spread rapidly to other countries.  But the techniques forbuilding startups didn\\'t.  Fifty years later, startups are ubiquitousin Silicon Valley and common in a handful of other US cities, butthey\\'re still an anomaly in most of the world.Part of the reason—possibly the main reason—that startupshave not spread as broadly as the Industrial Revolution did is theirsocial disruptiveness.  Though it brought many social changes, theIndustrial Revolution was not fighting the principle that biggeris better.  Quite the opposite: the two dovetailed beautifully.The new industrial companies adapted the customs of existing largeorganizations like the military and the civil service, and theresulting hybrid worked well.  \"Captains of industry\" issued ordersto \"armies of workers,\" and everyone knew what they were supposedto do.Startups seem to go more against the grain, socially.  It\\'s hardfor them to flourish in societies that value hierarchy and stability,just as it was hard for industrialization to flourish in societiesruled by people who stole at will from the merchant class.  Butthere were already a handful of countries past that stage when theIndustrial Revolution happened.   There do not seem to be that manyready this time.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': '(Foreword to Jessica Livingston\\'sFounders at Work.)Apparently sprinters reach their highest speed right out of theblocks, and spend the rest of the race slowing down.  The winnersslow down the least.  It\\'s that way with most startups too.  Theearliest phase is usually the most productive.  That\\'s when theyhave the really big ideas.  Imagine what Apple was like when 100%of its employees were either Steve Jobs or Steve Wozniak.The striking thing about this phase is that it\\'s completely differentfrom most people\\'s idea of what business is like.  If you lookedin people\\'s heads (or stock photo collections) for images representing\"business,\" you\\'d get images of people dressed up in suits, groupssitting around conference tables looking serious, Powerpointpresentations, people producing thick reports for one another toread.   Early stage startups are the exact opposite of this.  Andyet they\\'re probably the most productive part of the whole economy.Why the disconnect?  I think there\\'s a general principle at workhere: the less energy people expend on performance, the more theyexpend on appearances to compensate.  More often than not the energythey expend on seeming impressive makes their actual performanceworse.  A few years ago I read an article in which a car magazinemodified the \"sports\" model of some production car to get the fastestpossible standing quarter mile.  You know how they did it?  Theycut off all the crap the manufacturer had bolted onto the car tomake itlookfast.Business is broken the same way that car was.  The effort that goesinto looking productive is not merely wasted, but actually makesorganizations less productive.  Suits, for example.  Suits do nothelp people to think better.  I bet most executives at big companiesdo their best thinking when they wake up on Sunday morning and godownstairs in their bathrobe to make a cup of coffee.  That\\'s whenyou have ideas.  Just imagine what a company would be like if peoplecould think that well at work.  People do in startups, at leastsome of the time.  (Half the time you\\'re in a panic because yourservers are on fire, but the other half you\\'re thinking as deeplyas most people only get to sitting alone on a Sunday morning.)Ditto for most of the other differences between startups and whatpasses for productivity in big companies.  And yet conventionalideas of professionalism have such an iron grip on our minds thateven startup founders are affected by them.  In our startup, whenoutsiders came to visit we tried hard to seem \"professional.\" We\\'dclean up our offices, wear better clothes, try to arrange that alot of people were there during conventional office hours.  In fact,programming didn\\'t get done by well-dressed people at clean desksduring office hours.  It got done by badly dressed people (I wasnotorious for programmming wearing just a towel) in offices strewnwith junk at 2 in the morning.  But no visitor would understandthat.  Not even investors, who are supposed to be able to recognizereal productivity when they see it.  Even we were affected by theconventional wisdom.  We thought of ourselves as impostors, succeedingdespite being totally unprofessional.  It was as if we\\'d created aFormula 1 car but felt sheepish because it didn\\'t look like a carwas supposed to look.In the car world, there are at least some people who know that ahigh performance car looks like a Formula 1 racecar, not a sedanwith giant rims and a fake spoiler bolted to the trunk.  Why notin business?  Probably because startups are so small.  The reallydramatic growth happens when a startup only has three or four people,so only three or four people see that, whereas tens of thousandssee business as it\\'s practiced by Boeing or Philip Morris.This book can help fix that problem, by showing everyone what, tillnow, only a handful people got to see: what happens in the firstyear of a startup.  This is what real productivity looks like. Thisis the Formula 1 racecar.  It looks weird, but it goes fast.Of course, big companies won\\'t be able to do everything thesestartups do.  In big companies there\\'s always going to be morepolitics, and less scope for individual decisions.  But seeing whatstartups are really like will at least show other organizationswhat to aim for.  The time may soon be coming when instead ofstartups trying to seem more corporate, corporations will try toseem more like startups.  That would be a good thing.JapaneseTranslationFounders at WorkThere can\\'t be more than a couple thousandpeople who know first-hand what happens in the first month of asuccessful startup.   Jessica Livingston got them to tell us.  So despite the interview format, this isreally a how-to book.  It is probably the single most valuable book a startup founder could read.'},\n",

When you suppress heresies,you don't just prevent people from contradicting the mistakenassumption you're trying to protect. You also suppress any ideathat implies indirectly that it's false.Every cherished mistaken assumption hasa dead zone of unexplored ideas around it.

       "  'essay_text': 'A few weeks ago I had a thought so heretical that it really surprisedme. It may not matter all that much where you go to college.For me, as for a lot of middle class kids, getting into a goodcollege was more or less the meaning of life when I was growing up.What was I?  A student.  To do that well meant to get good grades.Why did one have to get good grades?  To get into a good college.And why did one want to do that?  There seemed to be several reasons:you\\'d learn more, get better jobs, make more money.  But it didn\\'tmatter exactly what the benefits would be.  College was a bottleneckthrough which all your future prospects passed; everything wouldbe better if you went to a better college.A few weeks ago I realized that somewhere along the line I hadstopped believing that.What first set me thinking about this was the new trend of worryingobsessively about whatkindergartenyour kids go to.  It seemed tome this couldn\\'t possibly matter.  Either it won\\'t help your kidget into Harvard, or if it does, getting into Harvard won\\'t meanmuch anymore.  And then I thought: how much does it mean even now?It turns out I have a lot of data about that.  My three partnersand I run a seed stage investment firm calledY Combinator.  Weinvest when the company is just a couple guys and an idea.  Theidea doesn\\'t matter much; it will change anyway.  Most of ourdecision is based on the founders.  The average founder is threeyears out of college.  Many have just graduated; a few are stillin school.  So we\\'re in much the same position as a graduate program,or a company hiring people right out of college.  Except our choicesare immediately and visibly tested.  There are two possible outcomesfor a startup: success or failure—and usually you know within ayear which it will be.The test applied to a startup is among the purest of real worldtests.  A startup succeeds or fails depending almost entirely onthe efforts of the founders.  Success is decided by the market: youonly succeed if users like what you\\'ve built.  And users don\\'t carewhere you went to college.As well as having precisely measurable results, we have a lot ofthem.  Instead of doing a small number of large deals like atraditional venture capital fund, we do a large number of smallones.  We currently fund about 40 companies a year, selected fromabout 900 applications representing a total of about 2000 people.Between the volume of people we judge and the rapid, unequivocaltest that\\'s applied to our choices, Y Combinator has been anunprecedented opportunity for learning how to pick winners.  Oneof the most surprising things we\\'ve learned is how little it matterswhere people went to college.I thought I\\'d already been cured of caring about that.  There\\'snothing like going to grad school at Harvard to cure you of anyillusions you might have about the average Harvard undergrad.  Andyet Y Combinator showed us we were still overestimating people who\\'dbeen to elite colleges.  We\\'d interview people from MIT or Harvardor Stanford and sometimes find ourselves thinking: theymustbesmarter than they seem.  It took us a few iterations to learn totrust our senses.Practically everyone thinks that someone who went to MIT or Harvardor Stanford must be smart.  Even people who hate you for it believeit.But when you think about what it means to have gone to an elitecollege, how could this be true?   We\\'re talking about a decisionmade by admissions officers—basically, HR people—based on acursory examination of a huge pile of depressingly similar applicationssubmitted by seventeen year olds.  And what do they have to go on?An easily gamed standardized test; a short essay telling you whatthe kid thinks you want to hear; an interview with a random alum;a high school record that\\'s largely an index of obedience.  Whowould rely on such a test?And yet a lot of companies do.  A lot of companies are very muchinfluenced by where applicants went to college.  How could they be?I think I know the answer to that.There used to be a saying in the corporate world: \"No one ever gotfired for buying IBM.\"  You no longer hear this about IBM specifically,but the idea is very much alive; there is a whole category of\"enterprise\" software companies that exist to take advantage of it.People buying technology for large organizations don\\'t care if theypay a fortune for mediocre software.  It\\'s not their money.  Theyjust want to buy from a supplier who seems safe—a company withan established name, confident salesmen, impressive offices, andsoftware that conforms to all the current fashions.  Not necessarilya company that will deliver so much as one that, if they do let youdown, will still seem to have been a prudent choice.  So companieshave evolved to fill that niche.A recruiter at a big company is in much the same position as someonebuying technology for one.  If someone went to Stanford and is notobviously insane, they\\'re probably a safe bet.  And a safe bet isenough.  No one ever measures recruiters by the later performanceof people they turn down.I\\'m not saying, of course, that elite colleges have evolved to preyupon the weaknesses of large organizations the way enterprisesoftware companies have.  But they work as if they had.  In additionto the power of the brand name, graduates of elite colleges havetwo critical qualities that plug right into the way large organizationswork.  They\\'re good at doing what they\\'re asked, since that\\'s whatit takes to please the adults who judge you at seventeen.  Andhaving been to an elite college makes them more confident.Back in the days when people might spend their whole career at onebig company, these qualities must have been very valuable.  Graduatesof elite colleges would have been capable, yet amenable to authority.And since individual performance is so hard to measure in largeorganizations, their own confidence would have been the startingpoint for their reputation.Things are very different in the new world of startups.  We couldn\\'tsave someone from the market\\'s judgement even if we wanted to.  Andbeing charming and confident counts for nothing with users.  Allusers care about is whether you make something they like.  If youdon\\'t, you\\'re dead.Knowing that test is coming makes us work a lot harder to get theright answers than anyone would if they were merely hiring people.We can\\'t afford to have any illusions about the predictors ofsuccess.  And what we\\'ve found is that the variation between schoolsis so much smaller than the variation between individuals that it\\'snegligible by comparison.  We can learn more about someone in thefirst minute of talking to them than by knowing where they went toschool.It seems obvious when you put it that way.  Look at the individual,not where they went to college.  But that\\'s a weaker statement thanthe idea I began with, that it doesn\\'t matter much where a givenindividual goes to college.  Don\\'t you learn things at the bestschools that you wouldn\\'t learn at lesser places?Apparently not.  Obviously you can\\'t prove this in the case of asingle individual, but you can tell from aggregate evidence: youcan\\'t, without asking them, distinguish people who went to oneschool from those who went to another three times as far down theUS Newslist.Try it and see.How can this be?  Because how much you learn in college depends alot more on you than the college.  A determined party animal canget through the best school without learning anything.  And someonewith a real thirst for knowledge will be able to find a few smartpeople to learn from at a school that isn\\'t prestigious at all.The other students are the biggest advantage of going to an elitecollege; you learn more from them than the professors.  Butyou should be able to reproduce this at most colleges if you makea conscious effort to find smart friends.  Atmost colleges you can find at least a handful of other smart students,and most people have only a handful of close friends in collegeanyway.The odds of finding smart professors are even better.The curve for faculty is a lot flatter than for students, especiallyin math and the hard sciences; you have to go pretty far down thelist of colleges before you stop finding smart professors in themath department.So it\\'s not surprising that we\\'ve found the relative prestige ofdifferent colleges useless in judging individuals.  There\\'s a lotof randomness in how colleges select people, and what they learnthere depends much more on them than the college.  Between thesetwo sources of variation, the college someone went to doesn\\'t meana lot.  It is to some degree a predictor of ability, but so weakthat we regard it mainly as a source of error and try consciouslyto ignore it.I doubt what we\\'ve discovered is an anomaly specific to startups.Probably people have always overestimated the importance of whereone goes to college.  We\\'re just finally able to measure it.The unfortunate thing is not just that people are judged by such asuperficial test, but that so many judge themselves by it.  A lotof people, probably the majority of people in America, havesome amount of insecurity about where, or whether, they went tocollege.  The tragedy of the situation is that by far the greatestliability of not having gone to the college you\\'d have liked isyour own feeling that you\\'re thereby lacking something.  Collegesare a bit like exclusive clubs in this respect.  There is only onereal advantage to being a member of most exclusive clubs: you knowyou wouldn\\'t be missing much if you weren\\'t.  When you\\'re excluded,you can only imagine the advantages of being an insider.  Butinvariably they\\'re larger in your imagination than in real life.So it is with colleges.  Colleges differ, but they\\'re nothing likethe stamp of destiny so many imagine them to be.  People aren\\'twhat some admissions officer decides about them at seventeen.They\\'re what they make themselves.Indeed, the great advantage of not caring where people went tocollege is not just that you can stop judging them (and yourself)by superficial measures, but that you can focus instead on whatreally matters.  What matters is what you make of yourself.  I think that\\'s what weshould tell kids.  Their job isn\\'t to get good grades so they canget into a good college, but to learn and do.  And not just becausethat\\'s more rewarding than worldly success.  That will increasinglybethe route to worldly success.'},\n",

       "  'date': 'June 2013',\n",
       "  'essay_text': '(This talk was written for an audience of investors.)Y Combinator has now funded 564 startups including the currentbatch, which has 53.  The total valuation of the 287 that havevaluations (either by raising an equity round, getting acquired,or dying) is about $11.7 billion, and the 511 prior to the currentbatch have collectively raised about $1.7 billion.As usual those numbers are dominated by a few big winners.  The top10 startups account for 8.6 of that 11.7 billion.  But there is apeloton of younger startups behind them.  There are about 40 morethat have a shot at being really big.Things got a little out of hand last summer when we had 84 companiesin the batch, so we tightened up our filter to decrease the batchsize.Several journalists have tried to interpret that asevidence for some macro story they were telling, but the reason hadnothing to do with any external trend.  The reason was that wediscovered we were using an n² algorithm, and we needed to buytime to fix it.  Fortunately we\\'ve come up with several techniquesfor sharding YC, and the problem now seems to be fixed.  With a newmore scaleable model and only 53 companies, the current batch feelslike a walk in the park.  I\\'d guess we can grow another 2 or 3xbefore hitting the next bottleneck.One consequence of funding such a large number of startups is thatwe see trends early.  And since fundraising is one of the mainthings we help startups with, we\\'re in a good position to noticetrends in investing.I\\'m going to take a shot at describing where these trends areleading.  Let\\'s start with the most basic question: will the futurebe better or worse than the past?  Will investors, in the aggregate,make more money or less?I think more.  There are multiple forces at work, some of whichwill decrease returns, and some of which will increase them.  Ican\\'t predict for sure which forces will prevail, but I\\'ll describethem and you can decide for yourself.There are two big forces driving change in startup funding: it\\'sbecoming cheaper to start a startup, and startups are becoming amore normal thing to do.When I graduated from college in 1986, there were essentially twooptions: get a job or go to grad school.  Now there\\'s a third: startyour own company.That\\'s a big change.  In principle it was possible to start yourown company in 1986 too, but it didn\\'t seem like a real possibility.It seemed possible to start a consulting company, or a niche productcompany, but it didn\\'t seem possible to start a company that wouldbecome big.That kind of change, from 2 paths to 3, is the sort of big socialshift that only happens once every few generations.  I think we\\'restill at the beginning of this one.  It\\'s hard to predict how biga deal it will be.  As big a deal as the Industrial Revolution?Maybe.  Probably not.  But it will be a big enough deal that ittakes almost everyone by surprise, because those big social shiftsalways do.One thing we can say for sure is that there will be a lot morestartups.  The monolithic, hierarchical companies of the mid 20thcentury are beingreplacedby networksof smaller companies.  This process is not just something happeningnow in Silicon Valley.  It started decades ago, and it\\'s happeningas far afield as the car industry.  It has a long way to run.The other big driver of change is that startups are becoming cheaperto start.  And in fact the two forces are related: the decreasingcost of starting a startup is one of the reasons startups arebecoming a more normal thing to do.The fact that startups need less money means founders will increasinglyhave the upper hand over investors.  You still need just as muchof their energy and imagination, but they don\\'t need as much ofyour money.  Because founders have the upper hand, they\\'ll retainan increasingly large share of the stock in, andcontrol of, theircompanies.  Which means investors will get less stock and lesscontrol.Does that mean investors will make less money?  Not necessarily,because there will be more good startups.  The total amount ofdesirable startup stock available to investors will probably increase,because the number of desirable startups will probably grow fasterthan the percentage they sell to investors shrinks.There\\'s a rule of thumb in the VC business that there are about 15companies a year that will be really successful.  Although a lotof investors unconsciously treat this number as if it were somesort of cosmological constant, I\\'m certain it isn\\'t.   There areprobably limits on the rate at which technology can develop, butthat\\'s not the limiting factor now.  If it were, each successfulstartup would be founded the month it became possible, and that isnot the case. Right now the limiting factor on the number of bighits is the number of sufficiently good founders starting companies,and that number can and will increase.  There are still a lot ofpeople who\\'d make great founders who never end up starting a company.You can see that from how randomly some of the most successfulstartups got started.  So many of the biggest startups almost didn\\'thappen that there must be a lot of equally good startups thatactually didn\\'t happen.There might be 10x or even 50x more good founders out there.  Asmore of them go ahead and start startups, those 15 big hits a yearcould easily become 50 or even 100.What about returns, though?  Are we heading for a world in whichreturns will be pinched by increasingly high valuations?  I thinkthe top firms will actually make more money than they have in thepast.  High returns don\\'t come from investing at low valuations.They come from investing in the companies that do really well.  Soif there are more of those to be had each year, the best pickersshould have more hits.This means there should be more variability in the VC business.The firms that can recognize and attract the best startups will doeven better, because there will be more of them to recognize andattract.  Whereas the bad firms will get the leftovers, as they donow, and yet pay a higher price for them.Nor do I think it will be a problem that founders keep control oftheir companies for longer.  The empirical evidence on that isalready clear: investors make more money as founders\\' bitches thantheir bosses.  Though somewhat humiliating, this is actually goodnews for investors, because it takes less time to serve foundersthan to micromanage them.What about angels?  I think there is a lot of opportunity there.It used to suck to be an angel investor.  You couldn\\'t get accessto the best deals, unless you got lucky like Andy Bechtolsheim, andwhen you did invest in a startup, VCs might try to strip you ofyour stock when they arrived later.  Now an angel can go to somethinglike Demo Day or AngelList and have access to the same deals VCsdo.  And the days when VCs could wash angels out of the cap tableare long gone.I think one of the biggest unexploited opportunities in startupinvesting right now is angel-sized investments made quickly.  Fewinvestors understand the cost that raising money from them imposeson startups.  When the company consists only of the founders,everything grinds to a halt during fundraising, which can easilytake 6 weeks.  The current high cost of fundraising means there isroom for low-cost investors to undercut the rest.  And in thiscontext, low-cost means deciding quickly.  If there were a reputableinvestor who invested $100k on good terms and promised to decideyes or no within 24 hours, they\\'d get access to almost all the bestdeals, because every good startup would approach them first.  Itwould be up to them to pick, because every bad startup would approachthem first too, but at least they\\'d see everything.  Whereas if aninvestor is notorious for taking a long time to make up their mindor negotiating a lot about valuation, founders will save them forlast.  And in the case of the most promising startups, which tendto have an easy time raising money, last can easily become never.Will the number of big hits grow linearly with the total number ofnew startups?  Probably not, for two reasons.  One is that thescariness of starting a startup in the old days was a pretty effectivefilter.  Now that the cost of failing is becoming lower, we shouldexpect founders to do it more.  That\\'s not a bad thing.  It\\'s commonin technology for an innovation that decreases the cost of failureto increase the number of failures and yet leave you net ahead.The other reason the number of big hits won\\'t grow proportionatelyto the number of startups is that there will start to be an increasingnumber of idea clashes.  Although the finiteness of the number ofgood ideas is not the reason there are only 15 big hits a year, thenumber has to be finite, and the more startups there are, the morewe\\'ll see multiple companies doing the same thing at the same time.It will be interesting, in a bad way, if idea clashes become a lotmore common.Mostly because of the increasing number of early failures, the startupbusiness of the future won\\'t simply be the same shape, scaled up.What used to be an obelisk will become a pyramid.  It will be alittle wider at the top, but a lot wider at the bottom.What does that mean for investors?  One thing it means is that therewill be more opportunities for investors at the earliest stage,because that\\'s where the volume of our imaginary solid is growingfastest.  Imagine the obelisk of investors that corresponds tothe obelisk of startups.  As it widens out into a pyramid to matchthe startup pyramid, all the contents are adhering to the top,leaving a vacuum at the bottom.That opportunity for investors mostly means an opportunity for newinvestors, because the degree of risk an existing investor or firmis comfortable taking is one of the hardest things for them tochange.  Different types of investors are adapted to differentdegrees of risk, but each has its specific degree of risk deeplyimprinted on it, not just in the procedures they follow but in thepersonalities of the people who work there.I think the biggest danger for VCs, and also the biggest opportunity,is at the series A stage.  Or rather, what used to be the series Astage before series As turned into de facto series B rounds.Right now, VCs often knowingly invest too much money at the seriesA stage.  They do it because they feel they need to get a big chunkof each series A company to compensate for the opportunity cost ofthe board seat it consumes.  Which means when there is a lot ofcompetition for a deal, the number that moves is the valuation (andthus amount invested) rather than the percentage of the companybeing sold.  Which means, especially in the case of more promisingstartups, that series A investors often make companies take moremoney than they want.Some VCs lie and claim the company really needs that much.  Othersare more candid, and admit their financial models require them toown a certain percentage of each company.  But we all know theamounts being raised in series A rounds are not determined by askingwhat would be best for the companies.  They\\'re determined by VCsstarting from the amount of the company they want to own, and themarket setting the valuation and thus the amount invested.Like a lot of bad things, this didn\\'t happen intentionally.  TheVC business backed into it as their initial assumptions graduallybecame obsolete.  The traditions and financial models of the VCbusiness were established when founders needed investors more.  Inthose days it was natural for founders to sell VCs a big chunk oftheir company in the series A round.  Now founders would prefer tosell less, and VCs are digging in their heels because they\\'re notsure if they can make money buying less than 20% of each series Acompany.The reason I describe this as a danger is that series A investorsare increasingly at odds with the startups they supposedly serve,and that tends to come back to bite you eventually.  The reason Idescribe it as an opportunity is that there is now a lot of potentialenergy built up, as the market has moved away from VCs\\' traditionalbusiness model.  Which means the first VC to break ranks and startto do series A rounds for as much equity as founders want to sell(and with no \"option pool\" that comes only from the founders\\' shares)stands to reap huge benefits.What will happen to the VC business when that happens?  Hell if Iknow.  But I bet that particular firm will end up ahead.  If onetop-tier VC firm started to do series A rounds that started fromthe amount the company needed to raise and let the percentageacquired vary with the market, instead of the other way around,they\\'d instantly get almost all the best startups.  And that\\'s wherethe money is.You can\\'t fight market forces forever.  Over the last decade we\\'veseen the percentage of the company sold in series A rounds creepinexorably downward.  40% used to be common.  Now VCs are fightingto hold the line at 20%.  But I am daily waiting for the line tocollapse.  It\\'s going to happen.  You may as well anticipate it,and look bold.Who knows, maybe VCs will make more money by doing the right thing.It wouldn\\'t be the first time that happened.  Venture capital is abusiness where occasional big successes generate hundredfold returns.How much confidence can you really have in financial models forsomething like that anyway?  Thebig successes only have to get a tiny bit less occasional tocompensate for a 2x decrease in the stock sold in series A rounds.If you want to find new opportunities for investing, look for thingsfounders complain about.  Founders are your customers, and thethings they complain about are unsatisfied demand.  I\\'ve given twoexamples of things founders complain about most—investors whotake too long to make up their minds, and excessive dilution inseries A rounds—so those are good places to look now.  Butthe more general recipe is: do something founders want.'},\n",

I was trying to makeit efficient.  I didn\\'t want to waste people\\'s time telling themthings they already knew.  It\\'s more efficient just to give themthe diffs.  But I suppose that\\'s bound to yield an alarming book.EdisonsThere\\'s no controversy about which idea is most controversial:the suggestion that variation in wealth might not be as big aproblem as we think.I didn\\'t say in the book that variation in wealth was in itself agood thing.  I said in some situations it might be a sign of goodthings.  A throbbing headache is not a good thing, but it can bea sign of a good thing-- for example, that you\\'re recoveringconsciousness after being hit on the head.Variation in wealth can be a sign of variation in productivity.(In a society of one, they\\'re identical.) Andthatis almost certainly a good thing: if your society has no variationin productivity, it\\'s probably not because everyone is ThomasEdison.  It\\'s probably because you have no Thomas Edisons.In a low-tech society you don\\'t see much variation in productivity.If you have a tribe of nomads collecting sticks for a fire, howmuch more productive is the best stick gatherer going to be thanthe worst?  A factor of two?  Whereas when you hand people a complex toollike a computer, the variation in what they can do withit is enormous.That\\'s not a new idea.  Fred Brooks wrote about it in 1974, andthe study he quoted was published in 1968.  But I think heunderestimated the variation between programmers.  He wrote about productivity in linesof code:  the best programmers can solve a given problem in a tenththe time.  But what if the problem isn\\'t given? In programming, asin many fields, the hard part isn\\'t solving problems, but decidingwhat problems to solve.  Imagination is hard to measure, butin practice it dominates the kind of productivity that\\'s measuredin lines of code.Productivity varies in any field, but there are few in which itvaries so much.  The variation between programmersis so great that it becomes a difference in kind.  I don\\'tthink this is something intrinsic to programming, though.  In every field,technology magnifies differences in productivity.  I think what\\'shappening in programming is just that we have a lot of technologicalleverage.  But in every field the lever is getting longer, so thevariation we see is something that more and more fields will seeas time goes on.  And the success of companies, and countries, willdepend increasingly on how they deal with it.If variation in productivity increases with technology, then thecontribution of the most productive individuals will not only bedisproportionately large, but will actually grow with time.  Whenyou reach the point where 90% of a group\\'s output is created by 1%of its members, you lose big if something (whether Viking raids,or central planning) drags their productivity down to the average.If we want to get the most out of them, we need to understand theseespecially productive people.  What motivates them?  What do theyneed to do their jobs?  How do you recognize them? How do youget them to come and work for you?  And then of course there\\'s thequestion, how do you become one?More than MoneyI know a handful of super-hackers, so I sat down and thought aboutwhat they have in common.  Their defining quality is probably thatthey really love to program.  Ordinary programmers write code to paythe bills.  Great hackers think of it as something they do for fun,and which they\\'re delighted to find people will pay them for.Great programmers are sometimes said to be indifferent to money.This isn\\'t quite true.  It is true that all they really care aboutis doing interesting work.  But if you make enough money, you getto work on whatever you want, and for that reason hackersareattracted by the idea of making really large amounts of money.But as long as they still have to show up for work every day, theycare more about what they do there than how much they get paid forit.Economically, this is a fact of the greatest importance, becauseit means you don\\'t have to pay great hackers anything like whatthey\\'re worth.  A great programmer might be ten or a hundred timesas productive as an ordinary one, but he\\'ll consider himself luckyto get paid three times as much.  As I\\'ll explain later, this ispartly because great hackers don\\'t know how good they are.  Butit\\'s also because money is not the main thing they want.What do hackers want?  Like all craftsmen, hackers like good tools.In fact, that\\'s an understatement.  Good hackers find it unbearableto use bad tools.  They\\'ll simply refuse to work on projects withthe wrong infrastructure.At a startup I once worked for, one of the things pinned up on ourbulletin board was an ad from IBM.  It was a picture of an AS400,and the headline read, I think, \"hackers despiseit.\\'\\' [1]When you decide what infrastructure to use for a project, you\\'renot just making a technical decision.  You\\'re also making a socialdecision, and this may be the more important of the two.  Forexample, if your company wants to write some software, it mightseem a prudent choice to write it in Java.  But when you choose alanguage, you\\'re also choosing a community.  The programmers you\\'llbe able to hire to work on a Java project won\\'t be assmartas theones you could get to work on a project written in Python.And the quality of your hackers probably matters more than thelanguage you choose.  Though, frankly, the fact that good hackersprefer Python to Java should tell you something about the relativemerits of those languages.Business types prefer the most popular languages because they viewlanguages as standards. They don\\'t want to bet the company onBetamax.  The thing about languages, though, is that they\\'re notjust standards.  If you have to move bits over a network, by allmeans use TCP/IP.  But a programming language isn\\'t just a format.A programming language is a medium of expression.I\\'ve read that Java has just overtaken Cobol as the most popularlanguage.  As a standard, you couldn\\'t wish for more.  But as amedium of expression, you could do a lot better.  Of all the greatprogrammers I can think of, I know of only one who would voluntarilyprogram in Java.  And of all the great programmers I can think ofwho don\\'t work for Sun, on Java, I know of zero.Great hackers also generally insist on using open source software.Not just because it\\'s better, but because it gives them more control.Good hackers insist on control.  This is part of what makes themgood hackers:  when something\\'s broken, they need to fix it.  Youwant them to feel this way about the software they\\'re writing foryou.  You shouldn\\'t be surprised when they feel the same way aboutthe operating system.A couple years ago a venture capitalist friend told me about a newstartup he was involved with.  It sounded promising.  But the nexttime I talked to him, he said they\\'d decided to build their softwareon Windows NT, and had just hired a very experienced NT developerto be their chief technical officer.  When I heard this, I thought,these guys are doomed.  One, the CTO couldn\\'t be a first ratehacker, because to become an eminent NT developer he would havehad to use NT voluntarily, multiple times, and I couldn\\'t imaginea great hacker doing that; and two, even if he was good, he\\'d havea hard time hiring anyone good to work for him if the project hadto be built on NT. [2]The Final FrontierAfter software, the most important tool to a hacker is probablyhis office.  Big companies think the function of office space is to expressrank.  But hackers use their offices for more than that: theyuse their office as a place to think in.  And if you\\'re a technologycompany, their thoughts are your product.  So making hackers workin a noisy, distracting environment is like having a paint factorywhere the air is full of soot.The cartoon strip Dilbert has a lot to say about cubicles, and withgood reason.  All the hackers I know despise them.  The mere prospectof being interrupted is enough to prevent hackers from working onhard problems.  If you want to get real work done in an office withcubicles, you have two options: work at home, or come in early orlate or on a weekend, when no one else is there.  Don\\'t companiesrealize this is a sign that something is broken?  An officeenvironment is supposed to be something thathelpsyou work, not something you work despite.Companies like Cisco are proud that everyone there has a cubicle,even the CEO.  But they\\'re not so advanced as they think; obviouslythey still view office space as a badge of rank.  Note too thatCisco is famous for doing very little product development in house.They get new technology by buying the startups that created it-- wherepresumably the hackers did have somewhere quiet to work.One big company that understands what hackers need is Microsoft.I once saw a recruiting ad for Microsoft with a big picture of adoor.  Work for us, the premise was, and we\\'ll give you a place towork where you can actually get work done.   And you know, Microsoftis remarkable among big companies in that they are able to developsoftware in house.  Not well, perhaps, but well enough.If companies want hackers to be productive, they should look atwhat they do at home.  At home, hackers can arrange things themselvesso they can get the most done.  And when they work at home, hackersdon\\'t work in noisy, open spaces; they work in rooms with doors.  Theywork in cosy, neighborhoody places with people around and somewhereto walk when they need to mull something over, instead of in glassboxes set in acres of parking lots.  They have a sofa they can takea nap on when they feel tired, instead of sitting in a coma attheir desk, pretending to work.  There\\'s no crew of people withvacuum cleaners that roars through every evening during the primehacking hours.  There are no meetings or, God forbid, corporateretreats or team-building exercises.  And when you look at whatthey\\'re doing on that computer, you\\'ll find it reinforces what Isaid earlier about tools.  They may have to use Java and Windowsat work, but at home, where they can choose for themselves, you\\'remore likely to find them using Perl and Linux.Indeed, these statistics about Cobol or Java being the most popularlanguage can be misleading.  What we ought to look at, if we wantto know what tools are best, is what hackers choose when they canchoose freely-- that is, in projects of their own.  When you askthat question, you find that open source operating systems alreadyhave a dominant market share, and the number one language is probablyPerl.InterestingAlong with good tools, hackers want interesting projects.  Whatmakes a project interesting?  Well, obviously overtly sexyapplications like stealth planes or special effects software wouldbe interesting to work on.  But any application can be interestingif it poses novel technical challenges.  So it\\'s hard to predictwhich problems hackers will like, because some becomeinteresting only when the people working on them discover a newkind of solution.  Before ITA(who wrote the software inside Orbitz),the people working on airline fare searches probably thought itwas one of the most boring applications imaginable.  But ITA madeit interesting byredefiningthe problem in a more ambitious way.I think the same thing happened at Google.  When Google was founded,the conventional wisdom among the so-called portals was that searchwas boring and unimportant.  But the guys at Google didn\\'t thinksearch was boring, and that\\'s why they do it so well.This is an area where managers can make a difference.  Like a parentsaying to a child, I bet you can\\'t clean up your whole room inten minutes, a good manager can sometimes redefine a problem as amore interesting one.  Steve Jobs seems to be particularly good atthis, in part simply by having high standards.  There were a lotof small, inexpensive computers before the Mac.  He redefined theproblem as: make one that\\'s beautiful.  And that probably drovethe developers harder than any carrot or stick could.They certainly delivered.  When the Mac first appeared, you didn\\'teven have to turn it on to know it would be good; you could tellfrom the case.  A few weeks ago I was walking along the street inCambridge, and in someone\\'s trash I saw what appeared to be a Maccarrying case.  I looked inside, and there was a Mac SE.  I carriedit home and plugged it in, and it booted.  The happy Macintoshface, and then the finder.  My God, it was so simple.  It was justlike ... Google.Hackers like to work for people with high standards.  But it\\'s notenough just to be exacting.  You have to insist on the right things.Which usually means that you have to be a hacker yourself.  I\\'veseen occasional articles about how to manage programmers.  Reallythere should be two articles: one about what to do ifyou are yourself a programmer, and one about what to do if you\\'re not.  And the second could probably be condensed into two words:  give up.The problem is not so much the day to day management.  Really goodhackers are practically self-managing.  The problem is, if you\\'renot a hacker, you can\\'t tell who the good hackers are.  A similarproblem explains why American cars are so ugly.  I call it thedesign paradox.You might think that you could make your productsbeautiful just by hiring a great designer to design them.  But ifyou yourself don\\'t have goodtaste, how are you going to recognizea good designer?  By definition you can\\'t tell from his portfolio.And you can\\'t go by the awards he\\'s won or the jobs he\\'s had,because in design, as in most fields, those tend to be driven byfashion and schmoozing, with actual ability a distant third.There\\'s no way around it:  you can\\'t manage a process intended toproduce beautiful things without knowing what beautiful is.  Americancars are ugly because American car companies are run by people withbad taste.Many people in this country think of taste as something elusive,or even frivolous.  It is neither.  To drive design, a manager mustbe the most demanding user of a company\\'s products.  And if youhave really good taste, you can, as Steve Jobs does, make satisfyingyou the kind of problem that good people like to work on.Nasty Little ProblemsIt\\'s pretty easy to say what kinds of problems are not interesting:those where instead of solving a few big, clear, problems, you haveto solve a lot of nasty little ones.  One of the worst kinds ofprojects is writing an interface to a piece of software that\\'sfull of bugs.  Another is when you have to customizesomething for an individual client\\'s complex and ill-defined needs.To hackers these kinds of projects are the death of a thousandcuts.The distinguishing feature of nasty little problems is that youdon\\'t learn anything from them.   Writing a compiler is interestingbecause it teaches you what a compiler is.  But writing an interfaceto a buggy piece of software doesn\\'t teach you anything, because thebugs are random.  [3] So it\\'s not just fastidiousness that makes goodhackers avoid nasty little problems.  It\\'s more a question ofself-preservation.  Working on nasty little problems makes youstupid.  Good hackers avoid it for the same reason models avoidcheeseburgers.Of course some problems inherently have this character.  And becauseof supply and demand, they pay especially well.  So a company thatfound a way to get great hackers to work on tedious problems wouldbe very successful.  How would you do it?One place this happens is in startups.  At our startup we had Robert Morris working as a system administrator.  That\\'s like having theRolling Stones play at a bar mitzvah.  You can\\'t hire that kind oftalent.  But people will do any amount of drudgery for companiesof which they\\'re the founders.  [4]Bigger companies solve the problem by partitioning the company.They get smart people to work for them by establishing a separateR&D department where employees don\\'t have to work directly oncustomers\\' nasty little problems. [5] In this model, the researchdepartment functions like a mine. They produce new ideas; maybethe rest of the company will be able to use them.You may not have to go to this extreme.Bottom-up programmingsuggests another way to partition the company: have the smart peoplework as toolmakers.  If your company makes software to do x, haveone group that builds tools for writing software of that type, andanother that uses these tools to write the applications.  This wayyou might be able to get smart people to write 99% of your code,but still keep them almost as insulated from users as they wouldbe in a traditional research department.  The toolmakers would haveusers, but they\\'d only be the company\\'s own developers.  [6]If Microsoft used this approach, their software wouldn\\'t be so fullof security holes, because the less smart people writing the actualapplications wouldn\\'t be doing low-level stuff like allocatingmemory.  Instead of writing Word directly in C, they\\'d be pluggingtogether big Lego blocks of Word-language.  (Duplo, I believe, isthe technical term.)ClumpingAlong with interesting problems, what good hackers like is othergood hackers.  Great hackers tend to clump together-- sometimesspectacularly so, as at Xerox Parc.   So you won\\'t attract goodhackers in linear proportion to how good an environment you createfor them.  The tendency to clump means it\\'s more like the squareof the environment.  So it\\'s winner take all.  At any given time,there are only about ten or twenty places where hackers most want towork, and if you aren\\'t one of them, you won\\'t just have fewergreat hackers, you\\'ll have zero.Having great hackers is not, by itself, enough to make a companysuccessful.  It works well for Google and ITA, which are two ofthe hot spots right now, but it didn\\'t help Thinking Machines orXerox.  Sun had a good run for a while, but their business modelis a down elevator.  In that situation, even the best hackers can\\'tsave you.I think, though, that all other things being equal, a company thatcan attract great hackers will have a huge advantage.  There arepeople who would disagree with this.  When we were making the roundsof venture capital firms in the 1990s, several told us that softwarecompanies didn\\'t win by writing great software, but through brand,and dominating channels, and doing the right deals.They really seemed to believe this, and I think I know why.  Ithink what a lot of VCs are looking for, at least unconsciously,is the next Microsoft.  And of course if Microsoft is your model,you shouldn\\'t be looking for companies that hope to win by writinggreat software.  But VCs are mistaken to look for the next Microsoft,because no startup can be the next Microsoft unless some othercompany is prepared to bend over at just the right moment and bethe next IBM.It\\'s a mistake to use Microsoft as a model, because their wholeculture derives from that one lucky break.  Microsoft is a bad datapoint.  If you throw them out, you find that good products do tendto win in the market.  What VCs should be looking for is the nextApple, or the next Google.I think Bill Gates knows this.  What worries him about Google isnot the power of their brand, but the fact that they havebetter hackers. [7]RecognitionSo who are the great hackers?  How do you know when you meet one?That turns out to be very hard.  Even hackers can\\'t tell.  I\\'mpretty sure now that my friend Trevor Blackwell is a great hacker.You may have read on Slashdot how he made hisown Segway.  Theremarkable thing about this project was that he wrote all thesoftware in one day (in Python, incidentally).For Trevor, that\\'spar for the course.  But when I first met him, I thought he was acomplete idiot.  He was standing in Robert Morris\\'s office babblingat him about something or other, and I remember standing behindhim making frantic gestures at Robert to shoo this nut out of hisoffice so we could go to lunch.  Robert says he misjudged Trevorat first too.  Apparently when Robert first met him, Trevor hadjust begun a new scheme that involved writing down everything aboutevery aspect of his life on a stack of index cards, which he carriedwith him everywhere.  He\\'d also just arrived from Canada, and hada strong Canadian accent and a mullet.The problem is compounded by the fact that hackers, despite theirreputation for social obliviousness, sometimes put a good deal ofeffort into seeming smart.  When I was in grad school I used tohang around the MIT AI Lab occasionally. It was kind of intimidatingat first.  Everyone there spoke so fast.  But after a while Ilearned the trick of speaking fast.  You don\\'t have to think anyfaster; just use twice as many words to say everything.With this amount of noise in the signal, it\\'s hard to tell goodhackers when you meet them.  I can\\'t tell, even now.  You alsocan\\'t tell from their resumes.  It seems like the only way to judgea hacker is to work with him on something.And this is the reason that high-tech areas only happen around universities.  The active ingredienthere is not so much the professors as the students.  Startups grow uparound universities because universities bring together promising youngpeople and make them work on the same projects.  Thesmart ones learn who the other smart ones are, and togetherthey cook up new projects of their own.Because you can\\'t tell a great hacker except by working with him,hackers themselves can\\'t tell how good they are.  This is true toa degree in most fields.  I\\'ve found that people whoare great at something are not so much convinced of their owngreatness as mystified at why everyone else seems so incompetent.But it\\'s particularly hard for hackers to know how good they are,because it\\'s hard to compare their work.  This is easier in mostother fields.  In the hundred meters, you know in 10 seconds who\\'sfastest.  Even in math there seems to be a general consensus aboutwhich problems are hard to solve, and what constitutes a goodsolution.  But hacking is like writing.  Who can say which of twonovels is better?  Certainly not the authors.With hackers, at least, other hackers can tell.  That\\'s because,unlike novelists, hackers collaborate on projects.  When you getto hit a few difficult problems over the net at someone, you learnpretty quickly how hard they hit them back.  But hackers can\\'twatch themselves at work.  So if you ask a great hacker how goodhe is, he\\'s almost certain to reply, I don\\'t know.  He\\'s not justbeing modest.  He really doesn\\'t know.And none of us know, except about people we\\'ve actually workedwith.  Which puts us in a weird situation: we don\\'t know who ourheroes should be.  The hackers who become famous tend to becomefamous by random accidents of PR.  Occasionally I need to give anexample of a great hacker, and I never know who to use.  The firstnames that come to mind always tend to be people I know personally,but it seems lame to use them.  So, I think, maybe I should sayRichard Stallman, or Linus Torvalds, or Alan Kay, or someone famouslike that.  But I have no idea if these guys are great hackers.I\\'ve never worked with them on anything.If there is a Michael Jordan of hacking, no one knows, includinghim.CultivationFinally, the question the hackers have all been wondering about:how do you become a great hacker?  I don\\'t know if it\\'s possibleto make yourself into one.  But it\\'s certainly possible to do thingsthat make you stupid, and if you can make yourself stupid, youcan probably make yourself smart too.The key to being a good hacker may be to work on what you like.When I think about the great hackers I know, one thing they havein common is the extremedifficultyof making them work on anything theydon\\'t want to.  I don\\'t know if this is cause or effect; it may beboth.To do something well you have toloveit.  So to the extent youcan preserve hacking as something you love, you\\'re likely to do itwell.  Try to keep the sense of wonder you had about programming atage 14.  If you\\'re worried that your current job is rotting yourbrain, it probably is.The best hackers tend to be smart, of course, but that\\'s true ina lot of fields.  Is there some quality that\\'s unique to hackers?I asked some friends, and the number one thing they mentioned wascuriosity.  I\\'d always supposed that all smart people were curious--that curiosity was simply the first derivative of knowledge.  Butapparently hackers are particularly curious, especially about howthings work.  That makes sense, because programs are in effectgiant descriptions of how things work.Several friends mentioned hackers\\' ability to concentrate-- theirability, as one put it, to \"tune out everything outside their ownheads.\\'\\'  I\\'ve certainly noticed this.  And I\\'ve heard several hackers say that after drinking even half a beer they can\\'t program atall.   So maybe hacking does require some special ability to focus.Perhaps great hackers can load a large amount of context into theirhead, so that when they look at a line of code, they see not justthat line but the whole program around it.  John McPheewrote that Bill Bradley\\'s success as a basketball player was duepartly to his extraordinary peripheral vision.  \"Perfect\\'\\' eyesightmeans about 47 degrees of vertical peripheral vision.  Bill Bradleyhad 70; he could see the basket when he was looking at the floor.Maybe great hackers have some similar inborn ability.  (I cheat byusing a verydenselanguage, which shrinks the court.)This could explain the disconnect over cubicles.  Maybe the peoplein charge of facilities, not having any concentration to shatter,have no idea that working in a cubicle feels to a hacker like havingone\\'s brain in a blender.  (Whereas Bill, if the rumors of autismare true, knows all too well.)One difference I\\'ve noticed between great hackers and smart peoplein general is that hackers are morepolitically incorrect.  To theextent there is a secret handshake among good hackers, it\\'s when theyknow one another well enough to express opinions that would getthem stoned to death by the general public.  And I can see whypolitical incorrectness would be a useful quality in programming.Programs are very complex and, at least in the hands of goodprogrammers, very fluid.  In such situations it\\'s helpful to havea habit of questioning assumptions.Can you cultivate these qualities?  I don\\'t know.  But you can atleast not repress them.  So here is my best shot at a recipe.  Ifit is possible to make yourself into a great hacker, the way to doit may be to make the following deal with yourself: you never haveto work on boring projects (unless your family will starve otherwise),and in return, you\\'ll never allow yourself to do a half-assed job.All the great hackers I know seem to have made that deal, thoughperhaps none of them had any choice in the matter.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'Is There Such a Thing as Good Taste?',\n",
       "  'date': 'November 2021',\n",
       "  'essay_text': '(This essay is derived from a talk at the Cambridge Union.)When I was a kid, I\\'d have said there wasn\\'t. My father told me so.Some people like some things, and other people like other things,and who\\'s to say who\\'s right?It seemed so obvious that there was no such thing as good tastethat it was only through indirect evidence that I realized my fatherwas wrong. And that\\'s what I\\'m going to give you here: a proof byreductio ad absurdum. If we start from the premise that there\\'s nosuch thing as good taste, we end up with conclusions that areobviously false, and therefore the premise must be wrong.We\\'d better start by saying what good taste is. There\\'s a narrowsense in which it refers to aesthetic judgements and a broader onein which it refers to preferences of any kind. The strongest proofwould be to show that taste exists in the narrowest sense, so I\\'mgoing to talk about taste in art. You have better taste than me ifthe art you like is better than the art I like.If there\\'s no such thing as good taste, then there\\'s no such thingasgood art. Because if there is such athing as good art, it\\'seasy to tell which of two people has better taste. Show them a lotof works by artists they\\'ve never seen before and ask them tochoose the best, and whoever chooses the better art has bettertaste.So if you want to discard the concept of good taste, you also haveto discard the concept of good art. And that means you have todiscard the possibility of people being good at making it. Whichmeans there\\'s no way for artists to be good at their jobs. And notjust visual artists, but anyone who is in any sense an artist. Youcan\\'t have good actors, or novelists, or composers, or dancerseither. You can have popular novelists, but not good ones.We don\\'t realize how far we\\'d have to go if we discarded the conceptof good taste, because we don\\'t even debate the most obvious cases.But it doesn\\'t just mean we can\\'t say which of two famous paintersis better. It means we can\\'t say that any painter is better than arandomly chosen eight year old.That was how I realized my father was wrong. I started studyingpainting. And it was just like other kinds of work I\\'d done: youcould do it well, or badly, and if you tried hard, you could getbetter at it. And it was obvious that Leonardo and Bellini weremuch better at it than me. That gap between us was not imaginary.They were so good. And if they could be good, then art could begood, and there was such a thing as good taste after all.Now that I\\'ve explained how to show there is such a thing as goodtaste, I should also explain why people think there isn\\'t. Thereare two reasons. One is that there\\'s always so much disagreementabout taste. Most people\\'s response to art is a tangle of unexaminedimpulses. Is the artist famous? Is the subject attractive? Is thisthe sort of art they\\'re supposed to like? Is it hanging in a famousmuseum, or reproduced in a big, expensive book? In practice mostpeople\\'s response to art is dominated by such extraneous factors.And the people who do claim to have good taste are so often mistaken.The paintings admired by the so-called experts in one generationare often so different from those admired a few generations later.It\\'s easy to conclude there\\'s nothing real there at all. It\\'s onlywhen you isolate this force, for example by trying to paint andcomparing your work to Bellini\\'s, that you can see that it does infact exist.The other reason people doubt that art can be good is that theredoesn\\'t seem to be any room in the art for this goodness. Theargument goes like this. Imagine several people looking at a workof art and judging how good it is. If being good art really is aproperty of objects, it should be in the object somehow. But itdoesn\\'t seem to be; it seems to be something happening in the headsof each of the observers. And if they disagree, how do you choosebetween them?The solution to this puzzle is to realize that the purpose of artis to work on its human audience, and humans have a lot in common.And to the extent the things an object acts upon respond in thesame way, that\\'s arguably what it means for the object to have thecorresponding property. If everything a particle interacts withbehaves as if the particle had a mass ofm, then it has a mass ofm. So the distinction between \"objective\" and \"subjective\" is notbinary, but a matter of degree, depending on how much the subjectshave in common. Particles interacting with one another are at onepole, but people interacting with art are not all the way at theother; their reactions aren\\'trandom.Because people\\'s responses to art aren\\'t random, art can be designedto operate on people, and be good or bad depending on how effectivelyit does so. Much as a vaccine can be. If someone were talking aboutthe ability of a vaccine to confer immunity, it would seem veryfrivolous to object that conferring immunity wasn\\'t really a propertyof vaccines, because acquiring immunity is something that happensin the immune system of each individual person. Sure, people\\'simmune systems vary, and a vaccine that worked on one might notwork on another, but that doesn\\'t make it meaningless to talk aboutthe effectiveness of a vaccine.The situation with art is messier, of course. You can\\'t measureeffectiveness by simply taking a vote, as you do with vaccines.You have to imagine the responses of subjects with a deep knowledgeof art, and enough clarity of mind to be able to ignore extraneousinfluences like the fame of the artist. And even then you\\'d stillsee some disagreement. People do vary, and judging art is hard,especially recent art. There is definitely not a total order eitherof works or of people\\'s ability to judge them. But there is equallydefinitely a partial order of both. So while it\\'s not possible tohave perfect taste, it is possible to have good taste.'},\n",

       "  'date': 'March 2024',\n",
       "  'essay_text': 'I met the Reddits before we even started Y Combinator. In fact theywere one of the reasons we started it.YC grew out of a talk I gave to the Harvard Computer Society (theundergrad computer club) about how to start a startup. Everyoneelse in the audience was probably local, but Steve and Alexis cameup on the train from the University of Virginia, where they wereseniors. Since they\\'d come so far I agreed to meet them for coffee.They told me about the startup idea we\\'d later fund them to drop:a way to order fast food on your cellphone.This was before smartphones. They\\'d have had to make deals withcell carriers and fast food chains just to get it launched. So itwas not going to happen. It still doesn\\'t exist, 19 years later.But I was impressed with their brains and their energy. In fact Iwas so impressed with them and some of the other people I met atthat talk that I decided to start something to fund them. A fewdays later I told Steve and Alexis that we were starting Y\\xa0Combinator,and encouraged them to apply.That first batch we didn\\'t have any way to identify applicants, sowe made up nicknames for them. The Reddits were the \"Cell foodmuffins.\" \"Muffin\" is a term of endearment Jessica uses for thingslike small dogs and two year olds. So that gives you some idea whatkind of impression Steve and Alexis made in those days. They hadthe look of slightly ruffled surprise that baby birds have.Their idea was bad though. And since we thought then that we werefunding ideas rather than founders, we rejected them. But we feltbad about it. Jessica was sad that we\\'d rejected the muffins. Andit seemed wrong to me to turn down the people we\\'d been inspiredto start YC to fund.I don\\'t think the startup sense of the word \"pivot\" had been inventedyet, but we wanted to fund Steve and Alexis, so if their idea wasbad, they\\'d have to work on something else. And I knew what else.In those days there was a site called Delicious where you couldsave links. It had a page called del.icio.us/popular that listedthe most-saved links, and people were using this page as a de factoReddit. I knew because a lot of the traffic to my site was comingfrom it. There needed to be something like del.icio.us/popular, butdesigned for sharing links instead of being a byproduct of savingthem.So I called Steve and Alexis and said that we liked them, just nottheir idea, so we\\'d fund them if they\\'d work on something else.They were on the train home to Virginia at that point. They got offat the next station and got on the next train north, and by the endof the day were committed to working on what\\'s now called Reddit.They would have liked to call it Snoo, as in \"What snoo?\" Butsnoo.com was too expensive, so they settled for calling the mascotSnoo and picked a name for the site that wasn\\'t registered. Earlyon Reddit was just a provisional name, or so they told me at least,but it\\'s probably too late to change it now.As with all the really great startups, there\\'s an uncannily closematch between the company and the founders. Steve in particular.Reddit has a certain personality — curious, skeptical, ready tobe amused — and that personality is Steve\\'s.Steve will roll his eyes at this, but he\\'s an intellectual; he\\'sinterested in ideas for their own sake. That was how he came to bein that audience in Cambridge in the first place. He knew me becausehe was interested in a programming language I\\'ve written aboutcalled Lisp, and Lisp is one of those languages few people learnexcept out of intellectual curiosity. Steve\\'s kind of vacuum-cleanercuriosity is exactly what you want when you\\'re starting a sitethat\\'s a list of links to literally anything interesting.Steve was not a big fan of authority, so he also liked the idea ofa site without editors. In those days the top forum for programmerswas a site called Slashdot. It was a lot like Reddit, except thestories on the frontpage were chosen by human moderators. And thoughthey did a good job, that one small difference turned out to be abig difference. Being driven by user submissions meant Reddit wasfresher than Slashdot. News there was newer, and users will alwaysgo where the newest news is.I pushed the Reddits to launch fast. A version one didn\\'t need tobe more than a couple hundred lines of code. How could that takemore than a week or two to build? And they did launch comparativelyfast, about three weeks into the first YC batch. The first userswere Steve, Alexis, me, and some of their YC batchmates and collegefriends. It turns out you don\\'t need that many users to collect adecent list of interesting links, especially if you have multipleaccounts per user.Reddit got two more people from their YC batch: Chris Slowe andAaron Swartz, and they too were unusually smart. Chris was justfinishing his PhD in physics at Harvard. Aaron was younger, a collegefreshman, and even more anti-authority than Steve. It\\'s notexaggerating to describe him as a martyr for what authority laterdid to him.Slowly but inexorably Reddit\\'s traffic grew. At first the numberswere so small they were hard to distinguish from background noise.But within a few weeks it was clear that there was a core of realusers returning regularly to the site. And although all kinds ofthings have happened to Reddit the company in the years since,Reddit thesitenever looked back.Reddit the site (and now app) is such a fundamentally useful thingthat it\\'s almost unkillable. Which is why, despite a long stretchafter Steve left when the management strategy ranged from benignneglect to spectacular blunders, traffic just kept growing. Youcan\\'t do that with most companies. Most companies you take your eyeoff the ball for six months and you\\'re in deep trouble. But Redditwas special, and when Steve came back in 2015, I knew the world wasin for a surprise.People thought they had Reddit\\'s number: one of the players inSilicon Valley, but not one of the big ones. But those who knewwhat had been going on behind the scenes knew there was more to thestory than this. If Reddit could grow to the size it had withmanagement that was harmless at best, what could it do if Stevecame back? We now know the answer to that question. Or at least alower bound on the answer. Steve is not out of ideas yet.'},\n",

Reading aboutx doesn\\'t just teach you about x; it also teaches you how to write.Would that matter?

When I was a kid I thought they helped.  I thought theyprotected inventors from having their ideas stolen by big companies.Maybe that was truer in the past, when more things were physical.But regardless of whether patents are in general a good thing, theredo seem to be bad ways of using them.  And since bad uses of patentsseem to be increasing, there is an increasing call for patent reform.The problem with patent reform is that it has to go through thegovernment.  That tends to be slow.  But recently I realized we canalso attack the problem downstream.  As well as pinching off thestream of patents at the point where they\\'re issued, we may in somecases be able to pinch it off at the point where they\\'re used.One way of using patents that clearly does not encourage innovationis when established companies with bad products use patents tosuppress small competitors with good products.  This is the typeof abuse we may be able to decrease without having to go throughthe government.The way to do it is to get the companies that are above pullingthis sort of trick to pledge publicly not to.  Then the ones thatwon\\'t make such a pledge will be very conspicuous.  Potentialemployees won\\'t want to work for them.  And investors, too, willbe able to see that they\\'re the sort of company that competes bylitigation rather than by making good products.Here\\'s the pledge:No first use of software patents against companies with less     than 25 people.I\\'ve deliberately traded precision for brevity.  The patent pledgeis not legally binding.  It\\'s like Google\\'s \"Don\\'t be evil.\" Theydon\\'t define what evil is, but by publicly saying that, they\\'resaying they\\'re willing to be held to a standard that, say, Altriais not.  And though constraining, \"Don\\'t be evil\" has been good forGoogle. Technology companies win by attracting the most productivepeople, and the most productive people are attracted to employerswho hold themselves to a higher standard than the law requires.The patent pledge is in effect a narrower but open source \"Don\\'tbe evil.\"  I encourage every technology company to adopt it.  Ifyou want to help fix patents, encourage your employer to.Already most technology companies wouldn\\'t sink to using patentson startups.  You don\\'t see Google or Facebook suing startups forpatent infringement. They don\\'t need to.  So for the better technologycompanies, the patent pledge requires no change in behavior.  They\\'rejust promising to do what they\\'d do anyway.  And when all thecompanies that won\\'t use patents on startups have said so, theholdouts will be very conspicuous.The patent pledge doesn\\'t fix every problem with patents.  It won\\'tstop patent trolls, for example; they\\'re already pariahs.  But theproblem the patent pledge does fix may be more serious than theproblem of patent trolls.  Patent trolls are just parasites.  Aclumsy parasite may occasionally kill the host, but that\\'s not itsgoal.  Whereas companies that sue startups for patent infringementgenerally do it with explicit goal of keeping their product off themarket.Companies that use patents on startups are attacking innovation atthe root.

       "  'essay_text': 'When we sold our startup in 1998 I suddenly got a lot of money.  Inow had to think about something I hadn\\'t had to think about before:how not to lose it.   I knew it was possible to go from rich topoor, just as it was possible to go from poor to rich.  But whileI\\'d spent a lot of the past several years studying the paths frompoor to rich, I knew practically nothing about the paths from richto poor.  Now, in order to avoid them, I had to learn where theywere.So I started to pay attention to how fortunes are lost.  If you\\'dasked me as a kid how rich people became poor, I\\'d have said byspending all their money.  That\\'s how it happens in books and movies,because that\\'s the colorful way to do it.  But in fact the way mostfortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but throughbad investments.It\\'s hard to spend a fortune without noticing.  Someone with ordinarytastes would find it hard to blow through more than a few tens ofthousands of dollars without thinking \"wow, I\\'m spending a lot ofmoney.\"  Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you can lose amillion dollars (as much as you want, really) in the blink of aneye.In most people\\'s minds, spending money on luxuries sets off alarmsthat making investments doesn\\'t.  Luxuries seem self-indulgent.And unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery,you\\'ve already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leadsto trouble.  Investing bypasses those alarms.  You\\'re not spendingthe money; you\\'re just moving it from one asset to another.  Whichis why people trying to sell you expensive things say \"it\\'s aninvestment.\"The solution is to develop new alarms.  This can be a tricky business,because while the alarms that prevent you from overspending are sobasic that they may even be in our DNA, the ones that prevent youfrom making bad investments have to be learned, and are sometimesfairly counterintuitive.A few days ago I realized something surprising: the situation withtime is much the same as with money.  The most dangerous way tolose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fakework.  When you spend time having fun, you know you\\'re beingself-indulgent.  Alarms start to go off fairly quickly.  If I wokeup one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I\\'dfeel like something was terribly wrong.  Just thinking about itmakes me wince.  I\\'d start to feel uncomfortable after sitting ona sofa watching TV for 2 hours, let alone a whole day.And yet I\\'ve definitely had days when I might as well have sat infront of a TV all day — days at the end of which, if I asked myselfwhat I got done that day, the answer would have been: basically,nothing.  I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as badas I\\'d feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa watching TV.  IfI spent a whole day watching TV I\\'d feel like I was descending intoperdition.  But the same alarms don\\'t go off on the days when I getnothing done, because I\\'m doing stuff that seems, superficially,like real work.  Dealing with email, for example.  You do it sittingat a desk.  It\\'s not fun.  So it must be work.With time, as with money, avoiding pleasure is no longer enough toprotect you.  It probably was enough to protect hunter-gatherers,and perhaps all pre-industrial societies.  So nature and nurturecombine to make us avoid self-indulgence. But the world has gottenmore complicated: the most dangerous traps now are new behaviorsthat bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by mimicking morevirtuous types.  And the worst thing is, they\\'re not even fun.'},\n",

       "  'date': 'May 2003',\n",
       "  'essay_text': '(This essay is derived from a guest lecture at Harvard, which incorporatedan earlier talk at Northeastern.)When I finished grad school in computer science I wentto art school to study painting.  A lot of people seemed surprisedthat someone interested in computers would also be interested in painting.They seemed to think thathacking and painting were very different kinds of work-- thathacking was cold, precise, and methodical, and thatpainting was the frenzied expression of some primal urge.Both of these images are wrong.  Hacking and painting have alot in common.  In fact, of all the different types of people I\\'veknown, hackers and painters are among the most alike.What hackers and painters have in common is that they\\'reboth makers.  Along with composers, architects, and writers,what hackers and painters are trying to do is make good things.They\\'re not doing research per se, though if in the course oftrying to make good things they discover some new technique,so much the better.I\\'ve never liked the term \"computer science.\"  The mainreason I don\\'t like it is that there\\'s no such thing.Computer science is agrab bag of tenuously related areas thrown togetherby an accident of history, like Yugoslavia.At one end you have people who are really mathematicians,but call what they\\'re doing computer science so they can get DARPA grants.In the middle you have people working onsomething like the natural history of computers-- studying thebehavior of algorithms for routing data throughnetworks, for example.  And then at the other extreme youhave the hackers, who are trying towrite interesting software, and for whom computers are just amedium of expression, as concrete is for architects orpaint for painters.  It\\'s as ifmathematicians, physicists, and architects all had to be inthe same department.Sometimes what the hackers do is called \"software engineering,\"but this term is just as misleading.Good software designers are no more engineers than architects are.The border between architecture and engineering is not sharplydefined, but it\\'s there.It falls between what and how: architects decide what to do,and engineers figure out how to do it.What and how should not be kept too separate.  You\\'reasking for trouble if you try to decide what to do withoutunderstanding how to do it.But hacking can certainly be more than just deciding how toimplement some spec.  At its best, it\\'s creating the spec-- thoughit turns out the best way to do that is to implement it.Perhaps one day\"computer science\" will, like Yugoslavia, get broken up into itscomponent parts.  That might be a good thing.  Especially if itmeant independence for my native land, hacking.Bundling all these different types of work together in onedepartment may be convenient administratively, but it\\'s confusingintellectually. That\\'s the other reason I don\\'t like the name\"computer science.\"  Arguably the people in the middle are doingsomething like an experimental science.  But the people at eitherend, the hackers and the mathematicians, are not actually doing science.The mathematicians don\\'t seem bothered by this.  They happilyset to work proving theorems like the other mathematiciansover in the math department, and probably soon stop noticingthat the building they work in says ``computer science\\'\\' on theoutside.  But for the hackers this label is a problem.If what they\\'re doing is called science, it makes them feel theyought to be acting scientific.So instead of doing what they really want to do, which is   to design beautiful software, hackers in universities andresearch labs feel they ought to be writing research papers.In the best case, the papers are just a formality.  Hackers writecool software, and then write a paper about it, and the paperbecomes a proxy for the achievement represented by the software.But often this mismatch causes problems.  It\\'s easy todrift away from building beautiful things toward building uglythings that make more suitable subjects for research papers.Unfortunately, beautiful things don\\'t always make thebest subjects for papers.Number one, research must be original-- andas anyone who has written a PhD dissertation knows, the way tobe sure that you\\'re exploring virgin territory is to to stakeout a piece of ground that no one wants.  Number two, research must besubstantial-- and awkward systems yield meatier papers,because you can write about the obstacles you have to overcomein order to get things done.  Nothing yields meaty problems likestarting with the wrong assumptions.  Most of AI is an exampleof this rule; if you assume that knowledge can be representedas a list of predicate logic expressions whose arguments representabstract concepts, you\\'ll have a lot ofpapers to write about how to make this work.  As Ricky Ricardoused to say, \"Lucy, you got a lot of explaining to do.\"The way to create something beautiful is often to make subtletweaks to something that already exists, or to combine existingideas in a slightly new way.  This kind of work is hard toconvey in a research paper.So why do universities and research labs continue to judgehackers by publications?For the same reason that \"scholastic aptitude\"gets measured by simple-minded standardized tests, orthe productivity of programmers gets measured in lines of code.These testsare easy to apply, and there is nothing so tempting as an easy testthat kind of works.Measuring what hackers are actually trying to do, designingbeautiful software, would be much more difficult.  You needa goodsense of designto judge good design.  Andthere is no correlation, except possiblyanegativeone, between people\\'s ability to recognize gooddesign and their confidence that they can.The only external test is time.  Over time, beautifulthings tend to thrive, and uglythings tend to get discarded.  Unfortunately, the amounts of timeinvolved can be longer than human lifetimes.  Samuel Johnsonsaid it took a hundred years for a writer\\'s reputation toconverge.  You have to wait for the writer\\'sinfluential friends to die, and then for all their followersto die.I think hackers just have to resign themselves to having a large randomcomponent in their reputations.  In this they are no differentfrom other makers.  In fact, they\\'re lucky by comparison.   The influence of fashion is not nearly so great in hacking as itis in painting.There are worse things than having people misunderstand yourwork.  A worse danger is that youwill yourself misunderstand your work.  Related fields arewhere you go looking for ideas.  If you find yourself in the computer sciencedepartment, there is a natural temptation to believe, for example,that hacking is the applied version of what theoretical computerscience is the theory of.   Allthe time I was in graduate school I had an uncomfortable feelingin the back of my mind that I ought to know more theory,and that it was very remiss of me to have forgotten all thatstuff within three weeks of the final exam.Now I realize I wasmistaken.  Hackers need to understand the theory of computationabout as much as painters need to understand paint chemistry.You need to know how to calculate time andspace complexity and aboutTuring completeness.  You might also want to remember atleast the concept of a state machine, in case you have to writea parser or a regular expression library.  Painters in fact   have to remember a good deal more about paint chemistry than that.I\\'ve found that the best sources of ideasare not the other fields that have the word \"computer\" intheir names, but the other fields inhabited by makers.Painting has been a much richer source of ideas than thetheory of computation.For example, I was taught in collegethat one ought to figure out a programcompletely on paperbefore even going near a computer.  I found that I did notprogram this way.  I found that I liked to programsitting in front of a computer, not a piece of paper.  Worsestill, instead of patiently writing out a complete programand assuring myself it was correct, I tended to just spewout code that was hopelessly broken, and gradually beat it intoshape.  Debugging, I was taught, was a kind of final pass whereyou caught typos and oversights.  The way I worked, itseemed like programming consisted of debugging.For a long time I felt bad about this, just as I oncefelt bad that I didn\\'t hold my pencil the way they taught meto in elementary school.If I had only looked over atthe other makers, the painters or the architects, I wouldhave realized that there was a name for what I was doing:sketching.  As far as I can tell, theway they taught me to program in college was all wrong.You should figure out programs as you\\'re writing them,just as writers and painters and architects do.Realizing this has real implications for software design.It means that a programming language should, above all, bemalleable.  A programming language is forthinkingofprograms, not for expressing programs you\\'ve already thoughtof.  It should be a pencil, not a pen.  Static typing wouldbe a fine idea if people actually did write programs the waythey taught me to in college.  But that\\'s not how any of the  hackers I know write programs.  We need a language that lets usscribble and smudge and smear, not a language where you haveto sit with a teacup of types balanced on your knee and makepolite conversation with a strict old aunt of a compiler.While we\\'re on the subject of static typing, identifying withthe makers will save us from another problem that afflictsthe sciences: math envy.  Everyone in the sciencessecretly believes that mathematicians are smarter than they are.  I think mathematicians also believe this.  At any rate,the result is that scientists tend to make theirwork look as mathematical as possible.  In a field likephysics this probably doesn\\'t do much harm, but the further youget from the natural sciences, the more of a problem itbecomes.A page of formulas just looks so impressive.(Tip: for extra impressiveness, use Greek variables.)  Andso there is a great temptation to work on problems youcan treat formally, rather than problems that are, say,important.If hackers identified with other makers, like writers andpainters, they wouldn\\'t feel tempted to do      this.  Writers and painters don\\'t suffer from math envy.They feel as if they\\'re doing something completely unrelated.So are hackers, I think.If universities and research labs keep hackers from doingthe kind of work they want to do,perhaps the place for them is in companies.Unfortunately, most companies won\\'t let hackers do what theywant either.  Universities and research labs force hackersto be scientists, and companies force them to be engineers.I only discovered this myself quite recently.  When Yahoo boughtViaweb, they asked me what I wanted to do.  I had neverliked the business side very much, and said that I just wanted tohack.  When I got to Yahoo, I found that what hacking meantto them was implementing software, not designing it.  Programmerswere seen as technicians who translated the visions (ifthat is the word) of product managers into code.This seems to be thedefault plan in big companies.  They do it becauseit decreases the standard deviation of the outcome.Only a small percentage of hackers can actually design software,and it\\'s hard for thepeople running a company to pick these out.  So instead ofentrusting the future of the software toone brilliant hacker, most companies set things up so that it isdesigned by committee, and the hackers merelyimplement the design.If you want to make money at some point, remember this,because this is one of the reasons startups win.  Big companies wantto decrease the standard deviation of design outcomes because theywant to avoid disasters.  But when you damp oscillations, youlose the high points as well as the low.  This is not a problem forbig companies, because they don\\'t win by making greatproducts.  Big companies win by sucking less than other big companies.So if you can figure out a way to get in adesign war with a company big enough that its software is   designed by product managers, they\\'ll never be able to keep upwith you.  These opportunities are not easy to find, though.It\\'s hard to engage a big company in a design war,just as it\\'s hard to engage an opponent inside a castle in handto hand combat.  It would be pretty easy to write a betterword processor than Microsoft Word, for example, but Microsoft,within the castle of their operating system monopoly,probably wouldn\\'t even notice if you did.The place to fight design wars is in new markets, where no onehas yet managed to establish any fortifications.  That\\'s whereyou can win big by taking the bold approach to design, andhaving the same people both design and implement the product.  Microsoft themselves did this at the start.  So did Apple.And Hewlett-Packard.  I suspect almost every successful startuphas.So one way to build great software is to start your ownstartup.  There are two problems with this, though.  One isthat in a startup you have to do so much besides write software.At Viaweb I considered myself lucky if Igot to hack a quarter of the time.  And the things I had to   do the other three quarters of the time ranged from tediousto terrifying.  I have a benchmark for this, because Ionce had to leave a board meeting to havesome cavities filled.  I remember sitting back in thedentist\\'s chair, waiting for the drill, and feeling likeI was on vacation.The other problem with startups is that there is not muchoverlap between the kind of software that makes money and thekind that\\'s interesting to write.  Programming languagesare interesting to write, and Microsoft\\'s first product wasone, in fact, but no one will pay for programming languagesnow.  If you want to make money, you tend to be forced to workon problems that are too nasty for anyone to solve for free.All makers face this problem.  Prices aredetermined by supply and demand, and there is just not as muchdemand for things that are fun to work on as there is forthings that solve the mundane problems of individual customers.Acting in off-Broadway plays just doesn\\'t pay as well aswearing a gorilla suit in someone\\'s booth at atrade show.  Writing novels doesn\\'t pay as well as writingad copy for garbage disposals.And hacking programming languages doesn\\'t pay as wellas figuring out how to connect some company\\'slegacy database to their Web server.I think the answer to this problem, in the case of software,is a concept known to nearly all makers: the day job.This phrase began with musicians, whoperform at night.  More generally, it means that you have onekind of work you do for money, and another for love.Nearly all makers have day jobs early in their careers.Painters and writers notoriously do.  If you\\'re luckyyou can get a day job that\\'s closelyrelated to your real work.  Musicians oftenseem to work in record stores.  A hacker working on someprogramming language or operating system might likewise be able toget a day job using it.  [1]When I say that the answer is for hackers to have day jobs, and work on beautiful software on the side, I\\'m not proposingthis as a new idea.  This is what open-source hacking is all   about.  What I\\'m saying is that open-source is probably the rightmodel, because it has been independently confirmed by all the  other makers.It seems surprising to me that any employer would be reluctantto let hackers work on open-source projects.At Viaweb, we would have been reluctant to hire anyonewho didn\\'t.  When we interviewedprogrammers, the mainthing we cared about was what kind of software theywrote in their spare time.You can\\'t do anything really well unlessyou love it, and if you love to hack you\\'ll inevitablybe working on projects of your own. [2]Because hackers are makers rather than scientists,the right place to look for metaphors is not in thesciences, but among other kinds of makers.  What else can paintingteach us about hacking?One thing we can learn, or at least confirm, from theexample of painting is how to learn to hack.  You learn topaint mostly by doing it.Ditto for hacking.  Most hackers don\\'t learn to hack bytaking college courses in programming.  They learn to hackby writing programs of their own at age thirteen.  Even in   college classes, you learn to hack mostly by hacking. [3]Because painters leave a trail of work behind them, youcan watch them learn by doing.  If you look at the workof a painter in chronological order, you\\'ll find that each  painting builds on things that have been learned in previousones.  When there\\'s something ina painting that works very well, you can usually find version 1 of it in a smaller form in some earlier painting.I think most makers work this way.  Writers and architects seemto as well.  Maybe it would be good for hackersto act more like painters, and regularly start over from scratch,instead of continuing to work for years on one project, andtrying to incorporate all their later ideas as revisions.The fact that hackers learn to hack by doing it is anothersign of how different hacking is from the sciences.  Scientistsdon\\'t learn science by doing it, but by doing labs and problem sets.Scientists start out doing work that\\'s perfect, in the sensethat they\\'re just trying to reproduce work someone else has already done for them.Eventually, they getto the point where they can do original work.Whereas hackers, from the start, are doing original work; it\\'sjust very bad.  So hackers start original, and get good, andscientists start good, and get original.The other way makers learn is from examples.For a painter, a museum is a reference library of techniques.For hundreds of years it has been part of the traditionaleducation of painters to copy the works of the great masters,because copying forces you to look closelyat the way a painting is made.Writers do this too.Benjamin Franklin learned to write by summarizing the points   in the essays of Addison and Steele and then trying toreproduce them.  Raymond Chandler did the same thingwith detective stories.Hackers, likewise, can learn to program by looking at good programs-- not just at what they do, but the sourcecode too.  One of the less publicized benefitsof the open-source movement is that it has made it easierto learn to program.  When I learned to program, we had to relymostly on examples in books.  The one big chunk ofcode available then was Unix, but even this was not   open source.  Most of the people who read the sourceread it in illicit photocopies of John Lions\\' book, whichthough written in 1977 was not allowed to be publisheduntil 1996.Another example we can take from painting is the way thatpaintings are created by gradual refinement.  Paintings usuallybegin with a sketch.Gradually the details get filled in.But it is not merely a process of filling in. Sometimes   the original plans turn out to be mistaken.Countless paintings,when you look at them in xrays, turn out to have limbs thathave been moved or facial features that have been readjusted.Here\\'s a case where we can learn from painting.  I think hackingshould work this way too.  It\\'s unrealisticto expect that the specifications for a program will beperfect. You\\'rebetter off if you admit this up front, and write programs ina way that allows specifications to change on the fly.(The structure of large companies makes this hard for themto do, so here is another place where startups have an advantage.)Everyone by now presumably knows about the danger of prematureoptimization.  I think we should be just as worried aboutpremature design-- deciding too early whata program should do.The right tools can help us avoidthis danger.A good programming language should, like oil paint, make iteasy to change your mind.  Dynamic typing is a win here becauseyou don\\'t have tocommit to specific data representations up front.But the key to flexibility, I think, is to make the languageveryabstract.The easiest program to change is one that\\'s very short.This sounds like a paradox, but a great paintinghas to be better than it has to be.For example, when Leonardopainted the portrait ofGinevra de Benciin the National Gallery, he put a juniper bush behind her head.In it he carefullypainted each individual leaf.  Many painters might have thought,this is just something to put in the background to frameher head.  No one will look that closely at it.Not Leonardo.  How hard he worked on part of a painting didn\\'tdepend at all on how closely he expected anyone to look at it.He was like Michael Jordan.  Relentless.Relentlessness wins because, in the aggregate, unseen detailsbecome visible.When people walk by the portrait of Ginevra de Benci,their attention is often immediately arrested by it,even before they look at the label and notice that it saysLeonardo da Vinci.  All those unseen details combine to producesomething that\\'s just stunning, like a thousand barely audiblevoices all singing in tune.Great software, likewise, requires a fanatical devotion tobeauty.  If you look inside good software, you find thatparts no one is ever supposed to see are beautiful too.I\\'m not claiming I write great software, but Iknow that when it comes to code I behave in a way that wouldmake me eligible for prescription drugs if I approached everydaylife the same way.It drives me crazy to see code that\\'s badly indented,or that uses ugly variable names.If a hacker were a mere implementor, turning a spec into code, thenhe could just work his way through it from one end to the other likesomeone digging a ditch.  But if the hacker is a creator, we haveto take inspiration into account.In hacking, like painting,work comes in cycles.  Sometimes you get excited about somenew project and you want to work sixteen hours a day on it. Other times nothing seems interesting.To do good work you have to take these cycles intoaccount, because they\\'re affected by how you react to them.When you\\'re driving acar with a manual transmission on a hill, you have to back offthe clutch sometimes to avoid stalling.  Backingoff can likewise prevent ambition from stalling.In both painting and hacking there are sometasks that are terrifyingly ambitious, and others that arecomfortingly routine.  It\\'s a good idea to save some easytasks for moments when you would otherwise stall.In hacking, this can literally mean saving up bugs.I like debugging: it\\'s theone time that hacking is as straightforward as   people think it is.  You have atotally constrained problem, and all you have to do is solveit.  Your program is supposed to do x.  Instead it does y.Where does it go wrong? You know you\\'re going to winin the end.  It\\'s as relaxing as painting a wall.The example of painting can teach us not only how to manage ourown work, but how to work together.  A lot of thegreat art of the past is the work of multiple hands, thoughthere may only be one name on the wall next to it in themuseum.  Leonardo was an apprentice in the workshop ofVerrocchio and painted one of the angels in hisBaptism ofChrist.  This sort of thing was the rule, not the exception.Michelangelo was considered especially dedicated for insistingon painting all the figures on the ceiling of the SistineChapel himself.As far as I know, when painters worked together on a painting,they never worked on the same parts.  It was commonfor the master to paint the principal figures and for assistantsto paint the others and the background.  But you never hadone guy painting over the work of another.I think this is the right model for collaboration in softwaretoo.  Don\\'t push it too far.  When a piece of code isbeing hacked by three or four different people, no one of whomreally owns it, it will end up being like a common-room.  It willtend to feel bleak and abandoned, and accumulate cruft.The rightway to collaborate, I think, is to divide projects into sharplydefined modules, each with a definite owner, and with interfacesbetween them that are as carefully designed and, if possible,as articulated as programming languages.Like painting, most software is intended fora human audience.  And so hackers, like painters, must haveempathy to do really great work.  You have to be able to seethings from the user\\'s point of view.When I was a kid I was always being told to look at things fromsomeone else\\'s point of view.  What this always meant inpractice was to do what someone else wanted, instead of whatI wanted.  This of course gave empathy a bad name, and I made apoint of not cultivating it.Boy, was I wrong.  It turns out that looking at things from other people\\'s point of view is practically the secret ofsuccess.  It doesn\\'t necessarily mean being self-sacrificing.Far from it.  Understanding how someone else sees thingsdoesn\\'t imply that you\\'ll act in his interest; in somesituations-- in war, for example-- you want to do exactlythe opposite. [4]Most makers make things for a human audience.And to engage an audience you have to understand what they need.Nearly all the greatest paintings are paintings of people,for example, because people are what people are interested in.Empathy is probably the single most important differencebetween a good hacker and a great one.  Some hackersare quite smart, but when it comes to empathy arepractically solipsists.  It\\'s hard for such      people to design great software [5], because they can\\'tsee things from the user\\'s point of view.One way to tell how good people are at empathy is to watchthem explain a technical question to someone without a technicalbackground.  We probably all know people who, though otherwise smart,are just comically bad at this.  If someone asks them ata dinner party what a programming language is, they\\'llsay something like ``Oh, a high-level language is whatthe compiler uses as input to generate object code.\\'\\'High-level language?  Compiler?  Object code?  Someone who doesn\\'t know what a programming language is obviously doesn\\'tknow what these things are, either.Part of what software has to do is explain itself.  So to   write good software you have to understand how little users   understand.They\\'re going to walk up to the software with no preparation, andit had better do what they guess it will, because they\\'renot going to read the manual.  The best system I\\'ve ever seen in this respect was the original Macintosh, in 1985.It did what software almost never does: it just worked. [6]Source code, too, should explain itself.  If I could get people toremember just one quote about programming, it would be theone at the beginning ofStructure and Interpretation of ComputerPrograms.Programs should be written for people to read, andonly incidentally for machines to execute.You need to have empathy not just for your users, but for your readers.  It\\'s in  your interest, because you\\'ll be one of them.Many a hacker has written a program only tofind on returning to it six months later that he has no idea   how it works.  I know several people who\\'ve sworn off Perl aftersuch experiences. [7]Lack of empathy is associated with intelligence, to the pointthat there is even something of a fashion for it in some places.But I don\\'t think there\\'s any correlation.You can do well in math andthe natural sciences without having to learn empathy, and people in thesefields tend to be smart, so the two qualities have come to beassociated.  But there are plenty of dumb people who are bad atempathy too.  Just listen to the people who call in with questions ontalk shows.  They ask whatever it is they\\'re asking insuch a roundabout waythat the hosts often have to rephrase the question for them.So, if hacking works like painting and writing, is it as cool?After all, you only get one life.You might as well spend it working on something great.Unfortunately, the question is hard to answer.  There is alwaysa big time lag in prestige.  It\\'s like light from a distant star.Painting has prestige now because of great work people did five hundredyears ago.  At the time, no one thoughtthese paintings were as important as we do today.  It would haveseemed very odd to people at the time that Federico da Montefeltro,the Duke of Urbino, would one day be known mostly as the guywith the strange nose in apaintingby Piero della Francesca.So while I admit that hacking doesn\\'t seem as cool as painting now,we should remember that painting itself didn\\'t seem as cool inits glory days as it does now.What we can say with some confidence is that these are the glorydays of hacking.  In most fields the great work is done early on.The paintings made between 1430 and 1500 are still unsurpassed.Shakespeare appeared just as professional theater was being born,and pushed the mediumso far that every playwright since has had to live in his shadow.Albrecht Durer did the same thing with engraving, and Jane Austenwith the novel.Over and over we see the same pattern.  A new medium appears, andpeople are so excited about it that they explore most of itspossibilities in the first couple generations.   Hacking seemsto be in this phase now.Painting was not, in Leonardo\\'s time, as cool as his workhelped make it.How cool hacking turns out to be will depend on what we cando with this new medium.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Writing about something, even something you know well, usually showsyou that you didn\\'t know it as well as you thought. Putting ideasinto words is a severe test. The first words you choose are usuallywrong; you have to rewrite sentences over and overtoget them exactly right. And your ideas won\\'t just be imprecise, butincomplete too. Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be onesyou thought of while you were writing it. Indeed, that\\'s why I writethem.Once you publish something, the convention is that whatever youwrote was what you thought before you wrote it. These were yourideas, and now you\\'ve expressed them. But you know this isn\\'t true.You know that putting your ideas into words changed them. And notjust the ideas you published. Presumably there were others thatturned out to be too broken to fix, and those you discarded instead.It\\'s not just having to commit your ideas to specific words thatmakes writing so exacting. The real test is reading what you\\'vewritten. You have to pretend to be a neutral reader who knows nothingof what\\'s in your head, only what you wrote. When he reads what youwrote, does it seem correct? Does it seem complete? If you make aneffort, you can read your writing as if you were a complete stranger,and when you do the news is usually bad. It takes me many cyclesbefore I can get an essay past the stranger. But the stranger isrational, so you always can, if you ask him what he needs. If he\\'snot satisfied because you failed to mention x or didn\\'t qualifysome sentence sufficiently, then you mention x or add morequalifications. Happy now? It may cost you some nice sentences, butyou have to resign yourself to that. You just have to make them asgood as you can and still satisfy the stranger.This much, I assume, won\\'t be that controversial. I think it willaccord with the experience of anyone who has tried to write aboutanything nontrivial. There may exist people whose thoughts are soperfectly formed that they just flow straight into words. But I\\'venever known anyone who could do this, and if I met someone who saidthey could, it would seem evidence of their limitations rather thantheir ability. Indeed, this is a trope in movies: the guy who claimsto have a plan for doing some difficult thing, and who when questionedfurther, taps his head and says \"It\\'s all up here.\" Everyone watchingthe movie knows what that means. At best the plan is vague andincomplete. Very likely there\\'s some undiscovered flaw that invalidatesit completely. At best it\\'s a plan for a plan.In precisely defined domains it\\'s possible to form complete ideasin your head. People can play chess in their heads, for example.And mathematicians can do some amount of math in their heads, thoughthey don\\'t seem to feel sure of a proof over a certain length tillthey write it down. But this only seems possible with ideas you canexpress in a formal language.Arguably what such people aredoing is putting ideas into words in their heads. I can to someextent write essays in my head. I\\'ll sometimes think of a paragraphwhile walking or lying in bed that survives nearly unchanged in thefinal version. But really I\\'m writing when I do this. I\\'m doing themental part of writing; my fingers just aren\\'t moving as I do it.You can know a great deal about something without writing about it.Can you ever know so much that you wouldn\\'t learn more from tryingto explain what you know? I don\\'t think so. I\\'ve written about atleast two subjects I know well — Lisp hacking and startups— and in both cases I learned a lot from writing about them.In both cases there were things I didn\\'t consciously realize tillI had to explain them. And I don\\'t think my experience was anomalous.A great deal of knowledge is unconscious, and experts have ifanything a higher proportion of unconscious knowledge than beginners.I\\'m not saying that writing is the best way to explore all ideas.If you have ideas about architecture, presumably the best way toexplore them is to build actual buildings. What I\\'m saying is thathowever much you learn from exploring ideas in other ways, you\\'llstill learn new things from writing about them.Putting ideas into words doesn\\'t have to mean writing, of course.You can also do it the old way, by talking. But in my experience,writing is the stricter test. You have to commit to a single, optimalsequence of words. Less can go unsaid when you don\\'t have tone ofvoice to carry meaning. And you can focus in a way that would seemexcessive in conversation. I\\'ll often spend 2 weeks on an essay andreread drafts 50 times. If you did that in conversationit would seem evidence of some kind ofmental disorder. If you\\'re lazy,of course, writing and talking are equally useless. But if you wantto push yourself to get things right, writing is the steeper hill.The reason I\\'ve spent so long establishing this rather obvious pointis that it leads to another that many people will find shocking.If writing down your ideas always makes them more precise and morecomplete, then no one who hasn\\'t written about a topic has fullyformed ideas about it. And someone who never writes has no fullyformed ideas about anything nontrivial.It feels to them as if they do, especially if they\\'re not in thehabit of critically examining their own thinking. Ideas can feelcomplete. It\\'s only when you try to put them into words that youdiscover they\\'re not. So if you never subject your ideas to thattest, you\\'ll not only never have fully formed ideas, but also neverrealize it.Putting ideas into words is certainly no guarantee that they\\'ll beright. Far from it. But though it\\'s not a sufficient condition, itis a necessary one.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.August 2013The biggest component in most investors\\' opinion of you is theopinion of other investors.  Which is of course a recipe forexponential growth.  When one investor wants to invest in you, thatmakes other investors want to, which makes others want to, and soon.Sometimes inexperienced founders mistakenly conclude that manipulatingthese forces is the essence of fundraising.  They hear stories aboutstampedes to invest in successful startups, and think it\\'s thereforethe mark of a successful startup to have this happen.  But actuallythe two are not that highly correlated.  Lots of startups that causestampedes end up flaming out (in extreme cases, partly as a resultof the stampede), and lots of very successful startups were onlymoderately popular with investors the first time they raised money.So the point of this essay is not to explain how to create a stampede,but merely to explain the forces that generate them.  These forcesare always at work to some degree in fundraising, and they can causesurprising situations.  If you understand them, you can at leastavoid being surprised.One reason investors like you more when other investors like youis that you actually become a better investment.  Raising moneydecreases the risk of failure.  Indeed, although investors hate it,you are for this reason justified in raising your valuation forlater investors.  The investors who invested when you had no moneywere taking more risk, and are entitled to higher returns.  Plus acompany that has raised money is literally more valuable.  Afteryou raise the first million dollars, the company is at least amillion dollars more valuable, because it\\'s the same company asbefore, plus it has a million dollars in the bank.Beware, though, because later investors so hate to have the priceraised on them that they resist even this self-evident reasoning.Only raise the price on an investor you\\'re comfortable with losing,because some will angrily refuse.The second reason investors like you more when you\\'ve had somesuccess at fundraising is that it makes you more confident, and aninvestors\\' opinion ofyouis the foundationof their opinion of your company.  Founders are often surprised howquickly investors seem to know when they start to succeed at raisingmoney.  And while there are in fact lots of ways for such informationto spread among investors, the main vector is probably the foundersthemselves.  Though they\\'re often clueless about technology, mostinvestors are pretty good at reading people.  When fundraising isgoing well, investors are quick to sense it in your increasedconfidence.  (This is one case where the average founder\\'s inabilityto remain poker-faced works to your advantage.)But frankly the most important reason investors like you more whenyou\\'ve started to raise money is that they\\'re bad at judging startups.Judging startups is hard even for the best investors.  The mediocreones might as well be flipping coins.  So when mediocre investorssee that lots of other people want to invest in you, they assumethere must be a reason.  This leads to the phenomenon known in theValley as the \"hot deal,\" where you have more interest from investorsthan you can handle.The best investors aren\\'t influenced much by the opinion of otherinvestors.  It would only dilute their own judgment to average ittogether with other people\\'s.  But they are indirectly influencedin the practical sense that interest from other investors imposesa deadline.  This is the fourth way in which offers beget offers.If you start to get far along the track toward an offer with onefirm, it will sometimes provoke other firms, even good ones, tomake up their minds, lest they lose the deal.Unless you\\'re a wizard at negotiation (and if you\\'re not sure,you\\'re not) be very careful about exaggerating this to push a goodinvestor to decide.  Founders try this sort of thing all the time,and investors are very sensitive to it.  If anything oversensitive.But you\\'re safe so long as you\\'re telling the truth.  If you\\'regetting far along with investor B, but you\\'d rather raise moneyfrom investor A, you can tell investor A that this is happening.There\\'s no manipulation in that.  You\\'re genuinely in a bind, becauseyou really would rather raise money from A, but you can\\'t safelyreject an offer from B when it\\'s still uncertain what A will decide.Do not, however, tell A who B is.  VCs will sometimes ask whichother VCs you\\'re talking to, but you should never tell them.  Angelsyou can sometimes tell about other angels, because angels cooperatemore with one another. But if VCs ask, just point out that theywouldn\\'t want you telling other firms about your conversations, andyou feel obliged to do the same for any firm you talk to.  If theypush you, point out that you\\'re inexperienced at fundraising — whichis always a safe card to play — and you feel you have to beextra cautious.While few startups will experience a stampede of interest, almostall will at least initially experience the other side of thisphenomenon, where the herd remains clumped together at a distance.The fact that investors are so much influenced by other investors\\'opinions means you always start out in something of a hole.  Sodon\\'t be demoralized by how hard it is to get the first commitment,because much of the difficulty comes from this external force.  Thesecond will be easier.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'I\\'m not a very good speaker.  I say \"um\" a lot. Sometimes I haveto pause when I lose my train of thought.  I wish I were a betterspeaker.  But I don\\'t wish I were a better speaker like I wish Iwere a better writer.  What I really want is to have good ideas,and that\\'s a much bigger part of being a good writer than being agood speaker.Having good ideas is most of writing well.  If you know what you\\'retalking about, you can say it in the plainest words and you\\'ll beperceived as having a good style.  With speaking it\\'s the opposite:having good ideas is an alarmingly small component of being a goodspeaker.I first noticed this at a conference several years ago.There was another speaker who was much better than me.He had all of us roaring with laughter.  I seemed awkward andhalting by comparison.  Afterward I put my talk online like I usuallydo.  As I was doing it I tried to imagine what a transcript of theother guy\\'s talk would be like, and it was only then I realized hehadn\\'t said very much.Maybe this would have been obvious to someone who knew more aboutspeaking, but it was a revelation to me how much less ideas matteredin speaking than writing.A few years later I heard a talk by someone who was not merely abetter speaker than me, but a famous speaker.  Boy was he good.  SoI decided I\\'d pay close attention to what he said, to learn how hedid it.  After about ten sentences I found myself thinking \"I don\\'twant to be a good speaker.\"Being a really good speaker is not merely orthogonal to having good ideas,but in many ways pushes you in the opposite direction.  For example,when I give a talk, I usually write it out beforehand.  I know that\\'sa mistake; I know delivering aprewrittentalk makes it harder toengage with an audience.  The way to get the attention of an audienceis to give themyourfull attention, and when you\\'re deliveringa prewritten talk, your attention is always divided between theaudience and the talk — even if you\\'ve memorized it.  If you wantto engage an audience, it\\'s better to start with no more than an outlineof what you want to say andad libthe individual sentences.  Butif you do that, you might spend no more time thinking about eachsentence than it takes to say it.Occasionally the stimulationof talking to a live audience makes you think of new things, butin general this is not going to generate ideas as well as writingdoes, where you can spend as long on each sentence as you want.If you rehearse a prewritten speech enough, you can getasymptotically close to the sort of engagement you get when speakingad lib.  Actors do.  But here again there\\'s a tradeoff betweensmoothness and ideas.  All the time you spend practicing a talk,you could instead spend making it better.  Actors don\\'t facethat temptation, except in the rare cases where they\\'ve written thescript, but any speaker does.  Before I give a talk I can usuallybe found sitting in a corner somewhere with a copy printed out onpaper, trying to rehearse it in my head.  But I always end upspending most of the time rewriting it instead.  Every talk I giveends up being given from a manuscript full of things crossed outand rewritten.  Which of course makes me um even more, because Ihaven\\'t had any time to practice the new bits.Depending on your audience, there are even worse tradeoffs thanthese.  Audiences like to be flattered; they like jokes; they liketo be swept off their feet by a vigorous stream of words.  As youdecrease the intelligence of the audience, being a good speaker isincreasingly a matter of being a good bullshitter.  That\\'s true inwriting too of course, but the descent is steeper with talks.  Anygiven person is dumber as a member of an audience than as a reader.Just as a speaker ad libbing can only spend as long thinking abouteach sentence as it takes to say it, a person hearing a talk canonly spend as long thinking about each sentence as it takes to hearit.  Plus people in an audience are always affected by the reactionsof those around them, and the reactions that spread from person toperson in an audience are disproportionately the more brutish sort,just as low notes travel through walls better than high ones.  Everyaudience is an incipient mob, and a good speaker uses that.  Partof the reason I laughed so much at the talk by the good speaker atthat conference was that everyone else did.So are talks useless?  They\\'re certainly inferior to the writtenword as a source of ideas.  But that\\'s not all talks are good for.When I go to a talk, it\\'s usually because I\\'m interested in thespeaker.  Listening to a talk is the closest most of us can get tohaving a conversation with someone like the president, who doesn\\'thave time to meet individually with all the people who want to meethim.Talks are also good at motivating me to do things.  It\\'s probablyno coincidence that so many famous speakers are described asmotivational speakers.  That may be what public speaking is reallyfor.  It\\'s probably what it was originally for.  The emotionalreactions you can elicit with a talk can be a powerful force.I wish I could say that this force was more often used for good thanill, but I\\'m not sure.'},\n",

Lots of schools thinkthey should tell students something about startups. This is what Ithink they should tell them.)Most of you probably think that when you\\'re released into theso-called real world you\\'ll eventually have to get some kind ofjob. That\\'s not true, and today I\\'m going to talk about a trick youcan use to avoid ever having to get a job.The trick is to start your own company. So it\\'s not a trick foravoidingwork, because if you start your own company you\\'llwork harder than you would if you had an ordinary job. But you willavoid many of the annoying things that come with a job, includinga boss telling you what to do.It\\'s more exciting to work on your own project than someone else\\'s.And you can also get a lot richer. In fact, this is the standardway to getreally rich. If you look at the lists of the richestpeople that occasionally get published in the press, nearly all ofthem did it by starting their own companies.Starting your own company can mean anything from starting a barbershop to starting Google. I\\'m here to talk about one extreme end ofthat continuum. I\\'m going to tell you how to start Google.The companies at the Google end of the continuum are called startupswhen they\\'re young. The reason I know about them is that my wifeJessica and I started something called Y Combinator that is basicallya startup factory. Since 2005, Y Combinator has funded over 4000startups. So we know exactly what you need to start a startup,because we\\'ve helped people do it for the last 19 years.You might have thought I was joking when I said I was going to tellyou how to start Google. You might be thinking \"How couldwestart Google?\" But that\\'s effectively what the people who did startGoogle were thinking before they started it. If you\\'d told LarryPage and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google, that the company theywere about to start would one day be worth over a trillion dollars,their heads would have exploded.All you can know when you start working on a startup is that itseems worth pursuing. You can\\'t know whether it will turn intoa company worth billions or one that goes out of business. So when Isay I\\'m going to tell you how to start Google, I mean I\\'m going totell you how to get to the point where you can start a company thathas as much chance of being Google as Google had of being Google.How do you get from where you are now to the point where you canstart a successful startup? You need three things. You need to begood at some kind of technology, you need an idea for what you\\'regoing to build, and you need cofounders to start the company with.How do you get good at technology? And how do you choose whichtechnology to get good at? Both of those questions turn out to havethe same answer: work on your own projects. Don\\'t try to guesswhether gene editing or LLMs or rockets will turn out to be themost valuable technology to know about. No one can predict that.Just work on whatever interests you the most. You\\'ll work muchharder on something you\\'re interested in than something you\\'re doingbecause you think you\\'re supposed to.If you\\'re not sure what technology to get good at, get good atprogramming. That has been the source of the median startup for thelast 30 years, and this is probably not going to change in the next10.Those of you who are taking computer science classes in school mayat this point be thinking, ok, we\\'ve got this sorted. We\\'re alreadybeing taught all about programming. But sorry, this is not enough.You have to be working on your own projects, not just learning stuffin classes. You can do well in computer science classes withoutever really learning to program. In fact you can graduate with adegree in computer science from a top university and still not beany good at programming. That\\'s why tech companies all make youtake a coding test before they\\'ll hire you, regardless of where youwent to university or how well you did there. They know grades andexam results prove nothing.If you really want to learn to program, you have to work on yourown projects. You learn so much faster that way. Imagine you\\'rewriting a game and there\\'s something you want to do in it, and youdon\\'t know how. You\\'re going to figure out how a lot faster thanyou\\'d learn anything in a class.You don\\'t have to learn programming, though. If you\\'re wonderingwhat counts as technology, it includes practically everything youcould describe using the words \"make\" or \"build.\" So welding wouldcount, or making clothes, or making videos. Whatever you\\'re mostinterested in. The critical distinction is whether you\\'re producingor just consuming. Are you writing computer games, or just playingthem? That\\'s the cutoff.Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, spent time when he was a teenagerstudying calligraphy — the sort of beautiful writing thatyou see in medieval manuscripts. No one, including him, thoughtthat this would help him in his career. He was just doing it becausehe was interested in it. But it turned out to help him a lot. Thecomputer that made Apple really big, the Macintosh, came out atjust the moment when computers got powerful enough to make letterslike the ones in printed books instead of the computery-lookingletters you see in 8 bit games. Apple destroyed everyone else atthis, and one reason was that Steve was one of the few people inthe computer business who really got graphic design.Don\\'t feel like your projects have to beserious. They canbe as frivolous as you like, so long as you\\'re building thingsyou\\'re excited about. Probably 90% of programmers start out buildinggames. They and their friends like to play games. So they buildthe kind of things they and their friends want. And that\\'s exactlywhat you should be doing at 15 if you want to start a startup oneday.You don\\'t have to do just one project. In fact it\\'s good to learnabout multiple things. Steve Jobs didn\\'t just learn calligraphy.He also learned about electronics, which was even more valuable.Whatever you\\'re interested in. (Do you notice a theme here?)So that\\'s the first of the three things you need, to get good atsome kind or kinds of technology. You do it the same way you getgood at the violin or football: practice. If you start a startupat 22, and you start writing your own programs now, then by thetime you start the company you\\'ll have spent at least 7 yearspracticing writing code, and you can get pretty good at anythingafter practicing it for 7 years.Let\\'s suppose you\\'re 22 and you\\'ve succeeded: You\\'re now reallygood at some technology. How do you getstartup ideas? It mightseem like that\\'s the hard part. Even if you are a good programmer,how do you get the idea to start Google?Actually it\\'s easy to get startup ideas once you\\'re good at technology.Once you\\'re good at some technology, when you look at the world yousee dotted outlines around the things that are missing. You startto be able to see both the things that are missing from the technologyitself, and all the broken things that could be fixed using it, andeach one of these is a potential startup.In the town near our house there\\'s a shop with a sign warning thatthe door is hard to close. The sign has been there for severalyears. To the people in the shop it must seem like this mysteriousnatural phenomenon that the door sticks, and all they can do is putup a sign warning customers about it. But any carpenter looking atthis situation would think \"why don\\'t you just plane off the partthat sticks?\"Once you\\'re good at programming, all the missing software in theworld starts to become as obvious as a sticking door to a carpenter.I\\'ll give you a real world example. Back in the 20th century,American universities used to publish printed directories with allthe students\\' names and contact info. When I tell you what thesedirectories were called, you\\'ll know which startup I\\'m talkingabout. They were called facebooks, because they usually had a pictureof each student next to their name.So Mark Zuckerberg shows up at Harvard in 2002, and the universitystill hasn\\'t gotten the facebook online. Each individual house hasan online facebook, but there isn\\'t one for the whole university.The university administration has been diligently having meetingsabout this, and will probably have solved the problem in anotherdecade or so. Most of the students don\\'t consciously notice thatanything is wrong. But Mark is a programmer. He looks at thissituation and thinks \"Well, this is stupid. I could write a programto fix this in one night. Just let people upload their own photosand then combine the data into a new site for the whole university.\"So he does. And almost literally overnight he has thousands ofusers.Of course Facebook was not a startup yet. It was just a... project.There\\'s that word again. Projects aren\\'t just the best way to learnabout technology. They\\'re also the best source of startup ideas.Facebook was not unusual in this respect. Apple and Google alsobegan as projects. Apple wasn\\'t meant to be a company. Steve Wozniakjust wanted to build his own computer. It only turned into a companywhen Steve Jobs said \"Hey, I wonder if we could sell plans for thiscomputer to other people.\" That\\'s how Apple started. They weren\\'teven selling computers, just plans for computers. Can you imaginehow lame this company seemed?Ditto for Google. Larry and Sergey weren\\'t trying to start a companyat first. They were just trying to make search better. Before Google,most search engines didn\\'t try to sort the results they gave youin order of importance. If you searched for \"rugby\" they just gaveyou every web page that contained the word \"rugby.\" And the web wasso small in 1997 that this actually worked! Kind of. There mightonly be 20 or 30 pages with the word \"rugby,\" but the web was growingexponentially, which meant this way of doing search was becomingexponentially more broken. Most users just thought, \"Wow, I surehave to look through a lot of search results to find what I want.\"Door sticks. But like Mark, Larry and Sergey were programmers. LikeMark, they looked at this situation and thought \"Well, this isstupid. Some pages about rugby matter more than others. Let\\'s figureout which those are and show them first.\"It\\'s obvious in retrospect that this was a great idea for a startup.It wasn\\'t obvious at the time. It\\'s never obvious. If it was obviouslya good idea to start Apple or Google or Facebook, someone else wouldhave already done it. That\\'s why the best startups grow out ofprojects that aren\\'t meant to be startups. You\\'re not trying tostart a company. You\\'re just following your instincts about what\\'sinteresting. And if you\\'re young and good at technology, then yourunconscious instincts about what\\'s interesting are better than yourconscious ideas about what would be a good company.So it\\'s critical, if you\\'re a young founder, to build things foryourself and your friends to use. The biggest mistake young foundersmake is to build something for some mysterious group of other people.But if you can make something that you and your friends truly wantto use — something your friends aren\\'t just using out ofloyalty to you, but would be really sad to lose if you shut it down— then you almost certainly have the germ of a good startupidea. It may not seem like a startup to you. It may not be obvioushow to make money from it. But trust me, there\\'s a way.What you need in a startup idea, and all you need, is somethingyour friends actually want. And those ideas aren\\'t hard to see onceyou\\'re good at technology. There are sticking doors everywhere.Now for the third and final thing you need: a cofounder, or cofounders.The optimal startup has two or three founders, so you need one ortwo cofounders. How do you find them? Can you predict what I\\'m goingto say next? It\\'s the same thing: projects. You find cofounders byworking on projects with them. What you need in a cofounder issomeone who\\'s good at what they do and that you work well with, andthe only way to judge this is to work with them on things.At this point I\\'m going to tell you something you might not wantto hear. It really matters to do well in your classes, even theones that are just memorization or blathering about literature,because you need to do well in your classes to get into a gooduniversity. And if you want to start a startup you should try toget into the best university you can, because that\\'s where the bestcofounders are. It\\'s also where the best employees are. When Larryand Sergey started Google, they began by just hiring all the smartestpeople they knew out of Stanford, and this was a real advantage forthem.The empirical evidence is clear on this. If you look at where thelargest numbers of successful startups come from, it\\'s pretty muchthe same as the list of the most selective universities.I don\\'t think it\\'s the prestigious names of these universities thatcause more good startups to come out of them. Nor do I think it\\'sbecause the quality of the teaching is better. What\\'s driving thisis simply the difficulty of getting in. You have to be pretty smartand determined to get into MIT or Cambridge, so if you do manageto get in, you\\'ll find the other students include a lot of smartand determined people.You don\\'t have to start a startup with someone you meet at university.The founders of Twitch met when they were seven. The founders ofStripe, Patrick and John Collison, met when John was born. Butuniversities are the main source of cofounders. And because they\\'rewhere the cofounders are, they\\'re also where the ideas are, becausethe best ideas grow out of projects you do with the people whobecome your cofounders.So the list of what you need to do to get from here to starting astartup is quite short. You need to get good at technology, and theway to do that is to work on your own projects. And you need to doas well in school as you can, so you can get into a good university,because that\\'s where the cofounders and the ideas are.That\\'s it, just two things, build stuff and do well in school.'},\n",

The fact that it has such a coreis one of Lisp\\'s distinguishing features, and the reason why,unlike other languages, Lisp has dialects.)In 1960,John McCarthypublished a remarkable paper inwhich he did for programming something like what Euclid did forgeometry. He showed how, given a handful of simpleoperators and a notation for functions, you canbuild a whole programming language.He called this language Lisp, for \"List Processing,\"because one of his key ideas was to use a simpledata structure called alistfor bothcode and data.It\\'s worth understanding what McCarthy discovered, notjust as a landmark in the history of computers, but asa model for what programming is tending to become inour own time.  It seems to me that there have beentwo really clean, consistent models of programming sofar: the C model and the Lisp model.These two seem points of high ground, with swampy lowlandsbetween them.  As computers have grown more powerful,the new languages being developed have beenmovingsteadilytoward the Lisp model.  A popular recipefor new programming languages in the past 20 years has been to take the C model of computing and add toit, piecemeal, parts taken from the Lisp model,like runtime typing and garbage collection.In this article I\\'m going to try to explain in thesimplest possible terms what McCarthy discovered.The point is not just to learn about an interestingtheoretical result someone figured out forty years ago,but to show where languages are heading.The unusual thing about Lisp — in fact, the definingquality of Lisp — is that it can be written initself.

       "  'essay_text': 'Before I had kids, I was afraid of having kids. Up to that point Ifelt about kids the way the young Augustine felt about livingvirtuously. I\\'d have been sad to think I\\'d never have children.But did I want them now? No.If I had kids, I\\'d become a parent, and parents, as I\\'d known sinceI was a kid, were uncool. They were dull and responsible and hadno fun.  And while it\\'s not surprising that kids would believe that,to be honest I hadn\\'t seen much as an adult to change my mind.Whenever I\\'d noticed parents with kids, the kids seemed to beterrors, and the parents pathetic harried creatures, even when theyprevailed.When people had babies, I congratulated them enthusiastically,because that seemed to be what one did. But I didn\\'t feel it atall.  \"Better you than me,\" I was thinking.Now when people have babies I congratulate them enthusiastically andI mean it. Especially the first one. I feel like they just got the best gift in the world.What changed, of course, is that I had kids. Something I dreadedturned out to be wonderful.Partly, and I won\\'t deny it, this is because of serious chemicalchanges that happened almost instantly when our first child wasborn.  It was like someone flipped a switch. I suddenly feltprotective not just toward our child, but toward all children. As I wasdriving my wife and new son home from the hospital, I approached acrosswalk full of pedestrians, and I found myself thinking \"I haveto be really careful of all these people. Every one of them issomeone\\'s child!\"So to some extent you can\\'t trust me when I say having kids isgreat.  To some extent I\\'m like a religious cultist telling youthat you\\'ll be happy if you join the cult too — but only becausejoining the cult will alter your mind in a way that will make youhappy to be a cult member.But not entirely. There were some thingsabout having kids that I clearly got wrong before I had them.For example, there was a huge amount of selection bias in myobservations of parents and children. Some parents may have noticedthat I wrote \"Whenever I\\'d noticed parents with kids.\" Of coursethe times I noticed kids were when things were going wrong. I onlynoticed them when they made noise. And where was I when I noticedthem?  Ordinarily I never went to places with kids, so the onlytimes I encountered them were in shared bottlenecks like airplanes.Which is not exactly a representative sample. Flying with a toddleris something very few parents enjoy.What I didn\\'t notice, because they tend to be much quieter, wereall the great moments parents had with kids. People don\\'t talk aboutthese much — the magic is hard to put into words, and all otherparents know about them anyway — but one of the great things abouthaving kids is that there are so many times when you feel there isnowhere else you\\'d rather be, and nothing else you\\'d rather bedoing.  You don\\'t have to be doing anything special. You could justbe going somewhere together, or putting them to bed, or pushingthem on the swings at the park. But you wouldn\\'t trade these momentsfor anything. One doesn\\'t tend to associate kids with peace, butthat\\'s what you feel.  You don\\'t need to look anyfurther than where you are right now.Before I had kids, I had moments of this kind of peace, but theywere rarer. With kids it can happen several times a day.My other source of data about kids was my own childhood, and thatwas similarly misleading. I was pretty bad, and was always in troublefor something or other. So it seemed to me that parenthood wasessentially law enforcement.  I didn\\'t realize there were good timestoo.I remember my mother telling me once when I was about 30 that she\\'dreally enjoyed having me and my sister. My god, I thought, thiswoman is a saint. She not only endured all the pain we subjectedher to, but actually enjoyed it? Now I realize she was simply tellingthe truth.She said that one reason she liked having us was that we\\'d beeninteresting to talk to. That took me by surprise when I had kids.You don\\'t just love them. They become your friends too. They\\'rereally interesting. And while I admit small children are disastrouslyfond of repetition (anything worth doing once is worth doing fiftytimes) it\\'s often genuinely fun to play with them.  That surprisedme too. Playing with a 2 year old was fun when I was 2 and definitelynot fun when I was 6. Why would it become fun again later? But itdoes.There are of course times that are pure drudgery. Or worse still,terror. Having kids is one of those intense types of experiencethat are hard to imagine unless you\\'ve had them. But it is not, as Iimplicitly believed before having kids, simply your DNA heading forthe lifeboats.Some of my worries about having kids were right, though. Theydefinitely make you less productive. I know having kids makes somepeople get their act together, but if your act was already together,you\\'re going to have less time to do it in. In particular, you\\'regoing to have to work to a schedule. Kids have schedules.  I\\'m notsure if it\\'s because that\\'s how kids are, or because it\\'s the onlyway to integrate their lives with adults\\', but once you have kids,you tend to have to work on their schedule.You will have chunks of time to work. But you can\\'t let work spillpromiscuously through your whole life, like I used to before I hadkids. You\\'re going to have to work at the same time every day,whether inspiration is flowing or not, and there are going to betimes when you have to stop, even if it is.I\\'ve been able to adapt to working this way. Work, like love, findsa way. If there are only certain times it can happen, it happensat those times. So while I don\\'t get as much done as before I hadkids, I get enough done.I hate to say this, because being ambitious has always been a partof my identity, but having kids may make one less ambitious. Ithurts to see that sentence written down. I squirm to avoid it. Butif there weren\\'t something real there, why would I squirm?  Thefact is, once you have kids, you\\'re probably going to care moreabout them than you do about yourself. And attention is a zero-sumgame. Only one idea at a time can be thetop idea in your mind.Once you have kids, it will often be your kids, and that means itwill less often be some project you\\'re working on.I have some hacks for sailing close to this wind. For example, whenI write essays, I think about what I\\'d want my kids to know. Thatdrives me to get things right. And when I was writingBel, I toldmy kids that once I finished it I\\'d take them to Africa. When yousay that sort of thing to a little kid, they treat it as a promise.Which meant I had to finish or I\\'d be taking away their trip toAfrica.  Maybe if I\\'m really lucky such tricks could put me netahead. But the wind is there, no question.On the other hand, what kind of wimpy ambition do you have if itwon\\'t survive having kids? Do you have so little to spare?And while having kids may be warping my present judgement, it hasn\\'toverwritten my memory. I remember perfectly well what life was likebefore. Well enough to miss some things a lot, like theability to take off for some other country at a moment\\'s notice.That was so great. Why did I never do that?See what I did there? The fact is, most of the freedom I had beforekids, I never used. I paid for it in loneliness, but I never usedit.I had plenty of happy times before I had kids. But if I count uphappy moments, not just potential happiness but actual happy moments,there are more after kids than before. Now I practically have iton tap, almost any bedtime.People\\'s experiences as parentsvary a lot, and I know I\\'ve been lucky. But I think the worries Ihad before having kids must be pretty common, and judging by otherparents\\' faces when they see their kids, so must the happiness thatkids bring.Note[1] Adults are sophisticated enough to see 2 year olds for thefascinatingly complex characters they are, whereas to most 6 yearolds, 2 year olds are just defective 6 year olds.'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Get funded byY Combinator.August 2007(This is a talk I gave at the last Y Combinator dinner of the summer. Usually we don\\'t have a speaker at the last dinner; it\\'s more ofa party.  But it seemed worth spoiling the atmosphere if I couldsave some of the startups frompreventable deaths.  So at the last minute I cooked up this rathergrim talk.  I didn\\'t mean this as an essay; I wrote it downbecause I only had two hours before dinner and think fastest whilewriting.)A couple days ago I told a reporter that we expected about a thirdof the companies we funded to succeed.  Actually I was beingconservative.  I\\'m hoping it might be as much as a half.  Wouldn\\'tit be amazing if we could achieve a 50% success rate?Another way of saying that is that half of you are going to die.  Phrasedthat way, it doesn\\'t sound good at all.  In fact, it\\'s kind of weirdwhen you think about it, because our definition of success is thatthe founders get rich.  If half the startups we fund succeed, thenhalf of you are going to get rich and the other half are going toget nothing.If you can just avoid dying, you get rich.  That sounds like a joke,but it\\'s actually a pretty good description of what happens in atypical startup.  It certainly describes what happened in Viaweb.We avoided dying till we got rich.It was really close, too.  When we were visiting Yahoo to talk aboutbeing acquired, we had to interrupt everything and borrow one oftheir conference rooms to talk down an investor who was about toback out of a new funding round we needed to stay alive.   So evenin the middle of getting rich we were fighting off the grim reaper.You may have heard that quote about luck consisting of opportunitymeeting preparation.  You\\'ve now done the preparation.  The workyou\\'ve done so far has, in effect, put you in a position to getlucky: you can now get rich by not letting your company die.  That\\'smore than most people have.  So let\\'s talk about how not to die.We\\'ve done this five times now, and we\\'ve seen a bunch of startupsdie.  About 10 of them so far.  We don\\'t know exactly what happenswhen they die, because they generally don\\'t die loudly and heroically.Mostly they crawl off somewhere and die.For us the main indication of impending doom is when we don\\'t hearfrom you.  When we haven\\'t heard from, or about, a startup for acouple months, that\\'s a bad sign.  If we send them an email askingwhat\\'s up, and they don\\'t reply, that\\'s a really bad sign.  So farthat is a 100% accurate predictor of death.Whereas if a startup regularly does new deals and releases andeither sends us mail or shows up at YC events, they\\'re probablygoing to live.I realize this will sound naive, but maybe the linkage works inboth directions.  Maybe if you can arrange that we keep hearingfrom you, you won\\'t die.That may not be so naive as it sounds.  You\\'ve probably noticedthat having dinners every Tuesday with us and the other founderscauses you to get more done than you would otherwise, because everydinner is a mini Demo Day.  Every dinner is a kind of a deadline.So the mere constraint of staying in regular contact with us willpush you to make things happen, because otherwise you\\'ll be embarrassedto tell us that you haven\\'t done anything new since the last timewe talked.If this works, it would be an amazing hack.  It would be prettycool if merely by staying in regular contact with us you could getrich.  It sounds crazy, but there\\'s a good chance that would work.A variant is to stay in touch with other YC-funded startups.  Thereis now a whole neighborhood of them in San Francisco.  If you movethere, the peer pressure that made you work harder all summer willcontinue to operate.When startups die, the official cause of death is always eitherrunning out of money or a critical founder bailing.  Often the twooccur simultaneously.  But I think the underlying cause is usuallythat they\\'ve become demoralized.  You rarely hear of a startupthat\\'s working around the clock doing deals and pumping out newfeatures, and dies because they can\\'t pay their bills and their ISPunplugs their server.Startups rarely die in mid keystroke.  So keep typing!If so many startups get demoralized and fail when merely by hangingon they could get rich, you have to assume that running a startupcan be demoralizing.  That is certainly true.  I\\'ve been there, andthat\\'s why I\\'ve never done another startup.  The low points in astartup are just unbelievably low.  I bet even Google had momentswhere things seemed hopeless.Knowing that should help.  If you know it\\'s going to feel terriblesometimes, then when it feels terrible you won\\'t think \"ouch, thisfeels terrible, I give up.\"  It feels that way for everyone.  Andif you just hang on, things will probably get better.  The metaphorpeople use to describe the way a startup feels is at least a rollercoaster and not drowning.  You don\\'t just sink and sink; there areups after the downs.Another feeling that seems alarming but is in fact normal in astartup is the feeling that what you\\'re doing isn\\'t working.  Thereason you can expect to feel this is that what you do probablywon\\'t work.  Startups almost never get it right the first time.Much more commonly you launch something, and no one cares.  Don\\'tassume when this happens that you\\'ve failed.  That\\'s normal forstartups.  But don\\'t sit around doing nothing.  Iterate.I like Paul Buchheit\\'s suggestion of trying to make something thatat least someone really loves.  As long as you\\'ve made somethingthat a few users are ecstatic about, you\\'re on the right track.  Itwill be good for your morale to have even a handful of users whoreally love you, and startups run on morale.  But also itwill tell you what to focus on.  What is it about you that theylove?  Can you do more of that?  Where can you find more people wholove that sort of thing?  As long as you have some core of userswho love you, all you have to do is expand it.  It may take a while,but as long as you keep plugging away, you\\'ll win in the end.  BothBlogger and Delicious did that.  Both took years to succeed.  Butboth began with a core of fanatically devoted users, and all Evanand Joshua had to do was grow that core incrementally.Wufooison the same trajectory now.So when you release something and it seems like no one cares, lookmore closely.  Are there zero users who really love you, or is thereat least some little group that does?  It\\'s quite possible therewill be zero.  In that case, tweak your product and try again.Every one of you is working on a space that contains at least onewinning permutation somewhere in it.  If you just keep trying,you\\'ll find it.Let me mention some things not to do.  The number one thing not todo is other things.  If you find yourself saying a sentence thatends with \"but we\\'re going to keep working on the startup,\" you arein big trouble.  Bob\\'s going to grad school, but we\\'re going tokeep working on the startup.  We\\'re moving back to Minnesota, butwe\\'re going to keep working on the startup.  We\\'re taking on someconsulting projects, but we\\'re going to keep working on the startup.You may as well just translate these to \"we\\'re giving up on thestartup, but we\\'re not willing to admit that to ourselves,\" becausethat\\'s what it means most of the time.  A startup is so hard thatworking on it can\\'t be preceded by \"but.\"In particular, don\\'t go to graduate school, and don\\'t start otherprojects.  Distraction is fatal to startups.  Going to (or back to)school is a huge predictor of death because in addition to thedistraction it gives you something to say you\\'re doing.  If you\\'reonly doing a startup, then if the startup fails, you fail.  Ifyou\\'re in grad school and your startup fails, you can say later \"Ohyeah, we had this startup on the side when I was in grad school,but it didn\\'t go anywhere.\"You can\\'t use euphemisms like \"didn\\'t go anywhere\" for somethingthat\\'s your only occupation.  People won\\'t let you.One of the most interesting things we\\'ve discovered from workingon Y Combinator is that founders are more motivated by the fear oflooking bad than by the hope of getting millions of dollars.   Soif you want to get millions of dollars, put yourself in a positionwhere failure will be public and humiliating.When we first met the founders ofOctopart, they seemed very smart,but not a great bet to succeed, because they didn\\'t seem especiallycommitted.  One of the two founders was still in grad school.  Itwas the usual story: he\\'d drop out if it looked like the startupwas taking off.  Since then he has not only dropped out of gradschool, but appeared full length inNewsweekwith the word \"Billionaire\"printed across his chest.  He just cannot fail now.  Everyone heknows has seen that picture.  Girls who dissed him in high schoolhave seen it.  His mom probably has it on the fridge.  It would beunthinkably humiliating to fail now.  At this point he is committedto fight to the death.I wish every startup we funded could appear in a Newsweek articledescribing them as the next generation of billionaires, becausethen none of them would be able to give up.  The success rate wouldbe 90%.  I\\'m not kidding.When we first knew the Octoparts they were lighthearted, cheeryguys.  Now when we talk to them they seem grimly determined.  Theelectronic parts distributors are trying to squash them to keeptheir monopoly pricing.  (If it strikes you as odd that people stillorder electronic parts out of thick paper catalogs in 2007, there\\'sa reason for that.  The distributors want to prevent the transparencythat comes from having prices online.)  I feel kind of bad thatwe\\'ve transformed these guys from lighthearted to grimly determined.But that comes with the territory.  If a startup succeeds, you getmillions of dollars, and you don\\'t get that kind of money just byasking for it.  You have to assume it takes some amount of pain.And however tough things get for the Octoparts, I predict they\\'llsucceed.  They may have to morph themselves into something totallydifferent, but they won\\'t just crawl off and die.  They\\'re smart;they\\'re working in a promising field; and they just cannot give up.All of you guys already have the first two.  You\\'re all smart andworking on promising ideas.  Whether you end up among the livingor the dead comes down to the third ingredient, not giving up.So I\\'ll tell you now: bad shit is coming.  It always is in a startup.The odds of getting from launch to liquidity without some kind ofdisaster happening are one in a thousand.  So don\\'t get demoralized.When the disaster strikes, just say to yourself, ok, this was whatPaul was talking about.  What did he say to do?  Oh, yeah.  Don\\'tgive up.Japanese TranslationArabic Translation'},\n",

       "  'essay_text': 'Many startups go through a point a few months before they die wherealthough they have a significant amount of money in the bank, they\\'realso losing a lot each month, and revenue growth is either nonexistentor mediocre.  The company has, say, 6 months of runway.  Or to putit more brutally, 6 months before they\\'re out of business.  Theyexpect to avoid that by raising more from investors.That last sentence is the fatal one.There may be nothing founders are so prone to delude themselvesabout as how interested investors will be in giving them additionalfunding.  It\\'s hard to convince investors the first time too, butfounders expect that.  What bites them the second time is a confluenceof three forces:The company is spending more now than it did the first time  it raised money.Investors have much higher standards for companies that have  already raised money.The company is now starting to read as a failure. The first  time it raised money, it was neither a success nor a failure; it  was too early to ask. Now it\\'s possible to ask that question, and  the default answer is failure, because at this point that is the  default outcome.I\\'m going to call the situation I described in the first paragraph \"the fatal pinch.\" I try to resistcoining phrases, but making up a name for this situation may snapfounders into realizing when they\\'re in it.One of the things that makes the fatal pinch so dangerous isthat it\\'s self-reinforcing.  Founders overestimate their chancesof raising more money, and so are slack about reachingprofitability, which further decreases their chances of raisingmoney.Now that you know about the fatal pinch, how do you avoid it?  Y\\xa0Combinator tellsfounders who raise money to act as if it\\'s the last they\\'ll everget.  Because the self-reinforcing nature of this situation worksthe other way too: the less you need further investment, the easierit is to get.What do you do if you\\'re already in the fatal pinch?  Thefirst step is to re-evaluate the probability of raising more money.I will now, by an amazing feat of clairvoyance, do this for you:the probability is zero.Three options remain: you can shut down the company, you can increasehow much you make, and you can decrease how much you spend.You should shut down the company if you\\'re certain it willfail no matter what you do.  Then at least you can give back themoney you have left, and save yourself however many months you wouldhave spent riding it down.Companies rarelyhaveto fail though.  What I\\'m really doinghere is giving you the option of admitting you\\'ve already given up.If you don\\'t want to shut down the company, that leaves increasingrevenues and decreasing expenses.  In most startups, expenses =people, and decreasing expenses = firing people.Deciding tofire people is usually hard, but there\\'s one case in which itshouldn\\'t be: when there are people you already know you shouldfire but you\\'re in denial about it.  If so, now\\'s the time.If that makes you profitable, or will enable you to make it toprofitability on the money you have left, you\\'ve avoided the immediatedanger.Otherwise you have three options: you either have to fire goodpeople, get some or all of the employees to take less salary for awhile, or increase revenues.Getting people to take less salary is a weak solution that willonly work when the problem isn\\'t too bad.  If your current trajectorywon\\'t quite get you to profitability but you can get over the thresholdby cutting salaries a little,you might be able to make the case to everyone for doing it.Otherwise you\\'re probably just postponing the problem, and thatwill be obvious to the people whose salaries you\\'re proposing tocut.Which leaves two options, firing good people and making more money.While trying to balance them, keep in mind the eventual goal: to bea successful product company in the sense of having a single thinglots of people use.You should lean more toward firing people if the source of yourtrouble is overhiring. If you went out and hired 15 people beforeyou even knew what you were building, you\\'ve created a brokencompany.  You need to figure out what you\\'re building, and it willprobably be easier to do that with a handful of people than 15.Plus those 15 people might not even be the ones you need for whateveryou end up building.  So the solution may be to shrink and thenfigure out what direction to grow in.  After all, you\\'re not doingthose 15 people any favors if you fly the company into ground withthem aboard.  They\\'ll all lose their jobs eventually, along withall the time they expended on this doomed company.Whereas if you only have a handful of people, it may be better tofocus on trying to make more money.  It may seem facile to suggesta startup make more money, as if that could be done for the asking.Usually a startup is already trying as hard as it can to sellwhatever it sells.  What I\\'m suggesting here is not so much to tryharder to make money but to try to make money in a different way.For example, if you have only one person selling while the rest arewriting code, consider having everyone work on selling.  What goodwill more code do you when you\\'re out of business?  If you have to write code to close a certain deal, go ahead;that follows from everyone working on selling.  But only work onwhatever will get you the most revenue the soonest.Another way to make money differently is to sell different things,and in particular to do more consultingish work.  I say consultingishbecause there is a long slippery slope from making products to pureconsulting, and you don\\'t have to go far down it before you startto offer something really attractive to customers. Although yourproduct may not be very appealing yet, if you\\'re a startup yourprogrammers will often be way better than the ones your customershave.  Or you may have expertise in some new field theydon\\'t understand.  So if you change your sales conversationsjust a little from \"do you want to buy our product?\" to \"what doyou need that you\\'d pay a lot for?\" you may find it\\'s suddenly alot easier to extract money from customers.Be ruthlessly mercenary when you start doing this, though. You\\'retrying to save your company from death here, so make customers paya lot, quickly. And to the extent you can, try to avoid theworst pitfalls of consulting.  The ideal thing might be if you builta precisely defined derivative version of your product for thecustomer, and it was otherwise a straight product sale.  You keepthe IP and no billing by the hour.In the best case, this consultingish work may not be just somethingyou do to survive, but may turn out to be thething-that-doesn\\'t-scalethat defines yourcompany.  Don\\'t expect it to be, but as you dive into individualusers\\' needs, keep your eyes open for narrow openings that havewide vistas beyond.There is usually so much demand for custom work that unless you\\'rereally incompetent there has to be some point down the slope ofconsulting at which you can survive.  But I didn\\'t use the termslippery slope by accident; customers\\' insatiable demand for customwork will always be pushing you toward the bottom.  So while you\\'llprobably survive, the problem now becomes to survive with the leastdamage and distraction.The good news is, plenty of successful startups have passed throughnear-death experiences and gone on to flourish.  You just have torealize in time that you\\'re near death.  And if you\\'re in the fatal pinch,you are.'}]"
